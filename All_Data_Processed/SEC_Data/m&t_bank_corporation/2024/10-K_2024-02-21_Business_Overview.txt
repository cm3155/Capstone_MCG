operations of wilmington trust na permissible activities under the bhca in general the bhca limits the business of a bhc to banking managing or controlling banks and other activities that the federal reserve has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto in addition bhcs are obligated by a federal reserve policy to serve as a managerial and financial source of strength to their subsidiary depository institutions including committing resources to support such subsidiaries this support may be required at times when mt may not be inclined or able to provide it in addition any capital loans by a bhc to a subsidiary bank are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary bank in the event of a bhcs bankruptcy any commitment by the bhc to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment a bhc that qualifies and elects to be a fhc may engage in any activity or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the federal reserve by regulation or order in consultation with the secretary of the treasury or ii complementary to a financial activity and does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally as solely determined by the federal reserve activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and merchant banking mt elected to become a fhc in march to maintain fhc status a fhc and all of its depository institution subsidiaries must be well capitalized and well managed the failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of mt and may also adversely affect mts ability to enter into certain transactions including acquisitions or obtain necessary approvals in connection with those transactions as well as loss of fhc status additionally if each of the companys depository institution subsidiaries has not received at least a satisfactory rating on its most recent examination under the cra the company would not be able to commence any new financial activities or acquire a company that engages in such activities although it would still be allowed to engage in activities closely related to banking and make investments in the ordinary course of conducting banking activities for a further discussion of the cra see the section captioned cra included herein enhanced prudential standards under section of the doddfrank act as amended by the egrrcpa us bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more including mt are subject to enhanced prudential standards the enhanced prudential standards include riskbased capital and leverage requirements liquidity standards risk management and risk committee requirements stress testing requirements and a debttoequity limit for companies that the financial stability oversight council has determined would pose a grave threat to systemic financial stability were they to fail such limits tailoring rules adopted by the federal reserve and other federal bank regulators in assign each us bhc with billion or more in total consolidated assets as well as its bank subsidiaries to one of four categories based on its size and five other riskbased indicators i crossjurisdictional activity ii weighted shortterm wholesale funding iii nonbank assets iv offbalance sheet exposure and v status as a us global systemically important bhc under the tailoring rules mt and its depository institution subsidiaries are subject to category iv standards which apply to banking organizations with at least billion in total consolidated assets that do not meet any of the thresholds specified for categories i through iii the threshold for category iii is billion or more in total consolidated assets or billion or more in total consolidated assets and at least billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets or offbalance sheet exposures under the tailoring rules category iv firms among other things i are not subject to any lcr or nsfr or in certain cases are subject to reduced requirements ii remain eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital iii are no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements iv are subject to supervisory stress testing on at least a biennial basis rather than an annual basis v are subject to requirements to develop and maintain a capital plan on an annual basis and vi are subject to certain liquidity risk management and risk committee requirements the federal reserve may impose more stringent requirements eg frequency of supervisory stress tests or capital plan submissions based on a companys financial condition size complexity risk profile scope of operations or activities or risks to the us economy category iv firms are not subject to i advanced approaches capital requirements ii the slr and iii the ccyb other elements of the tailoring rules are discussed in further detail throughout this section compared with category iv firms category iii firms are subject to the lcr and nsfr companyrun stress testing requirements annual instead of biennial supervisory stress tests the slr and the ccyb on july the federal reserve the fdic and the occ proposed revisions to the capital framework applicable to bhcs and their depository institution subsidiaries with billion or more in assets such as mt the proposed rule would introduce a new approach for calculating riskbased capital requirements and generally align the calculation of rwa and regulatory capital for firms in all four categories category iv firms would become subject to the slr and ccyb and would no longer be eligible to optout of the requirement to recognize most elements of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital those firms would be required to include all accumulated other comprehensive income components in regulatory capital except gains and losses on cash flow hedges those adjustments recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income among other items would include unrealized losses on availableforsale debt securities and any amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income attributed to defined benefit postretirement plans the inclusion of accumulated other comprehensive income components in regulatory capital would be subject to a phasein period beginning july until june with full inclusion of required accumulated other comprehensive income components starting july for further discussion of the proposed revisions to the capital framework see the section captioned capital requirements included herein capital requirements mt and its subsidiary banks are required to comply with applicable capital rules which are based on basel iii the capital rules include both riskbased requirements which compare three measures of capital to rwa as well as leverage requirements which in the case of category iv bhcs such as mt consist of the tier leverage ratio described below pursuant to the capital rules the minimum capital ratios are as follows cet1 to rwa tier capital that is cet1 plus additional tier capital to rwa total capital that is tier plus tier capital to rwa and tier capital to average consolidated assets the leverage ratio in calculating riskbased capital ratios mt must assign risk weights to the companys assets and offbalance sheet items mt has an ongoing process to review data elements associated with these exposures that from time to time may affect how specific exposures are classified and could lead to increases or decreases of the regulatory risk weights assigned to such exposures the capital rules also require firms to maintain a buffer consisting solely of cet1 capital in addition to the minimum riskbased requirements failure to satisfy the buffer requirement in full results in graduated constraints on capital distributions and discretionary executive compensation the severity of the constraints depends on the amount of the shortfall and the firms eligible retained income defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of net income over the preceding four quarters as a category iv bhc mts buffer requirement referred to as the scb is determined through the federal reserves supervisory stress tests discussed below for mts bank subsidiaries the buffer requirement consists of the static capital conservation buffer equal to of rwa cet1 consists of common stock instruments that meet the eligibility criteria in the capital rules including common stock and related surplus net of treasury stock retained earnings certain minority interests and for certain firms accumulated other comprehensive income as currently permitted under the capital rules mt made a onetime permanent election to neutralize certain accumulated other comprehensive income components with the result that those components are not recognized in mts cet1 the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 as a nonadvanced approaches firm under the capital rules mt is subject to rules that provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital mts and its subsidiary banks regulatory capital ratios are presented in note of notes to financial statements filed herewith in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data in december the basel committee published standards that it described as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms among other things these standards revise the basel committees standardized approach for credit risk including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments such as unused credit card lines of credit and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital under the current us capital rules operational risk capital requirements and a capital floor apply only to advanced approaches institutions and not to the company on july the federal reserve the fdic and the occ proposed revisions to the capital rules to implement the basel committees standards and make other changes to the capital rules the proposal introduces revised credit risk equity risk operational risk credit valuation adjustment risk and market risk requirements together the expanded riskbased approach the expanded riskbased approach would apply to category i through category iv firms and would replace the existing advanced approaches with respect to credit and operational risk under the proposal banking organizations with more than billion in total consolidated assets would be required to calculate rwas using the higher of i the expanded riskbased approach or ii the current standardized approach and revised market risk requirements calculating rwas under the expanded riskbased approach would impose additional operational costs including the costs to collect the data elements that would be used in the calculations in addition the proposal would subject category iv firms like mt to the deductions framework for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets and the methodology for calculating minority interest limitations currently applicable only to category i and category ii firms category iv firms would also no longer be eligible to optout of including certain components of accumulated other comprehensive income in regulatory capital stress testing and scb as part of the enhanced prudential requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions the federal reserve conducts periodic analyses of bhcs with at least billion in total consolidated assets using baseline and severely adverse economic and financial scenarios generated by the federal reserve for category iv firms such as mt these supervisory stress tests occur on a biennial basis in evennumbered years the federal reserve may also use additional components in the severely adverse scenario or additional or more complex scenarios designed to capture salient risks to specific business groups a summary of results of the federal reserves analysis under the severely adverse stress scenario is publicly disclosed by june each year under the tailoring rules category iv firms including mt are not subject to companyrun stress testing requirements the scb is based on a bhcs stressed losses in the supervisory stress test plus four quarters of planned common stock dividends subject to a floor of of rwas under the tailoring rules for category iv firms the portion of the scb based on the federal reserves supervisory stress tests will be calculated biennially in evennumbered years during a year in which a category iv firm does not undergo a supervisory stress test the firm will receive an updated scb that reflects the firms updated planned common stock dividends a category iv firm is also able to elect to participate in the supervisory stress test in a year in which the firm would not normally be subject to the supervisory stress test and consequently receive an updated scb the federal reserve may impose more stringent requirements eg frequency of supervisory stress tests or capital plan submissions based on various factors in connection with the acquisition of peoples united mt was required to participate in the supervisory stress test and received an updated scb in june the federal reserve released the results of its most recent supervisory stress tests based on those results on october mts scb of became effective accordingly it is currently subject to a cet1 capital requirement of a sum of the scb and the minimum cet1 capital ratio bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more including category iv bhcs such as mt must annually submit capital plans as part of the federal reserves process the comprehensive capital plans include a view of capital adequacy under various scenarios including a bhcdefined baseline scenario a baseline scenario provided by the federal reserve at least one bhcdefined stress scenario and any severely adverse scenario provided by the federal reserve a bhcs planned capital distributions in its annual capital plan submissions must be consistent with any effective distribution limitations that would apply under the firms own baseline projections including its scb the process is intended to help ensure that these bhcs have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress each of the bhcs participating in the process is also required to collect and report certain related data to the federal reserve on a regular basis the federal reserve incorporates an assessment of the qualitative aspects of the firms capital planning process into regular ongoing supervisory activities and through targeted horizontal assessments of particular aspects of capital planning mts annual capital plan is currently due in april each year distributions mt is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and other subsidiaries historically the majority of mts revenue has been from dividends paid to mt by its subsidiary banks mt bank and wilmington trust na are subject to laws and regulations imposing restrictions on the amount of dividends they may declare and pay future dividend payments to mt by its subsidiary banks will be dependent on a number of factors including the earnings and financial condition of each such bank and are subject to the limitations referred to in note of notes to financial statements filed herewith in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data and to other statutory powers of bank regulatory agencies an idi is prohibited from making any capital distribution to its owner including any dividend if after making such distribution the depository institution fails to meet the required minimum level for any relevant capital measure including the riskbased capital adequacy and leverage standards discussed herein dividend payments by mt to its shareholders and common stock repurchases by mt are subject to the oversight of the federal reserve mts ability to make capital distributions would likely be impacted in the event that mt fails to maintain its scb above its minimum cet1 riskbased tier1 riskbased and total riskbased capital requirements in addition the federal reserves capital plan rule also provides that a bhc must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bhc is required to resubmit its capital plan among other circumstances a firm may be required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with certain acquisitions or dispositions liquidity under the tailoring rules as a category iv firm the company is not subject to the federal reserve and other federal banking regulators rules that implement a us version of the basel committees lcr requirement which is intended to ensure that banks hold sufficient amounts of socalled high quality liquid assets to cover the anticipated net cash outflows during a hypothetical acute 30day stress scenario or the nsfr which is designed to promote more medium and longterm funding of the assets and activities of banks over a oneyear time horizon the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards however require the company as a bhc with billion or more in total consolidated assets to comply with enhanced liquidity and overall risk management standards which include maintaining a level of highly liquid assets based on projected funding needs for days and increased involvement by boards of directors in liquidity and overall risk management under the tailoring rules the liquidity risk management and reporting requirements are less stringent for category iv bhcs as compared with bhcs in a different category cross guaranty provision the cross guaranty provisions in the fdia require each idi owned by the same bhc to be financially responsible for the failure or resolution costs of any affiliated insured institution generally the amount of the cross guaranty liability is equal to the estimated loss to the dif for the resolution of the affiliated institutions in default the fdics claim under the cross guaranty provision is superior to claims of shareholders of the idi or its bhc and to most claims arising out of obligations or liabilities owed to affiliates of the institution but is subordinate to claims of depositors secured creditors and holders of subordinated debt other than affiliates of the commonly controlled idi the fdic may decline to enforce the cross guaranty provision if it determines that a waiver is in the best interest of the dif volcker rule the volcker rule limits proprietary trading and investing in and sponsoring certain hedge funds and private equity funds defined as covered funds in the volcker rule the company does not engage in any significant amount of proprietary trading as defined in the volcker rule and implemented the required procedures for those areas in which trading does occur in addition the company does not engage in any significant covered fund activities that are impacted by the volcker rule safety and soundness standards guidelines adopted by the federal bank regulatory agencies pursuant to the fdia establish general standards relating to internal controls information systems internal audit systems loan documentation credit underwriting interest rate exposure asset growth compensation fees and benefits in general these guidelines require among other things appropriate systems and practices to identify and manage the risk and exposures specified in the guidelines additionally the agencies adopted regulations that authorize but do not require an agency to order an institution that has been given notice by an agency that it is not satisfying any of such safety and soundness standards to submit a compliance plan if after being so notified an institution fails to submit an acceptable compliance plan or fails in any material respect to implement an acceptable compliance plan the agency must issue an order directing action to correct the deficiency and may issue an order directing other actions of the types to which an undercapitalized institution is subject if an institution fails to comply with such an order the agency may seek to enforce such order in judicial proceedings and to impose civil money penalties limits on undercapitalized depository institutions the fdia establishes a system of regulatory remedies to resolve the problems of undercapitalized institutions referred to as the prompt corrective action the federal banking regulators have established five capital categories well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and must take certain mandatory supervisory actions and are authorized to take other discretionary actions with respect to institutions which are undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized the severity of these mandatory and discretionary supervisory actions depends upon the capital category in which the institution is placed the federal banking regulators have specified by regulation the relevant capital levels for each category under existing rules a depository institution is deemed to be well capitalized if it has i a cet1 ratio of at least ii a tier capital ratio of at least iii a total capital ratio of at least and iv a tier leverage ratio of at least the fdias prompt corrective action provisions only apply to depository institutions and not to bhcs the federal reserves regulations applicable to bhcs separately define well capitalized a fhc that is not well capitalized and well managed or whose bank subsidiaries are not well capitalized and well managed under applicable prompt corrective action standards may be restricted in certain of its activities and ultimately may lose fhc status an institution that is categorized as undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized or critically undercapitalized is required to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan to its appropriate federal banking regulator under the fdia in order for the capital restoration plan to be accepted by the appropriate federal banking agency a bhc must guarantee that a subsidiary depository institution will comply with its capital restoration plan subject to certain limitations the bhc must also provide appropriate assurances of performance an undercapitalized institution is also generally prohibited from increasing its average total assets accepting brokered deposits or offering interest rates on any deposits significantly higher than prevailing market rates making acquisitions establishing any branches or engaging in any new line of business except in accordance with an accepted capital restoration plan or with the approval of the fdic institutions that are significantly undercapitalized or undercapitalized and either fail to submit an acceptable capital restoration plan or fail to implement an approved capital restoration plan may be subject to a number of requirements and restrictions including orders to sell sufficient voting stock to become adequately capitalized requirements to reduce total assets and cessation of receipt of deposits from correspondent banks critically undercapitalized depository institutions failing to submit or implement an acceptable capital restoration plan are subject to appointment of a receiver or conservator transactions with affiliates there are various legal restrictions on the extent to which mt and its nonbank subsidiaries or affiliates may borrow or otherwise obtain funding from mt bank and wilmington trust na in general sections and of the federal reserve act and federal reserve regulation w require that any covered transaction by mt bank and wilmington trust na or any of their respective subsidiaries with an affiliate must in certain cases be secured by designated amounts of specified collateral and must be limited as follows i in the case of any single such affiliate the aggregate amount of covered transactions of the idi and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of such idi and ii in the case of all affiliates the aggregate amount of covered transactions of an idi and its subsidiaries may not exceed of the capital stock and surplus of such idi covered transactions are defined by statute to include among other things a loan or extension of credit as well as a purchase of securities issued by an affiliate a purchase of assets unless otherwise exempted by the federal reserve from the affiliate certain derivative transactions that create a credit exposure to an affiliate the acceptance of securities issued by the affiliate as collateral for a loan and the issuance of a guarantee acceptance or letter of credit on behalf of an affiliate all covered transactions including certain additional transactions such as transactions with a third party in which an affiliate has a financial interest must be conducted on terms and under circumstances including credit standards i that are substantially the same or at least as favorable to such bank or its subsidiary as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with or involving other nonaffiliated companies or in the absence of comparable transactions ii that in good faith would be offered to or would apply to nonaffiliated companies fdic insurance assessments mt bank and wilmington trust na deposits are insured by the dif of the fdic up to the limits set forth under applicable law the fdic imposes a riskbased premium assessment system that determines assessment rates for financial institutions deposit insurance assessments are based on average total assets minus average tangible equity for larger institutions such as mt bank the fdic uses a performance score and a lossseverity score to calculate an initial assessment rate in calculating these scores the fdic uses a banks capital level and supervisory ratings and certain financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress the fdic has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the total score based upon significant risk factors that are not adequately captured in the calculations under the current system premiums are assessed quarterly under the fdia insurance of deposits may be terminated by the fdic upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic in october the fdic finalized a rule that increased initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic as required under the fdia established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of percent within eight years the increased assessment is intended to improve the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline of september on november the fdic finalized a rule that imposes a special assessment to recover the costs to the dif resulting from the fdics use in of the systemic risk exception to the leastcost resolution test under the fdia in connection with the receiverships of certain failed banks the fdic estimated in approving the rule that those assessed losses total approximately billion the rule provides that this loss estimate will be periodically adjusted which will affect the amount of the special assessment under the rule the assessment base is the estimated uninsured deposits that an idi reported in its consolidated report of condition and income at december excluding the first billion in estimated uninsured deposits for a holding company that has more than one idi subsidiary such as mt the billion exclusion is allocated among the companys idi subsidiaries in proportion to each idis estimated uninsured deposits the special assessments will be collected at an annual rate of approximately basis points per year basis points per quarter over eight quarters in and with the first assessment period beginning january because the estimated loss pursuant to the systemic risk determination will be periodically adjusted the fdic retains the ability to cease collection early extend the special assessment collection period and impose a final shortfall special assessment on a onetime basis the special assessments are tax deductible the total of the assessments for mt is estimated at million and such amount was recorded as an expense in the fourth quarter of when the final rule was enacted acquisitions federal and state laws impose notice and approval requirements for mergers and acquisitions involving depository institutions or bhcs for example the bhca requires every bhc to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before i it may acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank or savings institution if after such acquisition the bhc will directly or indirectly own or control or more of the voting shares of the institution ii it or any of its subsidiaries other than a bank may acquire all or substantially all of the assets of any bank or savings institution or iii it may merge or consolidate with any other bhc in addition fhcs are required to obtain prior approval from the federal reserve before acquiring certain nonbank financial companies with assets exceeding billion the bhca further provides that the federal reserve may not approve any transaction that would result in a monopoly or would be in furtherance of any combination or conspiracy to monopolize or attempt to monopolize the business of banking in any section of the us or the effect of which may be to substantially lessen competition or to tend to create a monopoly in any section of the country or that in any other manner would be in restraint of trade unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the public interest in meeting the convenience and needs of the community to be served the federal reserve is also required to consider the financial and managerial resources and future prospects of the bhcs and banks concerned and the convenience and needs of the community to be served consideration of financial resources generally focuses on capital adequacy and consideration of convenience and needs issues and includes the parties performance under the cra and compliance with laws especially consumer protection laws when evaluating a transaction the federal reserve must also take into account the institutions effectiveness in combating money laundering and consider the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the us banking or financial system executive and incentive compensation guidelines adopted by several federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal stockholder the federal reserve issued incentive compensation guidance intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the incentive compensation guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to effectively identify and manage risks ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors these three principles are incorporated into the proposed joint compensation regulations under the doddfrank act any deficiencies in compensation practices that are identified may be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect its ability to make acquisitions or perform other actions the incentive compensation guidance states that enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related riskmanagement control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies the doddfrank act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets such as mt and mt bank the agencies proposed rules to implement this requirement but these proposed rules have not been finalized in october the sec adopted a final rule directing national securities exchanges and associations including the nyse to require policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentivebased compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period the excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentivebased compensation been determined using the restated financials the nyses listing standards pursuant to the secs rule became effective october mts clawback policy adopted in accordance with these listing standards is included as exhibit to this annual report on cycle pursuant to this filing cycle mt bank submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic in november on august the fdic proposed amendments to the resolution planning requirements for idis with billion or more in total assets under the proposed revisions idis such as mt bank with billion or more in total assets would be required to submit resolution plans on a twoyear cycle with an interim supplement updating key information submitted in the off years the proposed rule would among other things revise the required contents of a resolution plan for an idi with billion or more in total assets and address the idis capabilities to produce valuations that the fdic could use to conduct the statutorily required leastcost analysis in the event of the idis failure on august the federal reserve the fdic and the occ issued a proposed rule that would require category ii through category iv bhcs and idis with billion or more in consolidated assets as well as their idi affiliates to maintain minimum amounts of eligible longterm debt generally debt that is unsecured has a maturity greater than one year from issuance and satisfies additional criteria subject to a threeyear phasein period under the proposal bhcs and idis would be required to maintain eligible longterm debt in an amount equal to the greatest of of rwas of total consolidated assets and if subject to the slr of total leverage exposure the denominator of the slr the proposal would also apply clean holding company requirements to category ii through iv bhcs which would among other things prohibit entering into derivatives and certain other financial contracts with third parties insolvency of an idi or a bhc if the fdic is appointed as conservator or receiver for an idi such as mt bank or wilmington trust na upon its insolvency or in certain other events without limitation the fdic has the power to transfer any of the depository institutions assets and liabilities to a new depository institution including a newly formed bridge bank without the approval of the insolvent depository institutions creditors or equity holders to enforce the terms of the depository institutions contracts pursuant to their terms without regard to any provisions triggered by the appointment of the fdic in that capacity or to repudiate or disaffirm any contract or lease to which the depository institution is a party the performance of which is determined by the fdic to be burdensome and the disaffirmance or repudiation of which is determined by the fdic to promote the orderly administration of the depository institution in addition under federal law the claims of holders of domestic deposit liabilities and certain claims for administrative expenses against an idi institution would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution including claims of debt holders of the institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver as a result whether or not the fdic ever sought to repudiate any debt obligations of mt bank or wilmington trust na the debt holders would be treated differently from and could receive if anything substantially less than the depositors of the bank the doddfrank act created a new resolution regime known as orderly liquidation authority for systemically important financial companies including bhcs and their affiliates under the orderly liquidation authority the fdic may be appointed as receiver for the systemically important institution and its failed subsidiaries for purposes of liquidating the entity if among other conditions it is determined at the time of the institutions failure that it is in default or in danger of default and the failure poses a risk to the stability of the us financial system if the fdic is appointed as receiver under the orderly liquidation authority then the powers of the receiver and the rights and obligations of creditors and other parties who have dealt with the institution would be determined under the doddfrank act provisions and not under the insolvency law that would otherwise apply the powers of the receiver under the orderly liquidation authority were based on the powers of the fdic as receiver for depository institutions under the fdia however the provisions governing the rights of creditors under the orderly liquidation authority were modified in certain respects to reduce disparities with the treatment of creditors claims under the us bankruptcy code as compared with the treatment of those claims under the new authority nonetheless substantial differences in the rights of creditors exist as between these two regimes including the right of the fdic to disregard the strict priority of creditor claims in some circumstances the use of an administrative claims procedure to determine creditors claims as opposed to the judicial procedure utilized in bankruptcy proceedings and the right of the fdic to transfer claims to a bridge entity an olf will fund such liquidation proceedings through borrowings from the treasury department and riskbased assessments made first on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as mt if an orderly liquidation is triggered mt could face assessments for the olf the fdic has developed a strategy under the orderly liquidation authority referred to as the single point of entry strategy under which the fdic would resolve a failed fhc by transferring its assets including shares of its operating subsidiaries and potentially very limited liabilities to a bridge holding company utilize the resources of the failed fhc to recapitalize the operating subsidiaries and satisfy the claims of unsecured creditors of the failed fhc and other claimants in the receivership by delivering securities of one or more new financial companies that would emerge from the bridge holding company under this strategy management of the failed fhc would be replaced and shareholders and creditors of the failed fhc would bear the losses resulting from the failure depositor preference under federal law depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses and employee compensation against an idi would be afforded a priority over other general unsecured claims against such an institution in the liquidation or other resolution of such an institution by any receiver if an idi fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including depositors whose deposits are payable only outside of the us and the parent bhc with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such idi financial privacy and cybersecurity the federal banking regulators have adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic and personally identifiable information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and conveyed to outside vendors in addition consumers may also prevent disclosure of certain information among affiliated companies that is assembled or used to determine eligibility for a product or service such as that shown on consumer credit reports and asset and income information from applications consumers also have the option to direct banks and other financial institutions not to share information about transactions and experiences with affiliated companies for the purpose of marketing products or services federal law makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means the federal banking agencies require banking organizations to notify their primary regulator as soon as possible and within hours of determining that a notification incident has occurred a notification incident is a computersecurity incident that has materially disrupted or degraded or is reasonably likely to materially disrupt or degrade the banking organizations ability to deliver services to a material portion of its customer base jeopardize the viability of key operations of the banking organization or impact the stability of the financial sector the final rule also requires specific and immediate notifications by bank service providers that become aware of similar incidents financial institutions regulated by the nysdfs including mt bank are also subject to nysdfs regulations on cybersecurity matters including among other things requirements to i establish and maintain a cybersecurity program designed to ensure the confidentiality integrity and availability of their information systems ii implement and maintain a written cybersecurity policy setting forth policies and procedures for the protection of their information systems and nonpublic information and iii designate a ciso on november the nysdfs adopted amendments to its cybersecurity regulations that represent a significant update to the regulation of cybersecurity practices the amendments generally fall within the following five categories i increased mandatory controls associated with common attack vectors ii enhanced requirements for privileged accounts iii enhanced notification obligations iv expansion of cyber governance practices and v additional cybersecurity requirements for larger companies most of the amendments will become effective days after adoption on july the sec adopted new rules that require registrants such as mt to i report material cybersecurity incidents on form 8k and ii disclose in its annual report on s in
