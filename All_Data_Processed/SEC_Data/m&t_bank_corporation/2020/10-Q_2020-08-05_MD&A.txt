item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mt bank corporation mt recorded net income in the second quarter of of million or of diluted earnings per common share compared with million or of diluted earnings per common share in the yearearlier quarter net income and diluted earnings per common share during the first quarter of were million and respectively basic earnings per common share were in the recent quarter compared with in the year earlier quarter and in the initial quarter of net income totaled million or of diluted and basic earnings per common share in the first half of compared with million or of diluted and basic earnings per common share in the corresponding period of the annualized rate of return on average total assets for mt and its consolidated subsidiaries the company in the second quarter of was compared with in the yearearlier quarter and in the first quarter of the annualized rate of return on average common shareholders equity was in the recent quarter compared with in the second quarter of and in 2020s initial quarter during the sixmonth period ended june the annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders equity were and respectively compared with and respectively in the similar period of effective january mt adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new accounting guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of january additional information on the new accounting guidance is provided under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements financial results for the second quarter of were adversely impacted by the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic the economic outlook at june deteriorated as compared with what had been assumed by the company as of the end of the first quarter of with considerable uncertainty existing about the length and extent of the pandemics impact on the nations economy due to higher expected credit losses that reflect the worsening outlook the provision for credit losses in the recent quarter rose to million from million in the initial quarter and million in the second quarter of the periods reflect the adoption of the new accounting guidance for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments spurred by the covid19 pandemic the low interest rate environment has resulted in decreased taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter while waivers and reduced customer transaction activity led to lower fees earned on deposit accounts on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law among other things the cares act provides relief to borrowers including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing and also provides funding opportunities for small businesses under the paycheck protection program ppp from approved small business administration sba lenders including mt bank for commercial and consumer customers the company has provided a host of relief options including loan maturity extensions payment deferrals fee waivers and low interest rate loan products during the second quarter of mt bank funded ppp loans that totaled billion at june updated economic forecasts at june and at march resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio than at january resulting in significant increases in the provision for credit losses in the first two quarters of the company expects that it will continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic after june and believes that the pandemic could have a material impact on its future financial results specifically the company expects the following balance sheet and income statement categories to be affected mt bank is an approved lender in the main street lending program a provision of the cares act customer demand for this borrowing opportunity is not fully known so that potential impact is not determinable net interest income and net interest margin the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the companys net interest margin provision for credit losses deteriorating economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could result in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses than have been historically experienced in addition the impact on borrowers ability to repay loans could be negatively affected potentially leading to increased chargeoffs noninterest income will likely be lower as it relates to the trust businesses as it is likely that fee waivers will increase for proprietary money market mutual fund management fees and some of trust income is derived from equity market performance which could be volatile the potential for a prolonged slowdown in debt capital market activities also exists consumer deposit service charge fees may continue to be lower than historical levels due to fee waivers and lower debit card transactions credit card interchange volumes are also expected to be lower than historical norms resulting in lower fees residential mortgage applications are expected to continue to be strong given the low interest rate environment and the resurgence of the epidemic in many parts of the country has resulted in certain government mandates that will impact aspects of the companys expense base such as the use of contractors travel and entertainment costs and other types of discretionary expenditures in addition the company has curtailed hiring and has redeployed employees to address the changing dynamics of the business given the current environment the national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees the company has taken actions to provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways examples of those actions include the deployment of a pandemic response plan to manage the pandemics effects on operations employees and customers including seeking to ensure employee safety maintain continuity of operations and service levels for customers preserve the companys financial strength and comply with applicable laws and regulations actions have included placing restrictions on travel implementing a modified branch service model implementing social distancing requirements and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home the company has formed a task force to develop a plan for employees to return to the office when deemed appropriate while ensuring a safe work environment nearly all mt bank branches remain open with open lobbies or with inperson visits by appointment and normal access to drivethrough windows and atms nearly of the companys nonbranch employees continue to work remotely loan customers are receiving covid19 related relief in various forms including modification and forbearance requests as of june as follows commercial customers with balances of

customers with balances of million paycheck protection program at june customers have outstanding loans totaling billion and waiving certain types of transaction and maintenance fees for consumer and small business deposit account relationships in july mt agreed to sell its noncontrolling interest in an asset manager obtained in the acquisi tion of wilmington trust corporation that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting and as a result as of june recorded a million charge reflected in other costs of operations to reduce the carrying value of the invest ment to its net realizable value similar to other active investment managers the investee entity had experienced a decrease in assets under management and during the second quarter of the entitys chief executive and investment officer announced hi s retirement following that announcement successor management submitted a proposal to mt to restructure the organization of the entity the aftertax impact of the charge was a reduction in net income of million or of diluted earnings per comm on share in the second quarter of the sale of mts interest in the asset manager was effective september during the first quarter of the company increased its reserve for legal matters by million in conjunction with matters associated with a subsidiarys role as trustee of employee stock ownership plans in its institutional client services business that increase on an aftertax basis reduced net income in that quarter by million or of diluted earnings per common share also during that quarter mt realized million of distributed income from bayview lending group llc blg increasing net income by million or of diluted earnings per common share a similar distribution of million was received in the first quarter of increasing net income by million or of diluted earnings per common share supplemental reporting of nongaap results of operations mt consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and expenses associated with merging acquired operations when incurred into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income totaled million in the second quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the initial quarter diluted net

provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the second quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter that decline resulted predominantly from a basis point hundredths of one percent narrowing of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the second quarter of the narrowing of the net interest margin was largely the result of declines in rates on loans and deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the federal reserve to decrease its target federal funds rate three times in the second half of each by a increment and twice in march of first by than another by the impact of the recent quarters lower net interest margin on net interest income was partially offset by an increase in average earning

the net interest margin from in the prior quarter partially offset by a billion rise in average earning assets the increase in average earning assets in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarte r of and the initial quarter of resulted from higher average balances of loans and leases and interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york partially offset by lower average investment securities balances for the first six months of taxableequivalent net interest income was billion down from billion in the corresponding period that decrease was primarily attributable to a

quarter of down billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter and million lower than the billion averaged in the first quarter of for the first six months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively the lower average balances in the recent periods reflect maturities of us treasury notes and pay downs of mortgagebacked securities there were no significant sales of investment securities during the first six months of or during the first quarter of the company purchased million of us treasury notes there were no other significant purchases of investment securities during the first six months of or the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is predominantly comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities short term us treasury and federal agency notes and certain other debt and marketable equity securities investment securities also include capital stock of the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by factors such as demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized gains on such equity securities were million in the recent quarter compared with net unrealized gains of million in the second quarter of and net unrealized losses of million in the initial quarter net unrealized losses on equity securities were million during the first six months of compared with net unrealized gains of million in the prior year period those gains and losses were predominantly related to the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognize d in either of the sixmonth periods ended june or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of june the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated lo sses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and other banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion for the three months ended june and billion for each of the threemonth periods ended june and march the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york the levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trustrelated deposits and other deposits of commercial entities purchases or maturities of investment securities or borrowings to manage the companys liquidity the higher amount at june as compared with the earlier dates noted reflects the impact of increased commercial and consumer deposit balances as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion in the second quarter of and billion in the initial quarter average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first six months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the similar quarter and billion in the first quarter of the increase in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of and 2020s initial quarter reflected higher balances of noninterestbearing deposits and savings and interestchecking deposits average balances of savings and interestchecking core deposits rose billion or to billion in the second quarter from billion in the yearearlier quarter average noninterestbearing deposits increased billion or to billion in the recent quarter from billion in the second quarter those increases were largely due to higher average deposits of commercial customers but also reflect higher levels of consumer deposits and deposits associated with residential mortgage servicing activities in late march commercial customers drew down available lines of credit for liquidity purposes a large portion of those funds were placed in customer deposit accounts at mt bank by the end of the second quarter a significant portion of those line advances had been repaid by customers average core deposits were billion in the first quarter of average savings and interestchecking core deposits increased billion or in the second quarter from billion in the immediately preceding quarter average noninterestbearing deposits in the recent quarter were billion or above the first quarter average of billion predominantly due to higher deposits of commercial customers the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent increase decrease from 2nd qtr 2nd qtr 1st qtr in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over deposits associated with the companys cayman islands office and brokered deposits time deposits over excluding brokered deposits averaged million in the recent quarter compared with billion in the second quarter of and million in the initial quarter the decreases in such deposits since the second quarter of were predominantly the result of maturities of higherrate time deposits cayman islands office deposits averaged billion billion and billion for the quarters ended june june and march respectively the decrease in such deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of and the first quarter of reflected customer reaction to the declines in shortterm interest rates that followed actions by the federal reserve in march the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts which in the aggregate averaged billion during the recent quarter compared with billion in each of the second quarter of and the first quarter of the amounts of cayman islands office deposits or brokered deposits is largely dependent on demand by customers and other investors for those types of deposit products the table below summarizes average total deposits for the quarters ended june march and june average deposits retail trust commercial and other total in millions three months ended

islands office total the company also uses borrowings from banks securities dealers various federal home loan banks the federal reserve bank of new york and others as sources of funding shortterm borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less average shortterm borrowings totaled million in the second quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and million in the initial quarter in general the higher shortterm borrowings in the prior year period were entered into for liquidity management purposes longterm borrowings averaged billion in the two most recent quarters and billion in the second quarter of average balances of outstanding senior notes were billion billion and billion during the three months ended june june and march respectively on january mt bank the principal bank subsidiary of mt redeemed million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on february in addition mt bank redeemed million of fixed rate senior notes in july that were due to mature on august subordinated capital notes included in longterm borrowings averaged billion in each of the threemonth periods ended june june and march junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million million and million during the second quarters of and and the initial quarter respectively additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note of notes to financial statements longterm borrowings also included agreements to repurchase securities which averaged million in each of the first two quarters of and million in the second quarter of the repurchase agreement held at june totaled million and matured in july net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter compared with in the second quarter of the yield on earning assets during the second quarter of was down basis points from in the yearearlier period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities declined basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the first quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the narrowing of the net interest spread in the recent quarter as compared with the corresponding period and the initial quarter of reflects the impact of the decreases in shortterm interest rates initiated by the federal reserve during the second half of and in march for the first six months of the net interest spread was down basis points from in the yearearlier period the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing l iabilities for the first half of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial six months of net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the initial quarter the increase in average net interestfree funds in the most recent quarter as compared with the prior periods reflects higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits those deposits averaged billion billion and billion in the quarters ended june june and march respectively the rise in such balances in the recent quarter as compared with the earlier periods was largely due to increased levels of deposits of commercial customers during the first six months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended june billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the initial quarter goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in each of the two most recent quarters and in the quarter ended june the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in each of the threemonth periods ended june june and march increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the second quarter of compared with and in the second quarter of and the first quarter of respectively the reduced contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the two most recent quarters as compared with the second quarter of reflects the lower rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds the contribution of net interestfree funds in the first half of and was and respectively reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the second quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period and in the initial quarter of during the first six months of and the net interest margin was and respectively future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at june billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at june and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion that were in effect at each of june june and december were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans at june june and december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion billion and billion respectively were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company has entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate sw ap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest ra te swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or los s is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the derivatives gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted fo r similar to that associated with fair value hedges the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended june june and march were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily resu lt from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the weightedaverage rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were and respectively at june the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are

effect during the period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period in addition to interest rate swap agreements the company had entered into interest rate floor agreements that were accounted for in the tr ading account rather than as hedging instruments but nevertheless provided the company with protection against the possibility of future declines in interest rates on earning assets at each of june and december outstanding notional a mounts of such agreements totaled billion the interest rate floor agreements matured during the first quarter of as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the company and are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits cayman islands office deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at june and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively shortterm federal funds borrowings outstanding were billion at june there were no such borrowings outstanding at june or december in general those borrowings were unsecured matured on the next business day and were entered into for liquidity management purposes while predominantly used to satisfy customer demand cayman islands office deposits may also be used by the company as an alternative to shortterm borrowings cayman islands office deposits totaled million at june billion at june and billion at december the company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestbearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at june billion at june and billion at december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such impact by performing stress tests that assess the effect on liquidity resulting from various levels of internal and external stress factors the liquidity impact of such events is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not material at june or december the total amounts of vrdbs out standing backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at june compared with million at june and million at december mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at june approximately million was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at june and december were million and million respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at june and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at june the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability commi ttee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in m odeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelations hips in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate ris k through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates june december in thousands basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading

are presented in note of notes to financial statements the amounts of gross and net trading account positions as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the company are subject to a welldefined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by mts board of dir ectors however as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the companys trading account activities the notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled

billion and million respectively at june and million and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at june have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and billion respectively and at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the higher balance of trading account assets at june as compared with december was largely the result of increased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments

associated with trading account activities was not material however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys trading account activities additional information about the companys use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note of notes to financial statements provision for credit losses as described in note of notes to financial statements effective january the company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses at january increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans reflecting the longerdated maturities of such portfolios were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan products due to the assumption that the company could require full repayment of such loans in the nearterm the following table depicts the changes in the allowance for credit losses by loan category resulting from the adoption of the amended guidance impact of adoption of amended accounting guidanc e on allowance for credit losses balance december impact of adoption increase decrease balance january in thousands commercial financial leasing etc commercial real estate residential real estate consumer unallocated total the amended guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to be reflected in the allowance for credit losses previously such losses were netted in the carrying value of the loans unless there was an increased loss expectation subsequent to their acquisition the grossup of the estimated losses on loans acquired at a discount that was previously not recognized in the allowance for credit losses was million on january prior to january the company generally recognized interest income on loans acquired at a discount regardless of the borrowers repayment status effective with the adoption of the new accounting guidance the companys nonaccrual loan policy now applies to loans acquired at a discount loans acquired at a discount at december included million of loans that effective with the adoption of the new guidance were classified as nonaccrual loans on january a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management the provision for credit losses in the second quarter of was million compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the initial quarter of as noted earlier the significant increases in the provision in the two most recent quarters as compared with the second quarter of follow the adoption of new accounting guidance on january and

balances of the repurchased loans that are guaranteed by governmentrelated entities totaled million at june million a year earlier million at december and million at march the increase in such loans

considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal loans that were days past due were million at june compared with billion at december and billion at march the lower level of such past due loans at the recent quarter end was a result of loan paydowns many of which resulted in return to current status and migrations of loans to nonaccrual status covid19 related payment deferral modifications which largely occurred in the second quarter of resulted in such loans being classified as current in accordance with regulatory guidance and as a result did not contribute in incremental additions to loans categorized as days past due prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard on january the company reported purchased impaired loans those loans were impaired at the date of acquisition were recorded at estimated fair value and were generally delinquent in payments but in accordance with gaap the company continued to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans the amended accounting guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to now be reflected in the allowance for credit losses and effective with the adoption of the guidance the companys nonaccrual loan policy now applies to such loans the carrying amount of purchased impaired loans was million at june and million a t december the united states has been operating under a state of emergency related to the covid19 pandemic since march the direct and indirect effects of the covid19 pandemic have resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that has severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations the cares act in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers created a forbearance program for federallybacked mortgage loans protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under gaap related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of covid19 the banking regulatory agencies have likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 that guidance with concurrence of the financial accounting standards board and provisions of the cares act allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief to not be treated as troubled debt restructurings modifications may include payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other delays in payment the company continues to work with its customers affected by covid19 and as previously noted has granted a significant amount of modifications across many of its loan portfolios to the extent that such modifications met the criteria previously described such modifications have not been classified as troubled debt restructurings the company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the covid19 pandemic if the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted the company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments the objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net chargeoffs the modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses information about modifications of loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings is included in note of notes to financial statements residential real estate loans modified under specified loss mitigation programs prescribed by government guarantors that were not related to the covid19 pandemic have not been included in renegotiated loans because the loan guarantee remains in full force and accordingly the company has not granted a concession with respect to

for credit losses under new accounting guidance that requires estimating the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and leases portfolio a description of the methodologies used by the company to estimate its allowance for credit losses in can be found in note of notes to financial statements contained in this quarterly report on s at june approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status at june the balance of junior lien loans and lines that were in nonaccrual status solely as a result of first lien loan performance was million compared with million at june and million at each of december and march in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the compa ny reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of estimating incurred losses in determining the allowance for cr edit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at june approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approxima tely six years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at june march and january included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists changes in the forecasted economic assumptions from january to june primarily reflect the projected impact of the covid19 pandemic the assumptions utilized as of june reflected a longer period of economic recovery than previously assumed those assumptions included a decline in the unemployment rate in the third quarter of to approximately from a peak of nearly in the second quarter of followed by a sustained high singledigit unemployment rate through the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to contract nearly in and to then recover to prepandemic levels by the second quarter of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by in the first forecast year followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the forecast at march reflected a sharp contraction of economic activity in the second quarter of resulting in a projected unemployment rate of and an annualized rate of decrease in gross domestic product as low as with a decrease of during additionally commercial real estate prices were anticipated to decline by an average of in the first forecast year followed by improvement of in year the forecast utilized as of march contemplated a significant economic recovery beginning in the third quarter of the assumptions utilized as of january at the time of adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under and steady growth in gross domestic product of over the eight quarter forecast period forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near june march and january at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit loss es the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss esti mation process geopolitical conditions assessed at june and march included the potential impact of covid19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual ob ligations with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive outcomes on its allowance for credit losses ec onomic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of covid19 generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of positive change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at june appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at june and billion at march compared with billion on january when the new accounting pronouncement became effective the increases in the allowance for credit losses during the first and second quarters of were primarily the result of deteriorating forecasted economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at june and billion at december as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding the allowance was at june compared with at march at january as of june and at december excluding the impact of governmentguaranteed ppp loans originated by the company in the second quarter of the allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases at june was the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors previously referred to should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also

information concerning the companys fair valuations of investment securities is provided in notes and of notes to financial statements each reporting period the company reviews its availableforsale investment securities for declines in value that might be indicative of creditrelated losses through an analysis of the creditworthiness of the issuer or the credit performance of the underlying collateral supporting the bond if the company does not expect to recover the entire amortized cost basis of a debt security a credit loss is recognized and such loss would be recognized in the consolidated statement of income beginning january an allowance for credit losses would reduce the carrying value of availableforsale investment securities previously if a creditrelated loss was deemed to have occurred the investment securitys cost basis was adjusted as appropriate for the circumstances a loss is also recognized in the consolidated statement of income if the company intends to sell a bond or it more likely than not will be required to sell a bond before recovery of the amortized cost basis as of june based on a review of each of the securities in the availableforsale investment securities portfolio the company concluded that it expected to realize the amortized cost basis of each security as of june the company did not intend to sell nor is it anticipated that it would be required to sell any securities for which fair value was less than the amortized cost basis of the security the company intends to continue to closely monitor the performance of its securities because changes in their underlying credit performance or other events could cause the amortized cost basis of those securities to become uncollectible on january the company adopted amended accounting guidance that requires investment securities held to maturity to be presented at their net carrying value that is expected to be collected over their contractual term the company estimated no material allowance for credit losses for its investment securities classified as heldtomaturity at january march and june as the substantial majority of such investment securities were obligations backed by the us government or its agencies the company assessed the potential for expected credit losses on privately issued mortgagebacked securities in the heldtomaturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bondspecific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity these bondspecific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall securitization structure and the remaining subordination levels in total at june and december the company had in its heldtomaturity portfolio privately issued mortgagebacked securities with an amortized cost basis of million and million respectively and a fair value of million and million respectively at june of the mortgagebacked securities were in the most senior tranche of the securitization structure with being independently rated as investment grade the mortgagebacked securities are generally collateralized by residential and smallbalance commercial real estate loans originated between and and had a weightedaverage credit enhancement of at june calculated by dividing the remaining unpaid principal balance of bonds subordinate to the bonds owned by the company plus any overcollateralization remaining in the securitization structure by the remaining unpaid principal balance of all bonds in the securitization structure the weightedaverage default percentage and loss severity assumptions utilized in the companys internal modeling were and respectively given the securitization structure some of the bonds held by the company may defer interest payments in certain circumstances but after considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual senior and subordinate tranche bond the company has concluded that as of june it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of those privately issued mortgagebacked securities nevertheless it is possible that adverse changes in the estimated future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the companys conclusions adjustments to reflect the funded status of
