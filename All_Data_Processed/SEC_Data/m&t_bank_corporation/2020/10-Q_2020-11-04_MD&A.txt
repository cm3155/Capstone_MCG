item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview net income for mt bank corporation mt in the third quarter of was million compared with million in the corresponding quarter of and million in the second quarter of diluted and basic earnings per common share were in the recent quarter in the third quarter of and in the second quarter of net income totaled million or of diluted and basic earnings per common share during the first nine months of compared with billion or of diluted and basic earnings per common share in the similar period of the annualized rate of return on average total assets for mt and its consolidated subsidiaries the company in 2020s third quarter was compared with in the yearearlier quarter and in the second quarter of the annualized rate of return on average common shareholders equity was in the recent quarter in the third quarter of and in the second quarter during the ninemonth period ended september the annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders equity were and respectively compared with and respectively in the first nine months of effective january mt adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new accounting guidance replaced the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of january additional information on the new accounting guidance is provided under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements financial results for the first three quarters of have been adversely impacted by the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic large portions of the us economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and as a result many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted specifically those adverse economic impacts coupled with the accounting change noted previously resulted in the company recognizing significantly higher provisions for credit losses during the first three quarters of as compared with previous years the provision for credit losses in the recent quarter was million compared with million in the second quarter million in the first quarter of and million in the third quarter of for the ninemonth periods ended september and the provision totaled million and million respectively the periods reflect the new accounting guidance for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments prior to the provision for credit losses reflected incurred losses only in response to the pandemic the federal reserve has taken action to lower interest rates that has negatively affected the companys net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income totaled million and million in the third and second quarters of respectively compared with billion in the third quarter of for the first nine months of each year taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in and billion in on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law among other things the cares act provides relief to borrowers including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing and also provides funding opportunities for small businesses under the paycheck protection program ppp from approved small business administration sba lenders including mt bank for commercial and consumer customers the company has provided a host of relief options including loan maturity extensions payment deferrals fee waivers and low interest rate loan products mt bank funded ppp loans during that totaled billion at september updated economic forecasts at the end of each of the first three quarters of resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio than at january resulting in higher levels of the provision for credit losses in each of those quarters as compared with the comparable periods specifically for the third quarter of the level of the provision reflects the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors the uncertainty at september coming from washington dc over providing additional stimulus to the economy and concerns about ultimate collectibility of commercial real estate loans where the borrowers are requesting repayment forbearance the company expects that it will continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic after september and believes that the pandemic could have a material impact on its future financial results specifically the company expects the following balance sheet and income statement categories to be affected net interest income and net interest margin the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the companys net interest margin provision for credit losses although the economy has seen some signs of recovery during the recent quarter it is possible that deteriorating economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could result in continued higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses in addition the impact on borrowers ability to repay loans could be negatively affected potentially leading to increased chargeoffs significant portions of noninterest income could be adversely affected for example consumer deposit service charge fees may continue to be lower than historical levels due to lower customer transaction activity credit card interchange volumes may be lower than historical norms resulting in lower fees until the economy returns to prepandemic activity levels and portions of trust income may be reduced due to fee waivers associated with proprietary money market mutual fund management fees and a resurgence of the pandemic in large parts of the country may result in government mandates that could impact customer demand for many of the companys creditrelated products and other services the national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees the company has taken actions designed to help provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways examples of those actions include the deployment of a pandemic response plan to manage the pandemics effects on operations employees and customers including seeking to ensure employee safety maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers preserving the companys financial strength and complying with applicable laws and regulations actions have included placing restrictions on travel implementing social distancing health screening sanitation and other protocols and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home where possible the company continues to assess the appropriateness of employees returning to the office while seeking to ensure a safe work environment nearly all mt bank branches remain open with open lobbies and normal access to drivethrough windows and atms approximately of the companys nonbranch employees continue to work remotely while down significantly from june due to customers not requesting an extension of previously granted relief terms many loan customers are still receiving covid19 related relief in various forms including modification and forbearance requests as of september as follows commercial customers with balances of billion down from billion at june including loans to automobile and recreation finance dealers of million and billion at september and june respectively residential real estate customers with balances of billion excluding approximately customers with balances of billion that are serviced for others and therefore not included in the companys assets up from billion at june reflecting the impact of modified governmentguaranteed loans repurchased by the company from the portfolio of loans serviced for others and not previously included in the companys assets consumer including automobile recreational finance home equity lines and loans credit cards and personal loans customers with balances of million down from million at june paycheck protection program at september customers have outstanding loans totaling billion little changed from june and waiving certain types of transaction and maintenance fees for consumer and small business deposit account relationships notable events reflected in the companys financial results for the first nine months of included the following in july mt agreed to sell its noncontrolling interest in an asset manager obtained in the acquisition of wilmington trust corporation that had been accounted for using the equity method of accounting and as a result as of june recorded a million charge reflected in other costs of operations to reduce the carrying value of the investment to its net realizable value similar to other active investment managers the investee entity had experienced a decrease in assets under management and during the second quarter of the entitys chief executive and investment officer announced his retirement following that announcement successor management submitted a proposal to mt to restructure the organization of the entity the aftertax impact of the charge was a reduction in net income of million or of diluted earnings per common share in the second quarter of the sale of mts interest in the asset manager was effective september during the first quarter of the company increased its reserve for legal matters by million in conjunction with matters associated with a subsidiarys role as trustee of employee stock ownership plans in its institutional client services business that increase on an aftertax basis reduced net income in that quarter by million or of diluted earnings per common share also during that quarter mt realized million of distributed income from bayview lending group llc blg increasing net income by million or of diluted earnings per common share a similar distribution of million was received in the first quarter of increasing net income by million or of diluted earnings per common share supplemental reporting of nongaap results of operations mt consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and expenses associated with merging acquired operations when incurred into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income totaled million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share in the third quarters of and were and respectively net

provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter that decline resulted predominantly from an basis point hundredths of one percent narrowing of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the third quarter of the narrowing of the net interest margin was largely the result of declines in rates earned on loans and deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the federal reserve to decrease its target federal funds rate three times in the second half of each by a increment and twice in march of first by than another by the impact of the recent quarters lower net interest margin on net interest income was partially offset by an increase in average earning assets of billion from the yearearlier quarter the increase in average earning assets in the recent quarter as compared with the third quarter of resulted from higher average balances of loans and

than the billion averaged in the second quarter of for the first nine months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively as compared with the periods the lower average balances in the threemonth and ninemonth periods ended september reflect maturities of us treasury notes and pay downs of mortgagebacked securities the decline from the second to the third quarter of resulted from pay downs of mortgagebacked securities there were no significant sales of investment securities during the first nine months of or during the first quarter of the company purchased million of us treasury notes there were no other significant purchases of investment securities during the first nine months of or the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is predominantly comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities short term us treasury and federal agency notes and certain other debt and marketable equity securities investment securities also include capital stock of the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by factors such as demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet

equity securities were million in the recent quarter compared with million in the third quarter of and million in the second quarter net unrealized losses on equity securities were million during the first nine months of compared with net unrealized gains of million in the prior year period those gains and losses were predominantly related to the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the ninemonth periods ended september or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of september the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the

amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york the levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trustrelated deposits and other deposits of commercial entities purchases or maturities of investment securities or borrowings to manage the companys liquidity the higher amount at september and june as compared with the prior year period reflects the impact of increased commercial and consumer deposit balances agreements to resell securities averaged billion million and million during the quarters ended september september and june respectively the higher average balance in the recent quarter also reflects the impact of increased customer deposit levels as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first nine months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the similar quarter the increase in average core

associated with residential mortgage servicing activities average core deposits were billion in the second quarter of average savings and interestchecking core deposits increased billion or in the third quarter from billion in the immediately preceding quarter average noninterestbearing deposits in the recent quarter were billion or higher than the second quarter average of billion

ended september and june compared with billion for the quarter ended september the decreases in such deposits in the two most recent quarters as compared with the third quarter of reflect customer reaction to the declines in shortterm interest rates that followed actions by the federal reserve in march the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts which in the aggregate averaged billion during the recent quarter compared with billion in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of the amounts of cayman islands office deposits or brokered

second quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the narrowing of the net interest spread in the recent quarters as compared with the prior year period reflects the impact of the decreases in shortterm interest rates initiated by the federal reserve during the second half of and in march for the first nine months of the net interest spread was down basis points from in the yearearlier period the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities for the first nine months of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial nine months of net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter the increase in average net interestfree funds in the two most recent quarters as compared with the prior year period reflects higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits those deposits averaged billion billion and billion in the quarters ended september september and june respectively the rise in such balances in the most recent quarters as compared with the yearearlier period was largely due to increased levels of deposits of commercial customers during the first nine months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended september billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the threemonth period ended

the third quarter of and the second quarter of respectively the reduced contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the two most recent quarters as compared with the third quarter of reflects the lower rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds the contribution of net interestfree funds for the first nine months of and was and respectively reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the third quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period and in the second quarter of during the first nine months of and the net interest margin was and respectively future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion that were in effect at each of september september and december were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at september and billion at each of september and december were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company has entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the derivatives gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted for similar to that associated with fair value hedges the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended september september and june were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the weightedaverage rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were and respectively at september the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table additional

that were accounted for in the trading account rather than as hedging instruments but nevertheless provided the company with protection against the possibility of future declines in interest rates on earning assets at each of september and december outstanding notional amounts of such agreements totaled billion the interest rate floor agreements matured during the first quarter of as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ core deposits represent the most significant source of funding for the company and are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits cayman islands office deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at september and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively shortterm federal funds borrowings outstanding were billion at september there were no such borrowings outstanding at september or december in general those borrowings were unsecured matured on the next business day and were entered into for liquidity management purposes while predominantly used to satisfy customer demand cayman islands office deposits may also be used by the company as an alternative to shortterm borrowings cayman islands office deposits totaled million at september billion at september and billion at december the company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestbearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at september billion at september and billion at december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such impact by performing stress tests that assess the effect on liquidity resulting from various levels of internal and external stress factors the liquidity impact of such events is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on deposit levels available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not material at september or december the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at september compared with million at september and million at december mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at september approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at september and december were million and million respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at september and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at september the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates september december in thousands basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates has increased as of september as compared with december due to the lower interest rate environment and composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities in particular the increased balance of interestbearing deposits at banks changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account the fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements the amounts of gross and net trading account positions as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the company are subject to a welldefined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by mts board of directors however as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the companys trading account activities the notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled billion at september billion at september and billion at december the notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were million at september compared with million at september and billion at december although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the unsettled fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet were billion and million respectively at september and million and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at september have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively and at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the higher balance of trading account assets at september as compared with december was largely the result of increased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating million at each of september september and december changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income included in other liabilities in the

were assumed by the company in various acquisitions those assets totaled million at september and million at each of september and december given the companys policies limits and positions management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys trading account activities additional information about the companys use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note of notes to financial statements provision for credit losses as described in note of notes to financial statements effective january the company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses at january increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans reflecting the longerdated maturities of such portfolios were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan products due to the assumption that the company could require full repayment of such loans in the nearterm the following table depicts the changes in the allowance for credit losses by loan category resulting from the adoption of the amended guidance impact of adoption of amended accounting guidance on allowance for credit losses balance december impact of adoption increase decrease balance january in thousands commercial financial leasing etc commercial real estate residential real estate consumer unallocated total the amended guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to be reflected in the allowance for credit losses previously such losses were netted in the carrying value of the loans unless there was an increased loss expectation subsequent to their acquisition the grossup of the estimated losses on loans acquired at a discount that was previously not recognized in the allowance for credit losses was million on january prior to january the company generally recognized interest income on loans acquired at a discount regardless of the borrowers repayment status effective with the adoption of the new accounting guidance the companys nonaccrual loan policy now applies to loans acquired at a discount loans acquired at a discount at december included million of loans that effective with the adoption of the new guidance were classified as nonaccrual loans on january a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management the provision for credit losses in the third quarter of was million compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the second quarter of as noted earlier the significant increases in the provision in as compared with the third quarter of follow the adoption of new accounting guidance on january and reflect updated economic assumptions and projections that considered the macroeconomic outlook associated with the covid19 pandemic as of the end of each quarter of the companys estimates of expected losses reflect the ongoing impacts of the covid19 pandemic on economic activity generally and in the hospitality and retail sectors specifically the uncertainty in washington dc that existed at september over providing additional stimulus to the economy and concerns about commercial real estate values and the ultimate collectibility of commercial real estate loans where borrowers are requesting repayment forbearance net chargeoffs of loans were million in the recent quarter million in the third quarter of and million in the second quarter of net

purchased by the company the insurance or guarantee by the applicable governmentrelated entity remains in force the outstanding principal balances of the repurchased loans that are guaranteed by governmentrelated entities totaled million at september million a year earlier million at december and million at june the increase in such loans as compared with the prior dates resulted from higher levels of loans repurchased during the recent quarter the remaining accruing loans past due days or more not guaranteed by governmentrelated entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal in addition to the past due loans the company has also repurchased billion of government guaranteed residential mortgage loans in the recent quarter that are not considered delinquent because the borrower has requested and received a covid19 related payment deferral those loans were also repurchased to reduce associated servicing costs as described above and also remain covered by the insurance or guarantee of the applicable governmentrelated entity loans that were days past due were million at september compared with billion at december and million at june the lower levels of such past due loans at september and june were a result of loan paydowns many of which resulted in return to current status and migrations of loans to nonaccrual status covid19 related payment deferral modifications resulted in such loans being classified as current in accordance with regulatory guidance and as a result did not contribute in incremental additions to loans categorized as days past due prior to the adoption of the new accounting standard on january the company reported purchased impaired loans those loans were impaired at the date of acquisition were recorded at estimated fair value and were generally delinquent in payments but in accordance with gaap the company continued to accrue interest income on such loans based on the estimated expected cash flows associated with the loans the amended accounting guidance requires estimated credit losses on loans acquired at a discount to now be reflected in the allowance for credit losses and effective with the adoption of the guidance the companys nonaccrual loan policy now applies to such loans the carrying amount of purchased impaired loans was million at september and million at december the united states has been operating under a state of emergency related to the covid19 pandemic since march the direct and indirect effects of the covid19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations the cares act in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers created a forbearance program for federallybacked mortgage loans protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under gaap related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of covid19 the banking regulatory agencies have likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 that guidance with concurrence of the financial accounting standards board and provisions of the cares act allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief to not be treated as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings modifications may include payment deferrals fee waivers extensions of repayment terms or other delays in payment the company has worked with its customers affected by covid19 and as previously noted has granted a significant amount of modifications across many of its loan portfolios to the extent that such modifications met the criteria previously described such modifications have not been classified as delinquent or as troubled debt restructurings the company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the covid19 pandemic if the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted the company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments the objective of the modifications was to increase loan repayments by customers and thereby reduce net chargeoffs the modified loans are included in impaired loans for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses information about modifications of loans that are considered troubled debt restructurings is included in note of notes to financial statements residential real estate loans modified under specified loss mitigation programs prescribed by government guarantors that were not related to the covid19 pandemic have not been included in renegotiated loans because the loan guarantee remains in full force and accordingly the company has not granted a concession

the amount of current expected credit losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and leases portfolio a description of the methodologies used by the company to estimate its allowance for credit losses in can be found in note of notes to financial statements contained in this quarterly report on s at september approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at september approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately six years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at september june and january included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists changes in the forecasted economic assumptions from january to september primarily reflect the projected impact of the covid19 pandemic the assumptions utilized as of september included an increase in the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of to approximately from at the end of the third quarter of followed by a sustained high singledigit unemployment rate through the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to contract nearly in and to then recover to prepandemic levels by the third quarter of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the assumptions utilized at june include a decline in the unemployment rate in the third quarter of to approximately from a peak of nearly in the second quarter of followed by a sustained high singledigit unemployment rate through the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to contract nearly in and then to recover to prepandemic levels by the second quarter of residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the forecast at march reflected a sharp contraction of economic activity in the second quarter of resulting in a projected unemployment rate of and an annualized rate of decrease in gross domestic product as low as with a decrease of during the forecast utilized as of march contemplated a significant economic recovery beginning in the third quarter of the assumptions utilized as of january at the time of adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under and steady growth in gross domestic product of over the eight quarter forecast period forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near september june march and january at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process geopolitical conditions assessed at the end of each quarter in included the potential impact of covid19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual obligations with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive outcomes on its allowance for credit losses economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of covid19 generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at september appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at september compared with billion on january when the new accounting pronouncement became effective the increases in the allowance for credit losses during each of the quarters of were primarily the result of forecasted economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic and the expected impact of such conditions on borrowers abilities to repay loans the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at september and billion at december as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding the allowance was at september compared with at june at january and at each of september and december excluding the impact of billion of governmentguaranteed ppp loans originated by the company in the second quarter of the allowance as a percentage of total loans and leases at september was the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors previously referred to should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date other income other income totaled million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the second quarter of as compared with the third
