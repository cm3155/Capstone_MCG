item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mt bank corporation mt recorded net income in the first quarter of of million or of diluted earnings per common share compared with million or of diluted earnings per common share in the similar quarter during the final quarter of net income and diluted earnings per common share were million and respectively basic earnings per common share were in the recent quarter compared with and in the first and fourth quarters of respectively the annualized rate of return on average total assets for mt and its consolidated subsidiaries the company in the initial quarter of was compared with in the yearearlier quarter and in the final quarter of the annualized rate of return on average common shareholders equity was in the recent quarter compared with in the corresponding quarter and in 2019s the fourth quarter of effective january mt adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new accounting guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of january additional information on the new accounting guidance is provided under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements mts first quarter results were adversely impacted by the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic as the united states operates under a state of emergency economic forecasts of the impact of covid19 as of the end of the recent quarter resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in mts loan portfolio as compared with that estimated as of january while the full impact of covid19 on mts future financial results is uncertain and not currently estimable mt believes that impact could be material a provision for credit losses of million was recorded in the first quarter of on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law among other things the cares act provides relief to borrowers including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing and also provides funding opportunities for small businesses under the paycheck protection program ppp from approved small business administration sba lenders including mt bank which is one of the top ten sba lenders in the country for commercial and consumer customers mt has provided a host of relief options including loan maturity extensions payment deferrals fee waivers and low interest rate loan products on april mt provided an online application solution for small business customers and began accepting loan applications under the ppp while the updated economic forecasts at the end of the first quarter resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio resulting in a significant increase in the provision for credit losses the company will continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic after march the company believes that the covid19 pandemic could have a material impact on its future financial results specifically the company expects the following balance sheet and income statement categories to be affected average loan balances are expected to rise as commercial customers drew on available lines of credit in late march and as a result of the loans associated with the ppp being funded details of the main street lending program a provision of the cares act are being finalized so that potential impact is not determinable net interest income and net interest margin while the higher loan balances will add to net interest income the low interest rate environment and the rate earned on the ppp loans will negatively affect the companys net interest margin provision for credit losses deteriorating economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could result in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses than have been historically exper ienced in addition the impact on borrowers ability to repay loans could be negatively affected potentially leading to increased chargeoffs noninterest income will likely be lower as it relates to the trust businesses as some of that income is derived from equity market performance and it is likely that fee waivers will resume for proprietary money market mutual fund management fees the potential for a prolonged slowdown in debt capital market activities also exists consumer deposit service charge fees are expected to decline due to fee waivers and lower debit card transactions credit card interchange volumes are also expected to be lower resulting in lower fees residential mortgage applications are expected to continue to be strong given the low interest rate environment and the shelter in place and stay at home mandates around the country will impact aspects of the companys expense base such as the use of contractors travel and entertainment costs and other types of discretionary expenditures in addition the company has curtailed hiring and has redeployed employees to address the changing dynamics of the business given the current environment the national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a widespread and deep contraction of the economy challenging businesses and their employees the company has taken actions to provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways examples of those actions include the deployment of a pandemic response plan to manage the pandemics effects on operations employees and customers including seeking to ensure employee safety maintain continuity of operations and service levels for customers preserve the companys financial strength and comply with applicable laws and regulations actions have included placing restrictions on travel implementing a limited branch service model implementing social distancing requirements and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home indefinitely nearly all mt bank branches remain open with inperson visits by appointment and normal access to drivethrough windows and atms approximately of the companys nonbranch employees are working remotely loan customers are receiving covid19 related relief in various forms including modification and forebearance requests that have been approved through april as follows commercial customers with balances of billion residential real estate customers with balances of billion including customers with balances of billion that are serviced for others consumer including automobile recreational finance home equity lines and loans credit cards and personal loans customers with balances of million paycheck protection program through april customers were approved for loans totaling billion and waiving of certain types of transaction and maintenance fees for consumer and small business deposit account relationships during the first quarter of the company increased its reserve for legal matters by million in conjunction with matters associated with a subsidiarys role as trustee of employee stock ownership plans in its institutional client services business that increase on an aftertax basis reduced net income in that quarter by million or of diluted earnings per common share also during that quarter mt realized million of distributed income from bayview lending group llc blg increasing net income by million or of diluted earnings per common share a similar distribution of million was received in the first quarter of increasing net income by million or of diluted earnings per common share supplemental reporting of nongaap results of operations mt consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and expenses associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income aggregated million in the first three months of compared with million in the similar period diluted net operating earnings per common share for the first quarter of were compared with in the initial quarter net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were million and respectively in the fourth quarter of net operating income in the recent quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets was compared with and in the first and fourth quarters of respectively net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible common equity of in the recent quarter compared with in the yearearlier quarter and in the final quarter reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the initial quarter of compared with billion in the first quarter of that decline resulted predominantly from a basis point hundredths of one percent narrowing of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the corresponding quarter the narrowing in the net interest margin was largely the result of declines in rates on loans reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the federal reserve to decrease its target federal funds rate three times in the second half of each by a increment and twice in march of first by than another by the impact of the recent quarters lower net interest margin on net interest income was partially offset by an increase in average earning assets of billion from the yearearlier quarter reflecting growth in loans interestbearing deposits at banks and shortterm agreements to resell securities those increases were partially offset by a decline in average balances of investment securities taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter declined million or from the fourth quarter of primarily due to a billion or decrease in average earning assets the lower earning assets were predominantly due to declines in average balances of interestbearing deposits at banks and investment securities partially offset by a rise in average outstanding loans the recent quarters net interest margin was little changed from in the final quarter average loans and leases totaled billion in the recent quarter up billion or from billion in the first quarter of commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the first quarter of billion or higher than in the yearearlier quarter commercial loan and lease balances at march totaled billion up from billion a year earlier during late march the companys commercial customers began drawing on available lines of credit for liquidity purposes as the pandemic was expanding in scope those draws which totaled approximately billion are expected to have a more significant effect on average balances in the second quarter of to the extent such loans amounts remain outstanding average commercial real estate

loans automobile other total consumer total the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the first quarter of down billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter and million lower than the billion averaged in the fourth quarter of the lower average balances in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of reflect maturities of us treasury notes and pay downs of mortgagebacked securities during the first quarter of the company purchased million of us treasury notes there were no significant purchases of investment securities during the first quarter of or the fourth quarter of there were no significant sales of investment securities during the threemonth periods ended march march or december the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is predominantly comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities short term us treasury and federal agency notes and certain other debt and marketable equity securities investment securities also include capital stock of the federal home loan bank of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by factors such as demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities and other earning assets ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity a nd balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized losses on such equity securities during the first quarter of and final quarter of were million and million respectively compared with net unrealized gains of million during the first quarter of those gains and losses were predominantly related to the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the first quarters of or or in the final quarter based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of march the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities a further discussion of fair values of investment securities is included herein under the heading capital additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and other banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the recently completed quarter compared with billion in the first quarter of and billion in the final quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the threemonth periods ended march march and december respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york the levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trustrelated deposits of commercial entities purchases or maturities of investment securities or borrowings to manage the companys liquidity as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion and billion in the first and fourth quarter of respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the first quarter of billion or above billion in the yearearlier quarter average balances of savings and interestchecking core deposits rose billion or to billion in the initial quarter from billion in the yearearlier quarter that increase was predominantly due to higher residential mortgage escrow deposits resulting from additions to the companys servicing and subservicing portfolios in and higher commercial deposits average noninterestbearing deposits increased billion or to billion in the recent quarter from billion in the first quarter the recent quarter rise in average noninterestbearing deposits was largely due to higher trust and commercial deposits and mortgage escrow deposits as noted earlier in late march commercial customers drew down available lines of credit for liquidity purposes a large portion of those funds were deposited in customer deposit accounts at mt bank the impact of those additional deposits is expected to have a more significant effect on average deposit account balances in the second quarter of to the extent such amounts remain on deposit with the company average core deposits were billion in the fourth quarter of average savings and interestchecking core deposits declined million or in the initial quarter from billion in the immediately preceding quarter that decline reflected lower average commercial and mortgage escrow deposits average noninterestbearing deposits in the recent quarter were million or above the fourth quarter average of billion due to higher trustrelated deposits the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent increase decrease from 1st qtr 1st qtr 4th qtr in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over deposits associated with the companys cayman islands office and brokered deposits time deposits over excluding brokered deposits averaged million in the recent quarter compared with billion in the first quarter of and million in the final quarter the decreases in such deposits since the first quarter of were predominantly the result of maturities of higherrate time deposits cayman islands office deposits averaged billion in each of the first quarter of and the final quarter of compared with million in the initial quarter the increases in such deposits in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of were the result of customers desire to sweep their deposit balances into higher earning products however balances of cayman islands office deposits at march declined to billion from billion at december largely reflecting customer reaction to the declines in shortterm interest rates that followed actions by the federal reserve in march the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts which in the aggregate averaged billion during each of the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of and billion in the first quarter of the amounts of cayman islands office deposits or brokered deposits is largely dependent on demand by customers and other investors for those types of deposit products the table below summarizes average total deposits for the quart ers ended march december and march average deposits retail trust commercial and other total in millions three months ended march savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits deposits at cayman islands office total three months ended december savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits deposits at cayman islands office total three months ended march savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits deposits at cayman islands office total the company also uses borrowings from banks securities dealers various federal home loan banks the federal reserve bank of new york and others as sources of funding shortterm borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into had a contractual maturity of one year or less average shortterm borrowings totaled million in the initial quarter compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and million in the final quarter of shortterm borrowings from federal home loan banks averaged million in the first quarter of and million in the fourth quarter of there were no such borrowings outstanding in the initial quarter longterm borrowings averaged billion in the recent quarter compared with billion and billion in the first and fourth quarters of respectively average balances of outstanding senior notes were billion billion and billion during the three months ended march march and december respectively on january mt bank the principal bank subsidiary of mt redeemed million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on february also included in average longterm borrowings were amounts borrowed from the federal home loan banks of new york and pittsburgh of million in each of the two most recent quarters and million during the first quarter of subordinated capital notes included in longterm borrowings averaged billion in each of the threemonth periods ended march march and december junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million in each of the threemonth periods ended march and december and million during the initial three months of additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note of notes to financial statements longterm borrowings also included agreements to repurchase securities which averaged million in the first quarter of million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the fourth quarter of the repurchase agreement held at march totaled million and matures in july however the contractual maturities of the underlying securities extend beyond such repurchase date net interest income can be impacted by changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads net interest spread or the difference betwee n the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter compared with in the initial quarter the yield on earning assets during the first three months of was down basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities declined basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period the narrowing of the net inter est spread in the recent quarter as compared with the corresponding period reflects the decreases in shortterm interest rates initiated by the federal reserve during the second half of and to a lesser degree in march in the fourth quarte r of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the first three months of compared with billion in the initial quarter and billion in the fourth quarter of the increase in average net interestfree funds in the most recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of reflects higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits those deposits averaged billion billion and billion in the quarters ended march march and december respectively the rise in such balances in the recent quarter as compared with the initial quarter of was due to increased levels of deposits of commercial and trust customers partially offsetting the higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits in the initial quarter were increased average balances of mortgage servicing advances shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended march billion during the threemonth period ended march and billion during the threemonth period ended december goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in each of the two most recent quarters and the quarter ended march the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in each of the threemonth periods ended march march and december increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the first quarter of compared with and in the first quarter of and fourth quarter of respectively the reduced contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared with the first and fourth quarters of reflects the lower rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the first quarter of compared with in the similar period and in the fourth quarter of future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at march billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at march and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion that were in effect at each of march march and december were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans at march march and december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion billion and billion respectively were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company has entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the derivatives gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted for similar to that associated with fair value hedges the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended march march and december were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the weightedaverage rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were and respectively at march the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table additional information about the companys use of interest rate swap agreements and other derivatives is included in

or received on interest rate swap agreements in effect during the period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period in addition to interest rate swap agreements the company had entered into interest rate floor agreements that were accounted for in the trading account rather than as hedging instruments but nevertheless provided the company with protection against the possibility of future declines in interest rates on earning assets at each of march and december outstanding notional amounts of such agreements totaled billion the fair value of those interest rate floor agreements was million at march and thousand at december and was included in trading account assets in the consolidated balance sheet changes in the fair value of those agreements were recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income the interest rate floor agreements matured during the first quarter of as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ core deposits represent the most significant source of f unding for the company and are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nev ertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposit s with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits cayman islands office deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer uns ecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at march and december longterm borr owings aggregated billion and billion respectively shortterm federal funds borrowings outstanding at march were billion while there were no such borrowings outstanding at march or december in general those borrowings were unsecured matured on the next business day and were entered into to enhance the companys overall liquidity position at the time in addition to satisfying customer demand cayman islands office deposits may be used by the company as an alternative to shortterm borrowings cayman islands office deposits totaled billion at march billion at march and billion at december the company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestbearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at march and billion at each of march and december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not material at march or december the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at march compared with million at march and million at december mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payme nts related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guar antees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows fur ther discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at march approximately million was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at march and december were million and million respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at march and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet anticipated funding needs management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at march the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of march and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates march december in thousands basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain positive on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented herein under the heading capital and in notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account the fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements the amounts of gross and net trading account positions as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the company are subject to a welldefined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by mts board of directors however as with any

cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectibility of the reported amount the new guidance replaces the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses at january increases in the allowance for residential real estate loans and consumer loans reflecting the longerdated maturities of such portfolios were offset somewhat by net decreases in the allowance for commercial loans resulting from lower loss estimates on demand loan

from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under gaap related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of covid19 the banking regulatory agencies have likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 that guidance with concurrence of the financial accounting standards board and provisions of the cares act allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to

working with its customers affected by covid19 and expects a significant amount of modifications across many of its loan portfolios in the near term to the extent that such modifications meet the criteria previously described such modifications are not expected to be classified as troubled debt restructurings the company also modified the terms of select loans in an effort to assist borrowers that were not related to the covid19 pandemic if the borrower was experiencing financial difficulty and a concession was granted the company considered such modifications as troubled debt restructurings loan modifications included such actions as the extension of loan maturity dates and the lowering of interest rates and monthly payments the objective of the modifications was to

remaining contractual term of the loan and leases portfolio a description of the methodologies used by the company to estimate its allowance for credit losses in can be found in note of notes to financial statements contained in this quarterly report on s at march approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status at march the balance of junior lien loans and lines that were in nonac crual status solely as a result of first lien loan performance was million compared with million at march and million at december in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of estimating incurred losses in determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at march approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedav erage remaining draw periods were approximately six years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at march and january included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists changes in the forecasted economic assumptions from january to march primarily reflect the projected impact of the covid19 pandemic specifically the forecast at march reflected a sharp contraction of economic activity in the second quarter of resulting in a projected unemployment rate of and an annualized rate of decrease in real gross domestic product as low as additionally commercial real estate prices were anticipated to decline by an average of in the first forecast year followed by improvement of in year the forecast utilized as of march contemplated an economic recovery beginning in the third quarter of the assumptions utilized as of january at the time of adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under and steady growth in real gross domestic product of over the eight quarter forecast period forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near march and january at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process geopolitical conditions assessed at march included the potential impact of covid19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual obligations with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive ou tcomes on its allowance for credit losses economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of covid19 generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of positive change in real gross d omestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at march appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at march compared with billion on january when the new accounting pronouncement became effective the increase in the allowance for credit losses during the first quarter was primarily the result of deteriorated forecasted economic conditions as a result of the covid19 pandemic the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at march and billion at december as a percentage of loans and leases outstanding the allowance was at march compared with at january as of march and at december the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors previously referred to should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date other income other income

maturity to be presented at their net carrying value that is expected to be collected over their contractual term the company estimated no material allowance for credit losses for its investment securities classified as heldtomaturity at january and march as the substantial majority of such investment securities were obligations backed by the us government or its agencies the company assessed the potential for expected credit losses on privately issued mortgagebacked securities in the heldtomaturity portfolio by performing internal modeling to estimate bondspecific cash flows considering recent performance of the mortgage loan collateral and utilizing assumptions about future defaults and loss severity these bondspecific cash flows also reflect the placement of the bond in the overall

originated between and and had a weightedaverage credit enhancement of at march calculated by dividing the remaining unpaid principal balance of bonds subordinate to the bonds owned by the company plus any overcollateralization remaining in the securitization structure by the remaining unpaid principal balance of all bonds in the securitization structure the weightedaverage default percentage and loss severity assumptions utilized in the companys internal modeling were and respectively given the securitization structure some of the bonds held by the company may defer interest payments in certain circumstances but after considering the repayment structure and estimated future collateral cash flows of each individual senior and subordinate tranche bond the company has concluded that as of march it expected to recover the amortized cost basis of those privately issued mortgagebacked securities nevertheless it is possible that adverse changes in the estimated future performance of mortgage loan collateral underlying such securities could impact the companys conclusions adjustments to reflect the funded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans net of
