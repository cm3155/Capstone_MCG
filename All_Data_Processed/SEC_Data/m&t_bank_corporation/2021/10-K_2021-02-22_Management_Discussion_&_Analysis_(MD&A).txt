state of emergency related to the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic since march the direct and indirect effects of the covid19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in economic activity that severely hampered the ability for businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations the effects of the pandemic contributed to a significant increase in the companys provision for credit losses during the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act in addition to providing financial assistance to both businesses and consumers creates a forbearance program for federallybacked mortgage loans protects borrowers from negative credit reporting due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under gaap related to troubled debt restructurings to account for the effects of covid19 the bank regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 that guidance with concurrence of the financial accounting standards board and provisions of the cares act allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief to not be treated as troubled debt restructurings nor be reported as past due modifications may include payment deferrals including maturity extensions fee waivers and covenant waivers the company has been working with its customers affected by covid19 and has granted modifications across many of its loan portfolios to the extent that such modifications meet the criteria previously described the modified loans have not been classified as troubled debt restructurings nor reported as past due critical accounting estimates the companys significant accounting policies conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and are described in note of notes to financial statements in applying those accounting policies management of the company is required to exercise judgment in determining many of the methodologies assumptions and estimates to be utilized certain of the critical accounting estimates are more dependent on such judgment and in some cases may contribute to volatility in the companys reported financial performance should the assumptions and estimates used change over time due to changes in circumstances the more significant areas in which management of the company applies critical assumptions and estimates include the following table start accounting for credit losses effective january the company adopted amended accounting guidance that impacts how the allowance for credit losses is determined under the new accounting guidance the allowance for credit losses represents a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of certain financial assets including loans and leases to present the net amount expected to be collected at the balance sheet date a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management in estimating expected losses in the loan and lease portfolio borrowerspecific financial data and macroeconomic assumptions are utilized to project losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period for certain loan pools table end table start that share similar risk characteristics the company utilizes statistically developed models to estimate amounts and timing of expected future cash flows collateral values and other factors used to determine the borrowers abilities to repay obligations such models consider historical correlations of credit losses with various macroeconomic assumptions including unemployment gross domestic product and real estate prices these forecasts may be adjusted for inherent limitations or biases of the models subsequent to the forecast period the company utilizes longerterm historical loss experience to estimate losses over the remaining contractual life of the loans prior to the allowance for credit losses represented the amount that in managements judgment reflected incurred credit losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio as of the balance sheet date the estimation of the allowance for credit losses prior to did not consider reasonable and supportable forecasts that could have affected the collectability of the reported amounts changes in the circumstances considered when determining managements estimates and assumptions could result in changes in those estimates and assumptions which could result in adjustment of the allowance for credit losses in future periods a discussion of facts and circumstances considered by management in determining the allowance for credit losses as well as the new accounting guidance is included herein under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements table end table start valuation methodologies management of the company applies various valuation methodologies to assets and liabilities which often involve a significant degree of judgment particularly when liquid markets do not exist for the particular items being valued quoted market prices are referred to when estimating fair values for certain assets such as trading assets most investment securities and residential real estate loans held for sale and related commitments however for those items for which an observable liquid market does not exist management utilizes significant estimates and assumptions to value such items examples of these items include loans deposits borrowings goodwill core deposit and other intangible assets other assets and liabilities obtained or assumed in business combinations capitalized servicing assets pension and other postretirement benefit obligations estimated residual values of property associated with leases and certain derivative and other financial instruments these valuations require the use of various assumptions including among others discount rates rates of return on assets repayment rates cash flows default rates costs of servicing and liquidation values the use of different assumptions could produce significantly different results which could have material positive or negative effects on the companys results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information in addition to valuation the company must assess whether there are any declines in value below the carrying value of assets that require recognition of a loss in the consolidated statement of income examples include certain investments capitalized servicing assets goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets among others specific assumptions and estimates utilized by management are discussed in detail herein in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and in notes and of notes to financial statements table end table start commitments contingencies and offbalance sheet arrangements information regarding the companys commitments and contingencies including guarantees and contingent liabilities arising from litigation and their potential effects on the companys results of operations is included in note of notes to financial statements in addition the company is routinely subject to examinations from various governmental taxing authorities such examinations may result in challenges to the tax return treatment applied by the company to specific transactions management believes that the assumptions and judgment used to record taxrelated assets or liabilities have been appropriate should tax laws change or the tax authorities determine that managements assumptions were table end table start inappropriate the result and adjustments required could have a material effect on the companys results of operations information regarding the companys income taxes is presented in note of notes to financial statements the recognition or derecognition in the companys consolidated financial statements of assets and liabilities held by socalled variable interest entities is subject to the interpretation and application of complex accounting pronouncements or interpretations that require management to estimate and assess the relative significance of the companys financial interests in those entities and the degree to which the company can influence the most important activities of the entities information relating to the companys involvement in such entities and the accounting treatment afforded each such involvement is included in note of notes to financial statements table end overview net income recorded by the company in was billion or of diluted earnings per common share representing declines of and respectively from billion or of diluted earnings per common share in basic earnings per common share decreased to in from in net income in totaled billion while diluted and basic earnings per common share were and respectively expressed as a rate of return on average assets net income in was compared with in and in the return on average common shareholders equity was in in and in effective january mt adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments that guidance requires an allowance for credit losses to be deducted from the amortized cost basis of financial assets to present the net carrying value that is expected to be collected over the contractual term of the assets considering relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount the new accounting guidance replaced the previous incurred loss model for determining the allowance for credit losses the adoption of the amended guidance resulted in a million increase in the allowance for credit losses as of january additional information on the new accounting guidance is provided under the heading provision for credit losses and in note of notes to financial statements financial results for have been adversely impacted by the covid19 pandemic large portions of the us economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and as a result many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted specifically those adverse economic impacts coupled with the accounting change noted previously resulted in the company recognizing significantly higher provisions for credit losses during as compared with previous years for the years ended december and the provision for credit losses totaled million million and million respectively the period reflects the new accounting guidance for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial instruments prior to the provision for credit losses reflected incurred losses only in response to the pandemic the federal reserve has taken action to lower interest rates that has negatively affected the companys net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income totaled billion billion and billion in and respectively the cares act and applicable extensions provide relief to borrowers including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing and also provide funding opportunities for small businesses under the paycheck protection program ppp from approved small business administration sba lenders including mt bank for commercial and consumer customers the company has provided a host of relief options including payment deferrals including maturity extensions loan covenant waivers and low interest rate loan products mt bank funded approximately billion of ppp loans during of which billion remained outstanding at december updated economic forecasts at the end of each of the quarters of resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio than at january resulting in higher levels of the provision for credit losses in each of those quarters as compared with the comparable periods specifically the level of the provision in reflects the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors the uncertainty at december as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the us government to the economy and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where the borrowers are requesting repayment forbearance the company expects that it will continue to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic after december specifically the company expects that the following balance sheet and income statement categories could be affected net interest income and net interest margin the low interest rate environment will continue to negatively affect the companys net interest margin provision for credit losses although the economy has seen some signs of recovery it is possible that deteriorating economic assumptions used to calculate the allowance for credit losses at the end of future reporting periods could result in higher levels of the provision and allowance for credit losses in addition the impact on borrowers ability to repay loans could be negatively affected potentially leading to increased chargeoffs significant portions of noninterest income could be adversely affected for example consumer deposit service charge fees may continue to be lower than historical levels due to lower customer transaction activity credit card interchange volumes may be lower than historical norms resulting in lower fees until the economy returns to prepandemic activity levels and portions of trust income may be reduced due to fee waivers associated with proprietary money market mutual fund management fees and a resurgence of the pandemic in large parts of the country may result in government mandates that could impact customer demand for many of the companys creditrelated products and other services the national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees the company has taken actions designed to help provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways examples of those actions include the deployment of a pandemic response plan to manage the pandemics effects on operations employees and customers including seeking to ensure employee safety maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers preserving the companys financial strength and complying with applicable laws and regulations actions have included placing restrictions on travel implementing social distancing health screening sanitation and other protocols and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home where possible the company continues to assess the appropriateness of employees returning to the office while seeking to ensure a safe work environment nearly all mt bank branches remain open with open lobbies and normal access to drivethrough windows and atms the vast majority of the companys nonbranch employees continue to work

the sale of mts interest in the asset manager was effective september effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance for leases the new guidance requires lessees to record a rightofuse asset and a lease liability for all operating leases with a term greater than twelve months the accounting applied by lessors is largely unchanged however the guidance eliminates the accounting model

expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades and through the loss estimation modeling and other techniques used by the company are generally considered to possess lower expected losses when determining the allowance for credit losses loans with an elevated level of credit risk are classified as criticized and are ascribed higher expected loss amounts when determining the allowance for credit losses a criticized loan may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or

considering the credit worthiness of the borrower collateral values the financial condition of any guarantors and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments loantocollateral values on investorowned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse loans secured by residential real estate with a covid19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrowers ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values if collectability was considered doubtful loans were classified as nonaccrual loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the companys credit department personnel continuously review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions the company reassessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by covid19 in and expects that loans will continue to be regraded in subsequent periods as more information becomes available at least annually however updated financial

the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on

monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at december approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at december and january included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists changes in the forecasted economic assumptions from january to december primarily reflect the projected impact of the covid19 pandemic the assumptions utilized as of december included the national unemployment rate continuing at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual return to longterm historical averages by the end of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to grow at a annual rate during resulting in a return to prepandemic levels by the end of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the forecast considered approved government stimulus at the end of but not any further fiscal or monetary actions the assumptions utilized as of january at the time of adoption of the expected credit loss accounting standard were significantly less severe those assumptions anticipated unemployment rates that averaged under and steady growth in gross domestic product of over the eightquarter forecast period forecasted changes in real estate prices as of that date were not significant the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near december and january at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process geopolitical conditions assessed at the end of included the potential impact of covid19 on economic activity that could influence the

would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to hedge interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at december the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements information about interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes is included herein under the heading net interest incomelending and funding activities and in note of notes to financial statements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and non parallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes table displays as of december and the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year table sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates table start calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates december december in thousands basis points basis points basis points table end the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates increased as of december as compared with december due to the low interest rate environment and composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities in particular the increased balance of interestbearing deposits at banks table presents cumulative totals of net assets liabilities repricing on a contractual basis within the specified time frames as adjusted for the impact of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes management believes that this measure does not appropriately depict interest rate risk since changes in interest rates do not necessarily affect all categories of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities equally nor as assumed in the table on the contractual maturity or repricing date furthermore this static presentation of interest rate risk fails to consider the effect of ongoing lending and deposit gathering activities projected changes in balance

notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account the fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements the amounts of gross and net trading account positions as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the company are subject to
