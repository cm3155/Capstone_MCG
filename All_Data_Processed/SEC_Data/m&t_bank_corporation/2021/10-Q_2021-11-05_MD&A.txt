mergerrelated expenses during the annualized rate of return on average total assets for mt and its consolidated subsidiaries the company in the third quarter of was compared with in the third quarter of and in 2021s second quarter the annualized rate of return on average common shareholders equity was in the recent quarter in the yearearlier quarter and in the second quarter of during the ninemonth period ended september the annualized rates of return on average assets and average common shareholders equity were and respectively compared with and respectively in the similar period on february mt announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement with peoples united under which peoples united will be acquired by mt in an allstock transaction pursuant to the terms of the agreement peoples united shareholders will receive consideration valued at of an mt share in the form of mt common stock peoples united outstanding preferred stock will be converted to a new series of mt preferred stock upon completion of the acquisition the transaction is valued at approximately billion with the price based on mts closing price of per share as of september as of september peoples united reported billion of assets including billion of loans and billion of investment securities billion of liabilities including billion of deposits and billion of stockholders equity the merger has been approved by the common shareholders of mt and peoples united but remains subject to approval by the board of governors of the federal reserve system the merger is expected to be completed promptly after the parties have obtained that approval and satisfied other customary closing conditions financial results during and through the third quarter of were adversely impacted by the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic large portions of the us economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and as a result many commercial and consumer customers were negatively impacted specifically those adverse economic impacts resulted in the company recognizing elevated levels of provisions for credit losses during that reflected projections of credit losses based on macroeconomic forecasts at the end of each quarter of that year the company recorded provisions for credit losses of million and million in the three months and nine months ended september an improvement in economic conditions and forecasts at the end of each of the first three quarters of as compared with previous forecasts led the company to recognize provision recaptures of million and million in the three months and nine months ended september respectively in response to the pandemic the federal reserve took actions to lower interest rates that have negatively affected the companys net interest income since the beginning of the pandemic on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law the cares act and applicable extensions provide relief to borrowers including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing and also provided funding opportunities for small businesses under the paycheck protection program ppp from approved small business administration sba lenders including mt bank the principal bank subsidiary of mt for commercial and consumer customers the company provided a host of relief options including payment deferrals including maturity extensions loan covenant waivers and low interest rate loan products mt bank funded approximately billion of ppp loa ns during and another billion in ppp loans outstanding at september and december totaled billion and billion respectively updated economic forecasts at the end of each of the quarters of resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio than at january when the company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments resulting in historically high levels of the provision for credit losses specifically the level of the provision in reflected the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors the uncertainty at december as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the us government to the economy and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where borrowers requested repayment forbearance improvement in the economic outlook at the end of each of the first three quarters of resulted in reduced estimates of expected credit losses nevertheless concerns remain about large sectors of the economy including the hotel healthcare and office space sectors and possible threat of resurgence of spread of the covid19 virus the company expects that certain aspects of its businesses will continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic after september the national effort to mitigate the pandemic resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees the company took actions designed to help maintain a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways examples of those actions include the deployment of a pandemic response plan to manage the pandemics effects on operations employees and customers including seeking to ensure employee safety maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers preserving the companys financial strength and complying with applicable laws and regulations actions included placing restrictions on travel implementing social distancing health screening sanitation and other protocols and mandating for all employees whose jobs could be performed remotely to work from home where possible in accordance with changes in federal guidelines eg the centers for disease control and prevention and state and local regulations the company has begun to roll back certain of these measures the vast majority of the companys nonbranch employees continue to work remotely and the company is continuing to develop its future operating model eg onsite hybrid and remote in preparation for the eventual return of employees to the office mt bank branches remain open with open lobbies and normal access to drivethrough windows and atms and many loan customers are still receiving covid19 related relief in various forms including modification and forbearance requests as of september as described herein and in note of notes to financial statements supplemental reporting of nongaap results of operations mt consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and gains when realized and expenses when incurred associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income totaled million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the second quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share in the third quarters of and were and respectively and in the second quarter of for the first nine months of net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were billion and respectively compared with

with and respectively in the corresponding period reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter that improvement reflects lower rates paid on deposit accounts offset in part by the impact of lower average outstanding loan balances when compared with the third quarter of the results for the recent quarter reflected the impact of a billion or increase in average earning assets that was partially offset by a basis point hundredths of one percent narrowing of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earnings assets to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier quarter the higher average earning assets reflected growth in lowyielding balances at the federal reserve bank of new york partially offset by declines in average balances of loans investment securities and agreements to resell securities the narrowing of the net interest margin reflects the impact of the lowyielding balances at the federal reserve bank of new york constituting a higher percentage of average earning assets those balances add to net interest income but due to their low yield lower the reported net interest margin taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter increased million or from the second quarter of the higher net interest income was predominantly the result of increased yields on loans reflecting fees earned from payoffs of ppp loans the net interest margin in the third quarter of reflected a three basis point narrowing compared with the second quarter of that was attributable to billion of higher balances of lowyielding deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york offset in part by the higher loan yields in aggregate average earning assets in the recent quarter increased billion or approximately from the second quarter for the first nine months of taxableequivalent net interest income was billion up from billion in the corresponding period the increase was primarily attributable to a billion or increase in average earning assets partially offset by a basis point narrowing of the net interest margin to in the period from in the yearearlier period average loans and leases totaled billion in the third quarter of down billion or from billion in the similar quarter of commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the recent quarter billion or lower than in the yearearlier quarter that decline was largely the result of decreased average balances of ppp loans due to loan payoffs lower dealer floor plan balances reflecting automobile production and inventory issues experienced by the industry and subdued loan demand by commercial customers in general average commercial real estate loans were billion in the recent quarter up million or from

increased million from billion in the second quarter of commercial real estate loans held for sale averaged million in the second quarter of average balances of residential real estat e loans in the recently completed quarter declined million or from billion in 2021s second quarter largely reflecting the impact of loan repayments by customers and lower average balances of loans held for sale residential real estat e loans held for sale averaged million in the second quarter of average consumer loans in the recent quarter increased million or from billion in 2021s second quarter reflecting growth in recreational finance and automobil e loans the accompanying table summarizes quarterly changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio average loans and leases net of

billion in the yearearlier period loans are purchased to reduce associated servicing costs namely a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors including payments deferred under covid19 forbearance arrangements the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the third quarter of down billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter and million lower than the billion averaged in the second quarter of for the first nine months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively the lower average balances in the recent periods reflect net reductions of mortgagebacked securities due to paydowns partially offset by purchases during the three months and nine months ended september the company purchased million and billion respectively of fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities there were no significant purchases of investment securities during the first nine months of there were no significant sales of investment securities during the first nine months of or the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury and federal agency notes when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the co mpany may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfoli o in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized gains on such securities were less than million in the third quarter of and million in the yearearlier quarter compared with net unrealized losses of million in the second quarter of net unrealized losses for the first nine months of and were million and million respectively those gains and losses were predominantly related to the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the ninemonth periods ended september or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of september the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and other banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion for the three months ended september september and june respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york the levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trustrelated deposits of commercial entities purchases or maturities of investment securities or borrowings to manage the companys liquidity the higher balances in the two most recent quarters compared with the yearearlier period reflect increased commercial and consumer deposit balances agreements to resell securities averaged billion during the quarter ended september there were

compared with billion in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first nine months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the similar quarter and billion in the second quarter of the increase in average core deposits in the two most recent quarters as

deposits consisted predominantly of balances swept from loweryielding commercial customer accounts time deposits over excluding brokered deposits averaged million in the recent quarter compared with million in the third quarter of and million in the second quarter the decreases in such deposits since the third quarter of were predominantly the result of maturities of higherrate time deposits cayman islands office deposits averaged million for the quarter ended june and billion for the quarter ended september during the second quarter of the company introduced a new interestbearing sweep product included in savings and interestbearing deposits that replaced the eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as cayman islands office deposits as a result there were no outstanding deposits

as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income net interest spread or the difference between the taxable equivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter compared with in the third quarter

liabilities for the first nine months of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial nine months of net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter the increase in average net interestfree funds in the recent quarter as compared with those prior quarters reflects higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits during the first nine months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended september billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the second quarter goodwill and core deposit and other

in the third quarter of increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in each of the third and second quarters of compared with in the third quarter of the reduced contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the two most recent quarters as compared with the third quarter of reflects the lower rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree

as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the third quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period and in the second quarter of during the first nine months of and the net interest margin was and respectively future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at each of september and december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at september interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at each of september and december and billion at september were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company has entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of it s interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the derivatives gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted for similar to that associated with fair value hedges the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended september september and june were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the effective portion of cash flow hedges is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the weightedaverage rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were and respectively at september the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are

swap agreements in effect during the period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ab ility to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at september and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively prior to june cayman islands office deposits were used by some customers of the company as an alternative to other deposit and investment products cayman islands office deposits totaled million at september and million at december the company no longer offers deposits at the cayman islands office but as previously noted now offers an interestbearing sweep product to commercial customers through its domestic branches the company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestbearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at september billion at september and billion at december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not mat erial at september or december the total amount of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit was million at september compared with million at september and million at december mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at september approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at september and december were million and million respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at september and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at september the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and non parallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determi ne a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and d epositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has t aken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit prod ucts modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates september december in thousands basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and

losses over the remaining contractual term of the loan and lease portfolio a description of the methodologies used by the company to estimate its allowance for credit losses can be found in note of notes to financial statements in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses the company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by loan type despite recent improvements in macroeconomic forecasts at the time of the companys analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of september concerns existed about the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy the ultimate effectiveness of economic stimulus being provided by the us government that has contributed to increased deficit spending and raised inflation concerns disruptions to supply chains and the related impacts to businesses and consumers the volatile nature of global markets including the impact international economic conditions could have on the us economy federal reserve positioning of monetary policy the extent to which borrowers in particular commercial real estate borrowers may continue to be negatively affected by pandemicrelated and general economic conditions and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions approximately of the companys loans and leases are to customers in new york state and pennsylvania that could see lingering effects of the economic downturn the company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial lo ans and commercial real estate loans loans with a lower expectation of default are typically assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades while specific loans determined to have an elevated level of credit risk are classified as criticized a critici zed loan may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more during the latter half of and the first nine months of the company regraded significant portions of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans based on financial results and projections of specific borrowers particularly those that were affected by covid19 impacts criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled billion at september compared with billion at september billion at december and billion at june the rise in criticized loans at the two most rece nt quarterends as compared with december reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers financial condition and the continuing regrading of loans by the company and is reflective of the provision for credit losses recorded by the company in as the pandemic unfolded the increases in such loans since december were largely attributable to investorowned permanent commercial real estate loans in the hotel office and healthcare sectors and commercial real estate construction loans in the hotel and healthcare sectors on an overall basis weightedaverage loantostabilized value ltv ratios for investorowned commercial real estate properties do not vary significantly by asset class or sector and at september were gene rally within a range of to with an overall weightedaverage ltv ratio of approximately investorowned commercial real estate loans comprised billion of total criticized loans of billion at september the covid19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a significant reduction in economic activity that was detrimental to many borrowers across the companys geographic regions particularly borrowers in the hotel healthcarerelated and office sectors many of those borrowers have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic summaries of loans outstanding as of september for which borrowers have been granted a covid19 related forbearance and loans extended under the ppp are provided in the accompanying table of the covid19 related modifications with payment deferrals at september the vast majority are scheduled to expire during as commercial loans and commercial real estate loans were approved for modifications related to covid19 the company assessed loans considering the creditworthiness of the borrower collateral values the financial condition of any guarantors and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments loantocollateral values on investorowned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse loans secured by residential real estate with a covid19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrowers ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values if collectability was considered doubtful loans were classified as nonaccrual loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the companys credit department personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions the company reassessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by covid19 and expects that loans will continue to be regraded in subsequent periods as more information becomes available the companys policy is that at least annually updated financial information be obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis performed on a quarterly basis the companys centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing for criticized nonaccrual loans additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the

house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the companys residential real estate loans is located for residential real estaterelated loans including home equity loans and lines of credit the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is chargedoff when the loan becomes days delinquent that chargeoff is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net coll ateral value shortly after the company is notified of such filings at september approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio a pproximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior li en loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit f or charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are g enerally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at september approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the d raw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at september september and june included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists among the assumptions utilized as of september was that the national unemployment rate continues to be at elevated levels on average through the remainder of followed by a gradual improvement reaching within the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast assumed that gdp grows at an average annualized rate of during the eightquarter forecast period the commercial real estate price index was assumed to be down modestly in but improving in and residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the assumptions utilized as of june included the national unemployment rate continuing at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual improvement reaching by mid2023 that forecast assumed that gdp would grow at a annual rate during resulting in gdp returning to prepandemic levels during the commercial real estate price index was assumed to be down modestly in but improving in and residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the assumptions utilized as of december included the national unemployment rate continuing at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual return to longterm historical averages by the end of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to grow at a annual rate during resulting in a return to prepandemic levels by the end of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the assumptions utilized as of september included an increase in the unemployment rate in the fourth quarter of to approximately from at the end of the third quarter of followed by a sustained high singledigit unemployment rate through the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to contrac t nearly in and to then recover to prepandemic levels by the third quarter of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate signi ficantly the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near september june december and september at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dat es in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of covid19 generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at september appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at september billion at september billion at december and billion at june as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at each of september and june at december and at september the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level
