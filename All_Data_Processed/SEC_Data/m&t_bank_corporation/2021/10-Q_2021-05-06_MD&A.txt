approximately billion with the price based on mts closing price of per share as of march as of march peoples united reported billion of assets including billion of loans and billion of investment securities billion of liabilities including billion of deposits and billion of stockholders equity the merger is subject to a number of conditions including regulatory approvals and approval by common shareholders of mt and peoples united and is expected to be completed during the fourth quarter of financial results since the first quarter of were adversely impacted by the coronavirus disease covid19 pandemic large portions of the us economy were substantially curtailed for extended periods of time and as a result many commercial and consumer customers were adversely impacted specifically those adverse economic impacts resulted in the company recognizing elevated levels of provisions for credit losses during that reflected projections of credit losses based on macroeconomic forecasts at the end of each quarter of that year the company recorded provisions for credit losses of million in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter of an improvement in economic conditions and forecasts at march as compared with previous forecasts led the company to recognize a provision recapture of million in the first quarter of in response to the pandemic the federal reserve took actions to lower interest rates that have negatively affected the companys net interest income since the beginning of the pandemic taxableequivalent net interest income totaled million in the recent quarter and million and million in the first and fourth quarters of respectively on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act was signed into law the cares act and applicable extensions provide relief to borrowers including the opportunity to defer loan payments while not negatively affecting their credit standing and also provide funding opportunities for small businesses under the paycheck protection program ppp from approved small business administration sba lenders including mt bank the principal bank subsidiary of mt for commercial and consumer customers the company has provided a host of relief options including payment deferrals including maturity extensions loan covenant waivers and low interest rate loan products mt bank funded approximately billion of ppp loans during and another billion during the first quarter of ppp loans outstanding at march and december totaled billion and billion respectively updated economic forecasts at the end of each of the quarters of resulted in higher estimates of expected credit losses in the companys loan portfolio than at january when the company adopted amended accounting guidance for the measurement of credit losses on financial instruments resulting in historically high levels of the provision for credit losses specifically the level of the provision in reflected the ongoing impacts of the pandemic on economic activity in the hospitality and retail sectors the uncertainty at december as to the sufficiency and effectiveness of economic stimulus provided by the us government to the economy and concerns about ultimate collectability of real estate loans where borrowers requested repayment forbearance improvement in the economic outlook at march resulted in reduced estimates of expected credit losses however the company expects that it will continue to be negatively impacted by the covid19 pandemic after march the national effort to mitigate the pandemic has resulted in a challenging environment for businesses and their employees the company has taken actions designed to help provide a safe environment for its customers and employees and to provide relief to customers in a variety of ways examples of those actions include the deployment of a pandemic response plan to manage the pandemics effects on operations employees and customers including seeking to ensure employee safety maintaining continuity of operations and service levels for customers preserving the companys financial strength and complying with applicable laws and regulations actions have included placing restrictions on travel implementing social distancing health screening sanitation and other protocols and mandating for all employees whose jobs can be performed remotely to work from home where possible the company continues to assess the appropriateness of employees returning to the office while seeking to ensure a safe work environment nearly all mt bank branches remain open with open lobbies and normal access to drivethrough windows and atms the vast majority of the companys nonbranch employees continue to work remotely many loan customers are still receiving covid19 related relief in various forms including modification and forbearance requests as of march as described herein and in note of notes to financial statements supplemental reporting of nongaap results of operations mt consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and gains when realized and expenses when incurred associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income totaled million in the first quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share in the first quarters of and were and respectively net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were million and respectively in the fourth quarter of net operating income in the recent quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets was

yearearlier quarter and in the fourth quarter of reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was million in the first quarter of compared with million in the first quarter of that modest increase resulted from the impact of a billion or increase in average earning assets that was substantially offset by a basis point hundredths of one percent narrowing of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier quarter the higher average earning assets reflected growth in deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and loans partially offset by a decline in average investment securities balances the narrowing of the net interest margin was largely the result of declines in rates earned on loans and deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york reflecting the lower interest rate environment due to actions initiated by the federal reserve to decrease its target federal funds rate twice in march of first by than another by taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter declined million from the fourth quarter of reflecting the fewer number of days in the first quarter of a three basis point narrowing of the net interest margin in the recent quarter from in the prior quarter largely attributable to higher balances held in low yielding accounts at the federal reserve bank of new york was predominantly offset by a billion or rise in average earning assets average loans and leases totaled billion in the first quarter of up billion or from billion in the similar quarter of commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the first quarter of billion or higher than in the yearearlier quarter that increase was the result of average outstanding ppp loans of billion in the recent quarter that were

totaled billion in the recent quarter and billion in the last three quarters of also included in average residential real estate loans were loans held for sale of million in the recent quarter and million in the first quarter of consumer loans averaged billion in the first quarter of up billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter due to growth in average recreational finance loans consisting predominantly of loans secured by recreational vehicles and boats and to a lesser extent automobile loans that was partially offset by declines in outstanding balances of home equity loans and lines of credit average loan and lease balances in the first quarter of increased million from billion in the fourth quarter of commercial loan and lease average balances in the recent quarter were little changed from the fourth quarter of as higher loans to motor vehicle and recreational finance dealers were offset by lower average ppp loans average commercial real estate loans in the

billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter and million lower than the billion averaged in the fourth quarter of the lower average balance in the recent quarter as compared with the first and fourth quarters of predominantly reflects pay downs of mortgagebacked securities the company purchased million of fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities in march there were no other significant purchases and there were no significant sales of investment securities during threemonth periods ended march march or december the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury and federal agency notes when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized losses on such equity securities were million and million in the first quarters of and respectively compared with net unrealized gains of million in the final quarter of those gains and losses were predominantly related to the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the first quarters of or or in the final quarter based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of march the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and other banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the recently completed quarter compared with billion in the first quarter of and billion in the final quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the three months ended march march and december respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york the levels of those deposits often fluctuate due to changes in trustrelated deposits of commercial entities purchases or maturities of investment securities or borrowings to manage the companys liquidity the higher balances in the two most recent quarters compared with the yearearlier period reflect increased commercial and consumer deposit balances agreements to resell securities averaged million billion and billion for the quarters ended march march and december respectively as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion and billion in the first and fourth quarters of respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the first quarter of up from billion in the similar quarter the increase in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of reflected higher balances of noninterestbearing deposits and savings and interestchecking deposits average balances of savings and interestchecking core deposits rose billion or to billion in the first quarter from billion in the yearearlier quarter average noninterestbearing deposits increased billion or to billion in the recent quarter from billion in the first quarter those increases were largely due to higher average deposits of commercial customers but also reflect higher levels of consumer deposits and deposits associated with residential mortgage servicing activities average core deposits were billion in the fourth quarter of average savings and interestchecking core deposits increased billion or in the first quarter from billion in the immediately preceding quarter average noninterestbearing deposits in the recent quarter were billion or higher than the fourth quarter average of billion reflecting higher levels of liquidity being maintained by many commercial and

over deposits associated with the companys cayman islands office and brokered deposits time deposits over excluding brokered deposits averaged million in the recent quarter compared with million in the first quarter of and million in the fourth quarter the decreases in such deposits since the first quarter of were predominantly the result of maturities of higherrate time deposits cayman islands office deposits averaged million for the quarter ended march compared with billion for the quarter ended march and million for the quarter ended december the decreases in such deposits in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of reflect customer reaction to the declines in shortterm interest rates that followed actions by the federal reserve in march the company had

preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million million and million during the first quarters of and and the final quarter respectively additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note of notes to financial statements the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and longterm debt as of march interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter compared with in the initial quarter the yield on earning assets during the first three months of was down basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities declined basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the fourth quarter of the net interest spread was also the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the narrowing of the net interest spread in the two most recent quarters as compared with the initial quarter of period reflects the decreases in shortterm interest rates initiated by the federal reserve during march net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the first quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the fourth quarter the increase in average net interestfree funds in the two most recent quarters as compared with the initial quarter reflects higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended march billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the threemonth period ended december goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in each of the quarters noted herein the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in the threemonth period ended march and billion in each of the threemonth periods ended march and december increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the first quarter of compared with and in the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of respectively the reduced contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the two most recent quarters as compared with the first quarter of reflects the lower rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the first quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period and in the fourth quarter of future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in reductions in spreads could adversely impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at march billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at march and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at each of march and december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at march interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at each of march and december and billion at march were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate long term borrowings the company has entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the ineffective portion of the derivatives gain or loss on cash flow hedges is accounted for similar to that associated with fair value hedges the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended march march and december were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the effective portion of cash flow hedges is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the weightedaverage rates to be received and paid under interest rate swap agreements currently in effect were and respectively at march the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table additional information about the companys use of interest rate swap agreements and

liabilities b weightedaverage rate paid or received on interest rate swap agreements in effect during the period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at march and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively cayman islands office deposits have been used by some customers of the company as an alternative to other deposit and investment products cayman islands office deposits totaled million at march billion at march and million at december the company has also benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestbearing checking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at march billion at march and billion at december brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not material at march or december the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at each of march and december compared with million at march mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at march approximately million was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at march and december were million and million respectively junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at march and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at march the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of march and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates march december in thousands basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company engages in limited trading account activities to meet the financial needs of customers and to fund the companys obligations under certain deferred compensation plans financial instruments utilized for trading account activities consist predominantly of interest rate contracts such as interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with trading account activities by entering into offsetting trading positions that are also included in the trading account the fair values of trading account positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements the amounts of gross and net trading account positions as well as the type of trading account activities conducted by the company are subject to a welldefined series of potential loss exposure limits established by management and approved by mts board of directors however as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the companys trading account activities the notional amounts of interest rate contracts entered into for trading account purposes totaled billion at march billion at march and billion at december the notional amounts of foreign currency and other option and futures contracts entered into for trading account purposes were million at march compared with million at march and million at december although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the unsettled fair values of all financial instruments used for trading account activities are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the fair values of all trading account assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet were million and million respectively at march and billion and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at march have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively and at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the lower balance of trading account assets at march as compared with december was largely the result of decreased values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating million at march compared with million march and million december changes in the fair values of such assets are recorded as trading account and foreign exchange gains in the consolidated statement of income included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at each of march and december were million of liabilities related to deferred compensation plans compared with million at march changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the company was required to hold under terms of certain nonqualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the company in various acquisitions those assets totaled million at each of march march and december given the companys policies limits and positions management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading account activities was not material however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys trading account activities additional information about the companys use of derivative financial instruments in its trading account activities is included in note of notes to financial statements provision for credit losses a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance as deemed necessary by management a provision for credit losses recapture was recorded in the first quarter of for million compared with provisions of million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the fourth quarter of the provision recapture in the recent quarter reflects improvements in macroeconomic forecasts at march as compared with previous forecasts nevertheless the impact of those improvements was cautiously evaluated given the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy through the recent quarterend the level of the provisions in the quarters reflected projections of expected credit losses that were based on economic forecasts at those

due to loan accommodations related to the national emergency and provides financial institutions the option to temporarily suspend certain requirements under gaap related to troubled debt restructurings for a limited period of time to account for the effects of covid19 the banking regulatory agencies likewise issued guidance encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers who are or may be unable to meet their contractual payment obligations because of the effects of covid19 that guidance with concurrence of the financial accounting standards board and provisions of the cares act allow modifications made on a good faith basis in response to covid19 to borrowers who were generally current with their payments prior to any relief to not be treated as

term of the loan and lease portfolio a description of the methodologies used by the company to estimate its allowance for credit losses can be found in note of notes to financial statements in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company estimates losses attributable to specific troubled credits identified through both normal and targeted credit review processes and also estimates losses for other loans and leases with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis for purposes of determining the level of the allowance for credit losses the company evaluates its loan and lease portfolio by loan type at the time of the companys analysis regarding the determination of the allowance for credit losses as of march concerns existed about the somewhat uneven and incomplete recovery evident in the economy related to the covid19 pandemic despite recent improvements in macroeconomic forecasts the ultimate effectiveness of economic stimulus being provided by the us government the volatile nature of global markets including the impact international economic conditions could have on the us economy federal reserve positioning of monetary policy the extent to which additional repayment forbearance might be requested by borrowers in particular commercial real estate borrowers and continued stagnant population and economic growth in the upstate new york and central pennsylvania regions approximately of the companys loans and leases are to customers in new york state and pennsylvania that could see lingering effects of the economic downturn the company utilizes a loan grading system to differentiate risk amongst its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans loans with a lower expectation of default are assigned one of ten possible pass loan grades and through the loss estimation modeling and other techniques used by the company are generally considered to possess lower expected losses when determining the allowance for credit losses loans with an elevated level of credit risk are classified as criticized and are ascribed higher expected loss amounts when determining the allowance for credit losses a criticized loan may be classified as nonaccrual if the company no longer expects to collect all amounts according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or the loan is delinquent days or more during and the company regraded significant portions of its commercial loans and commercial real estate loans particularly those that were affected by covid19 impacts criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans totaled billion at march compared with billion at march and billion at december the rise in criticized loans at the two most recent quarterends as compared to march reflects the impact of the pandemic on borrowers financial condition and the continuing regrading of loans by the company the covid19 pandemic and related governmental responses led to a significant reduction in economic activity that has been detrimental to many borrowers across the companys geographic regions borrowers have been and will likely continue to be adversely impacted by the economic effects of the covid19 pandemic summaries of loans outstanding as of march for which borrowers have been granted a covid19 related forbearance and loans extended under the ppp are provided in the accompanying table of the covid19 related modifications with payment deferrals at march substantially all are scheduled to expire during as commercial loans and commercial real estate loans were approved for modifications related to covid19 loan officers and credit department personnel reviewed and reassigned loan grades as deemed appropriate the company assessed loans considering the creditworthiness of the borrower collateral values the financial condition of any guarantors and the expected collectability of contractual principal and interest payments loantocollateral values on investorowned loans are generally relatively low and oftentimes the loans include some form of recourse loans secured by residential real estate with a covid19 payment forbearance were evaluated for collectability based on the borrowers ability to repay considering past performance and estimated collateral values if collectability was considered doubtful loans were classified as nonaccrual loan officers in different geographic locations with the support of the companys credit department personnel review and reassign loan grades based on their detailed knowledge of individual borrowers and their judgment of the impact on such borrowers resulting from changing conditions in their respective regions the company reassessed its loan grades for those borrowers most impacted by covid19 in and expects that loans will continue to be regraded in subsequent periods as more information becomes available at least annually however updated financial information is obtained from commercial borrowers associated with pass grade loans and additional analysis is performed on a quarterly basis the companys centralized credit department reviews all criticized commercial loans and commercial real estate loans greater than million to determine the appropriateness of the assigned loan grade including whether the loan should be reported as accruing or nonaccruing for criticized nonaccrual loans additional meetings are held with loan officers and their managers workout specialists and senior management to discuss each of the relationships in analyzing criticized loans borrowerspecific information is reviewed

companys loss identification and estimation techniques make reference to loan performance and house price data in specific areas of the country where collateral securing the companys residential real estate loans is located for residential real estaterelated loans including home equity loans and lines of credit the excess of the loan balance over the net realizable value of the property collateralizing the loan is chargedoff when the loan becomes days delinquent that chargeoff is based on recent indications of value from external parties that are generally obtained shortly after a loan becomes nonaccrual loans to consumers that file for bankruptcy are generally charged off to estimated net collateral value shortly after the company is notified of such filings at march approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit of the remaining junior lien loans in the portfolio approximately or approximately of the aggregate home equity portfolio consisted of junior lien loans that were behind a first lien mortgage loan that was not owned or serviced by the company to the extent known by the company if a senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at march approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at march march and december included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists the assumptions utilized as of march included a decrease in the unemployment rate in the first quarter of to approximately from at the end of the fourth quarter of followed by a gradual decrease of the unemployment rate through the first quarter of to the forecast assumes that gdp grows at a annual rate during resulting in gdp returning to prepandemic levels during 2021the commercial real estate price index was assumed to be flat from prepandemic levels over the next two years residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the forecast considered approved government stimulus through march but not any further fiscal or monetary actions the assumptions utilized as of december included the national unemployment rate continuing at elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual return to longterm historical averages by the end of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product to grow at a annual rate during resulting in a return to prepandemic levels by the end of commercial real estate prices were assumed to decline by in followed by improvement residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the forecast considered approved government stimulus at the end of but not any further fiscal or monetary actions the forecast at march reflected a sharp contraction of economic activity in the second quarter of resulting in a projected unemployment rate of and an annualized rate of decrease in gross domestic product as low as the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near march december and march at the time it was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations changes in underwriting practices product expansions into new markets imprecision in its economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that influence its loss estimation process geopolitical conditions assessed at the end of the first quarter in included the potential impact of covid19 on economic activity that could influence the ability of customers to repay loan amounts in accordance with their contractual obligations with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period and of more negative or positive outcomes on its allowance for credit losses economic forecasts have changed rapidly in the recent past due to the uncertain impacts of covid19 generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices would have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and would likely result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at march appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at march compared with billion at march and billion at december as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at march at march and at december the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date other income other income totaled million in the first quarter of compared with million in the
