return on average assets and average common shareholders equity were and respectively compared with and respectively in the corresponding period of on april the company closed the acquisition of peoples united resulting in the issuance of common shares pursuant to the terms of the merger agreement peoples united shareholders received consideration valued at of an mt common share in exchange for each common share of peoples united the purchase price totaled approximately billion with the price based on mts closing price of per share as of april additionally peoples united outstanding preferred stock was converted into new shares of series h preferred stock of mt the peoples united transaction has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting and accordingly assets acquired liabilities assumed and consideration exchanged were recorded at estimated fair value on the acquisition date mt preliminarily recorded assets acquired of billion including billion of loans and leases and billion of investment securities and liabilities assumed totaling billion including billion of deposits the transaction added billion to mts common shareholders equity and million to preferred equity in connection with the acquisition the company recorded billion of goodwill and million of core deposit and other intangible assets the acquisition of peoples united formed a banking franchise with approximately billion in assets serving communities in the northeast and midatlantic from maine to virginia including washington dc mt completed the transfer of most financial records of peoples united to mts core operating systems in the recent quarter on july the companys board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to billion of mts common stock the action replaced the previous program under which the repurchases in the second quarter of were conducted in accordance with the program and its capital plan mt repurchased  of its common stock during the recent quarter at an average cost per share of resulting in a total cost of million during the first nine months of mt repurchased  of its common stock at an average cost per share of resulting in a total cost of billion supplemental reporting of nongaap results of operations mt consistently provides supplemental reporting of its results on a net operating or tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and gains when realized and expenses when incurred associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income totaled million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the second quarter diluted net operating earnings per common share in the third quarters of and were and respectively compared with in the second quarter of for the first nine months of net operating income and diluted net operating earnings per common share were billion and respectively compared with billion and respectively in the first nine months of net operating income in the recent quarter expressed as an annualized rate of return on average tangible assets was compared with in the third quarter of and in 2022s second quarter net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible common equity of in the third quarter of in the yearearlier quarter and in the second quarter of for the first nine months of net operating income represented an annualized return on average tangible assets and average tangible common shareholders equity of and respectively compared with and respectively in the corresponding period reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in the third quarter of higher than million recorded in the yearearlier quarter that increase reflects the impact of billion in additional average earning assets predominantly resulting from the peoples united transaction and a basis point hundredths of one percent expansion of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the third quarter of that increase resulted from higher yields on loans deposits at the federal reserve bank frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by a basis point increase in the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter increased million from the second quarter of reflecting an increase in the net interest margin in the recent quarter from in the prior quarter for the first nine months of taxableequivalent net interest income was billion up from billion in the corresponding period the increase was largely attributable to the higher level of earning assets including the impact of the peoples united transaction and a basis point widening of the net interest margin to in the period from in the yearearlier period the higher net interest margin in the recent periods is generally reflective of a rising interest rate environment resulting from actions taken by the federal reserve to raise interest rates in an attempt to temper inflationary pressures on the us economy average loans and leases totaled billion in the third quarter of up billion or from billion in the similar quarter of included in average loans and leases in the recent quarter were loans obtained in the peoples united acquisition loans acquired from peoples united totaled billion on the april acquisition date and consisted of approximately billion of commercial loans and leases billion of commercial real estate loans billion of residential real estate loans and billion of consumer loans including the impact of the acquired loan balances commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the recent quarter billion or higher than in the yearearlier quarter partially offsetting the increase from acquired loans was a reduction in average balances of paycheck protection program ppp loans reflecting loan repayments by the small business administration ppp loans averaged million in the third quarter of compared with billion in the third quarter of average commercial real estate loans were billion in the recent quarter up billion or from billion in the corresponding quarter of that increase was predominantly due to the impact of loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united partially offset by a reduction in balances of construction and permanent mortgage loans reflecting repayments by customers average residential real estate loans increased billion or to billion in the third quarter of from billion in the yearearlier quarter the growth in residential real estate loans was largely attributable to the acquisition of loans from peoples united and the companys decision in the third quarter of to retain rather than sell most originated residential mortgage loans consumer loans averaged billion in the third quarter of up billion or from billion in the yearearlier quarter reflecting the impact of loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united that consisted predominantly of outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit and growth in average recreational finance loans consisting predominantly of loans secured by recreational vehicles and boats average loan and lease balances in the third quarter of were billion little changed from billion in the second quarter of commercial loan and lease average balances in the recent quarter increased million from billion in the second quarter of average commercial real estate loans in the third quarter of declined million from billion in the second quarter of average balances of residential real estate loans in the recently completed quarter increased million from billion in 2022s second quarter average consumer loans in the recent quarter increased million from billion in 2022s second quarter the accompanying table summarizes quarterly changes in the major components of the loan and lease portfolio average loans and leases net of unearned discount percent increase decrease from third quarter third quarter second quarter in millions commercial financial etc real estate commercial real estate consumer consumer recreational finance automobile home equity lines and loans other total consumer total for the first nine months of average loans and leases totaled billion up from billion in the corresponding period the impact of loans obtained in the peoples united acquisition was the most significant factor for that increase offset in part by lower average balances of ppp loans of million and billion in the first nine months of and respectively the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the third quarter of up billion from billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion higher than the billion averaged in the second quarter of for the first nine months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively the higher average balance in the recent periods reflect the acquisition of peoples united which added approximately billion to the investment securities portfolio on april and purchases of approximately billion of investment securities during each of the quarters ended september june and march the purchases in the first nine months of consisted predominantly of us treasury notes and fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities there were no significant sales of investment securities during the first nine months of or the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york and the frb of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury notes and following the acquisition of peoples united municipal securities when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized losses on such equity securities were not significant in the third quarter of the second quarter of or the third quarter of net unrealized losses for the first nine months of and were million and million respectively those losses include changes in the value of the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the ninemonth periods ended september or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of september the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the investment securities portfolio is included in notes and of notes to financial statements other earning assets include interestbearing deposits at the frb of new york and other banks trading account assets federal funds sold and agreements to resell securities those other earning assets in the aggregate averaged billion in the recently completed quarter compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the three months ended september september and june respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the frb of new york the decline in the recent quarter reflects actions taken by the company including the purchases of investment securities and treasury stock and the management of select deposit relationships designed to reduce the balances of highercost deposit accounts in general the level of deposits held at the frb of new york also fluctuates due to changes in deposits of commercial entities trustrelated deposits and additions to or maturities of investment securities or borrowings as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion in the third quarter of and billion in the second quarter of average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first nine months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the third quarter of up from billion in the similar quarter but down from billion in the second quarter of the peoples united acquisition added approximately billion of core deposits on april including billion of savings and interestchecking deposits billion of time deposits and billion of noninterestbearing deposits the decline in average core deposits in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of is largely reflective of the companys initiative to reduce certain historically highercost deposits as well as customer reactions to the generally rising rate environment the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent increase decrease from third quarter third quarter second quarter in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over brokered deposits and prior to june deposits associated with the companys cayman islands office time deposits over averaged million in the recent quarter compared with million in the third quarter of and million in the second quarter of in the second quarter of the company introduced a new interestbearing sweep product included in savings and interestbearing deposits that replaced the eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as cayman islands office deposits as a result there are no longer deposits maintained at the cayman islands office and the office is closed the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts which in the aggregate averaged billion during each of the recent quarter and the third quarter of and billion during the second quarter of total uninsured deposits including deposits associated with the peoples united acquisition were estimated to be billion at september and billion at december the accompanying table summarizes average total deposits for the quarters ended september june and september average deposits retail trust commercial and other total in millions three months ended september savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total three months ended june savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total three months ended september savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also uses borrowings from banks securities dealers various federal home loan banks the frb of new york and others as sources of funding shortterm borrowings represent borrowing arrangements that at the time they were entered into or were assumed in an acquisition had a contractual maturity of one year or less average shortterm borrowings totaled million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of shortterm borrowings assumed in connection with the peoples united acquisition totaled million in october mt redeemed million of unsecured senior notes due to mature in december that had been assumed in the acquisition of peoples united and included in shortterm borrowings longterm borrowings averaged billion in each of the two most recent quarters compared with billion in the third quarter of average balances of the companys outstanding senior notes were billion during each of the three months ended september and june compared with billion in the third quarter of in august mt issued million of senior notes that mature in august and pay a fixed rate of semiannually until august after which the secured overnight financing rate sofr plus will be paid quarterly until maturity in april mt bank redeemed million of fixed rate senior notes that were due to mature on may during may million of variable rate senior notes of mt bank matured in january million of variable rate senior notes matured subordinated capital notes included in longterm borrowings averaged million in the third quarter of million in the threemonth period ended september and million in the second quarter of in march mt bank redeemed million of subordinated capital notes junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities that were included in average longterm borrowings were million million and million during the third quarters of and and the second quarter of respectively additional information regarding junior subordinated debentures is provided in note of notes to financial statements as of april longterm borrowings assumed in the peoples united acquisition totaled million and included million of fixedrate subordinated notes and million of fhlb advances the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and longterm debt as of september interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter up basis points from in the third quarter of the yield on earning assets during the third quarter of was up basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the second quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the increases in the net interest spread since the third quarter of reflect the impact of generally rising interest rates that resulted in higher yields on loans and leases deposits at the frb of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates on interestbearing liabilities for the first nine months of the net interest spread was up basis points from in the yearearlier period the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities for the first nine months of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial nine months of the federal reserve raised its target federal funds rate since september including hikes of and in the third quarter of and second quarter of respectively net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the third quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the second quarter of during the first nine months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively the increases in average net interestfree funds in the recent quarter and the second quarter of as compared with third quarter of reflect higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits and shareholders equity that include the impact of the acquisition of peoples united shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended september compared with billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the threemonth period ended june the higher amounts of shareholders equity in the two most recent quarters as compared with 2021s third quarter reflect retained earnings and additional equity issued in connection with the peoples united acquisition partially offset by share repurchase activity mt issued billion of common equity and million of preferred equity in completing the acquisition of peoples united on april mt also repurchased million of its common stock in each of the third and second quarters of goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion and billion in the third quarter of and second quarter of respectively up from billion in the third quarter of the company recorded billion of goodwill on april which represents excess consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in the peoples united transaction as part of the transaction intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value thereby increasing the balance of core deposit and other intangible assets on the companys balance sheet by million on april reflecting the impact of the peoples united acquisition the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in each of the third and second quarters of compared with billion in the third quarter of changes in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the third quarter of compared with and in the third quarter of and the second quarter of respectively the increased contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the most recent quarter as compared with the third quarter of and second quarter of reflects the higher rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the first nine months of and was and respectively reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the third quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period and in the second quarter of during the first nine months of and the net interest margin was and respectively future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in changes to spreads could impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin the federal open market committee has conducted a series of basis point increases in shortterm interest rates during the first nine months of these actions have led to generally higher interest rates overall and accordingly have contributed to the companys higher net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter and immediately preceding quarter management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at september and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at september interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at september and billion at december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at september and billion at each of september and december were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company enters into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended september september and june were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the valuation of cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table additional

computed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets or interestbearing liabilities b weightedaverage rate paid or received on interest rate swap agreements in effect during the period c excludes forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the frb of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at each of september and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion cayman islands office deposits had been used by some customers of the company as an alternative to other deposit and investment products during the second quarter of the company introduced a new interestbearing sweep product included in savings and interestchecking deposits that replaced the eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as cayman islands office deposits as a result the cayman islands office has been closed and there were no cayman islands office deposits outstanding as of september and december the company has benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestchecking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at september billion at december and billion at september brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not material at september or december the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at september million at december and million at september mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at september approximately million was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at september and december were billion and million respectively mt assumed million of shortterm borrowings and million of longterm borrowings in the acquisition of peoples united in october mt redeemed the shortterm borrowings obtained in the acquisition of peoples united junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at september and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at september the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of september and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates september december in thousands basis points basis points basis points basis points a a the company did not analyze this scenario as of december the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve changes in amounts presented since december reflect higher balances of earnings assets obtained in the peoples united acquisition changes in portfolio composition the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes a significant amount of the companys interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities preferred equity instruments and interest rate swap agreements have contractual repricing terms that reference the london interbank offered rate libor various regulatory bodies have encouraged banks to transition away from libor as soon as practicable generally cease entering new contracts that use libor as a reference rate no later than december and for new contracts entered into before december to utilize a reference rate other than libor or include robust language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after libors discontinuation publication of certain tenors of libor has already ceased and complete cessation of libor publication is expected by june effective december the company essentially discontinued entering into new liborbased contracts at september the company had liborbased commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans of billion and residential mortgage and consumer loans of billion outstanding approximately of the loans either mature before june or have been amended to include appropriate alternative language to be effective upon cessation of libor publication approximately million of borrowings and billion of preferred equity instruments reference libor as of september the companys interest rate swap agreements primarily reference libor in october the international swaps and derivatives association inc published the ibor fallbacks supplement supplement and the ibor fallback protocol protocol the protocol enables market participants to incorporate certain revisions into their legacy noncleared derivative trades with other counterparties that also choose to adhere to the protocol mt adhered to the protocol in november and is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap transactions with its enduser customers with respect to the companys cleared interest rate swap agreements that reference libor clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant secured overnight financing rate sofr benchmark alternatives of the supplement and protocol as loans mature and new originations occur a larger percentage of the companys variablerate loans are expected to reference sofr or other indexes including the bloomberg short term bank yield index bsby at september the company had approximately billion and million of outstanding loan balances that reference sofr and bsby respectively additionally as of september the company had billion of notional amount of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of commercial real estate loans including billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that become effective in and notional amounts of billion of nonhedging derivative interest rate contracts that are referenced to sofr the companys usage of interest rate swap agreements referenced to sofr or bsby is expected to increase in response to the discontinuation of libor the company continues to work with its customers and other counterparties to remediate liborbased agreements which expire after june by incorporating alternative language negotiating new agreements or other means the discontinuation of libor and uncertainty relating to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indexes to replace libor could materially impact the companys interest rate risk profile and its management thereof changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts to meet the financial needs of customers that it includes in its financial statements as nonhedging derivatives within other assets and other liabilities financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities by entering into offsetting positions with third parties that are also included in other assets and other liabilities the fair values of nonhedging derivative positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the companys nonhedging derivative activities although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the unsettled fair values of such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the fair values of such nonhedging derivative assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet were million and billion respectively at september and million and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at september have been reduced by contractual settlements of billion and million respectively and at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the values associated with the companys nonhedging derivative activities at september as compared with december reflect changes in values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments trading account assets were million at september million at december and million at september included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating

september and million at december changes in the balances of such liabilities due to the valuation of allocated investment options to which the liabilities are indexed are recorded in other costs of operations in the consolidated statement of income also included in trading account assets were investments in mutual funds and other assets that the company was required to hold under terms of certain nonqualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the company in various acquisitions those assets totaled million at september and million at each of september and december the increase at september as compared with the prior dates reflects assets obtained in the acquisition of the peoples united nonqualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans given the companys policies and positions management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading account and nonhedging derivative activities was not material however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys actions to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities additional information about the companys use of derivative financial instruments is included in note of notes to financial statements provision for credit losses a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance to reflect expected credit losses that are based on economic forecasts as of each reporting date provisions for credit losses of million and million were recorded in the third and second quarters of respectively compared with a credit loss recapture of million in the third quarter of the provision recorded in the second quarter of included million on loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united not deemed to be pcd gaap requires a provision for credit losses to be recorded beyond the recognition of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date in addition to the recorded provision the allowance for credit losses was also increased by million in the second quarter of to reflect the expected credit losses on loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united deemed to be pcd that addition represents an increase of the carrying values of loans identified as pcd at the time of the acquisition the companys estimates of expected credit losses at september reflect anticipated increases in unemployment spurred by federal reserve initiatives to curb high rates of inflation that could lead to overall deterioration of economic conditions and thus credit quality during an eightquarter forecast period risks considered included inflation a projected rise in unemployment reduction of economic growth projections decreasing residential real estate prices as compared with the immediately preceding quarter and continued concerns about commercial real estate values in the hospitality and office building sectors macroeconomic assumptions used to estimate credit losses on loans acquired from peoples united at the april acquisition date were

billion or at december and billion or at june loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united that have been classified as nonaccrual totaled million at september and million at june the level of nonaccrual loans reflects the continuing impact of economic conditions on borrowers abilities to make contractual payments on their loans most notably commercial real estate loans in the hospitality office retail and health carerelated sectors accruing loans past due days or more were million or of loans and leases at september compared with billion or at september million or at december and million or at june accruing loans past due days or more were predominantly residential real estate loans and included loans guaranteed by governmentrelated entities of million million million and million at september september december and june respectively the lower balance at september and june compared with the dates reflects residential real estate loans guaranteed by governmentrelated entities receiving payment deferrals during the covid19 pandemic but ineligible for treatment under the cares act that exited these arrangements and complied with modified terms to become current guaranteed loans included onetofour family residential mortgage loans serviced by the company that were purchased to reduce associated servicing costs including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors despite the loans being purchased by the company the insurance or guarantee by the applicable governmentrelated entity remains in force the outstanding principal balances of those purchased loans that are guaranteed by governmentrelated entities totaled million at september million a year earlier million at december and million at june the remaining accruing loans past due days or more not guaranteed by governmentrelated entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal the direct and indirect effects of the covid19 pandemic resulted in a dramatic reduction in in economic activity that severely hampered the ability of some businesses and consumers to meet their repayment obligations information regarding the companys treatment of loan modifications subject to applicable regulatory guidance issued during the pandemic including the cares act can be found in managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations within s at september approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit and were junior liens with respect to junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at september approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately five years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at september september and december included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists events posing emerging risks to the macroeconomic environment such as international conflicts and other events inflation and supply chain issues are considered when developing economic forecasts even if the events do not directly and materially impact the companys financial results supply chain disruptions inflationary pressures or other peripheral impacts of global events may alter economic forecasts and the company monitors this activity as part of its risk management procedures in assessing the allowance for credit losses among the assumptions utilized as of september was that the national unemployment rate will average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and residential real estate prices were assumed to contract over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period as of june the national unemployment rate was assumed to average through the reasonable and supportable period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable period at a average annual rate and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period as of december the forecast assumed that national unemployment would average through the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before gradually improving to in the latter half of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during at a average annual rate and during at a annual rate commercial and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period among the assumptions utilized as of september was that the national unemployment rate would continue to be at then elevated levels on average through the remainder of followed by a gradual improvement reaching within the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow at an average annualized rate of during the eightquarter forecast period the commercial real estate price index was assumed to be down modestly in but improving in and residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the assumptions utilized were based on the information available to the company at or near september june december and september at the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence the loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from forecasted events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses a potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages in the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts in the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before recovering to growth in the second year and commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively decline and respectively by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period a potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate declines to approximately for the duration of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows in the initial year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and in the second year while commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively rise and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario analyses resulted in an additional million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario a million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements management believes that the allowance for credit losses at september appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at september compared with billion at september billion at december and billion at june as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at september at september at december and at june using the same methodology described herein the company added million to the allowance for credit losses related to the billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of peoples united on april the combined company allowance for credit losses at april as a percentage of loans outstanding was the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at september and december was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses other income other income totaled million in the third quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter trust income service charges on deposit accounts and creditrelated fees all increased reflecting the acquisition of peoples united but were offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues resulting from the companys decision to retain the substantial majority of recently originated mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell such

real estate loanrelated fees and income were million in the third quarter of million in the similar quarter of and million in the second quarter of as compared with the third quarter of lower
