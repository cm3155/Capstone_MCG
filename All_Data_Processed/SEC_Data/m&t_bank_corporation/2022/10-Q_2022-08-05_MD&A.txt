existing contractual arrangements to purchase various services severance travel costs and an initial provision for credit losses on loans not deemed to be purchased credit deteriorated pcd on april gaap requires that acquired loans be recorded at estimated fair value which includes the use of interest rate and expected credit loss assumptions to forecast estimated cash flows gaap also provides that an allowance for credit losses on loans acquired but not classified as pcd also be recognized accordingly the company recorded a million provision related to such loans obtained in the peoples united transaction given the requirement to recognize such losses above and beyond the impact of forecasted losses used in determining the fair value of acquired loans the company considers that

tangible basis from which mt excludes the aftertax effect of amortization of core deposit and other intangible assets and the related goodwill core deposit intangible and other intangible asset balances net of applicable deferred tax amounts and gains when realized and expenses when incurred associated with merging acquired operations into the company since such items are considered by management to be nonoperating in nature although net operating income as defined by mt is not a gaap measure mts management believes that this information helps investors understand the effect of acquisition activity in reported results net operating income totaled million in the second quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter and million in the initial quarter diluted net

shareholders equity of and respectively compared with and respectively in the corresponding period reconciliations of gaap amounts with corresponding nongaap amounts are provided in table taxableequivalent net interest income taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in the second quarter of higher than million recorded in the yearearlier quarter that increase reflects the impact of billion in additional average earning assets predominantly resulting from the peoples united transaction which added billion to earning assets on april and a basis point hundredths of one percent expansion of the net interest margin or taxableequivalent net interest income expressed as an annualized percentage of average earning assets to in the recent quarter from in the second quarter of that increase resulted from higher yields on loans deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and investment securities partially offset by a basis point increase in the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities taxableequivalent net interest income in the recent quarter increased million from the first quarter of reflecting the increase in earning assets acquired in the peoples united transaction and an increase in the net interest margin in the recent quarter from in the prior quarter for the first six months of taxableequivalent net interest income was billion up from billion in the corresponding period the increase was primarily attributable to the higher level of earning assets resulting from the peoples united transaction partially offset by a one basis point narrowing of the net interest margin to in the period from in the yearearlier period average loans and leases totaled billion in the second quarter of up billion or from billion in the similar quarter of included in average loans and leases in the recent quarter were loans obtained in the peoples united acquisition loans acquired from peoples united totaled billion on the april acquisition date and consisted of approximately billion of commercial loans and leases billion of commercial real estate loans billion of residential real estate loans and billion of consumer loans including the impact of the acquired loan balances commercial loans and leases averaged billion in the recent quarter billion or higher than in the yearearlier quarter partially offsetting the increase from acquired loans was a reduction in average balances of paycheck protection program ppp loans reflecting loan repayments by the small business administration ppp loans averaged million in the second quarter of compared with billion in the second quarter of average commercial real estate loans were billion in the recent quarter up billion or from billion in the corresponding quarter of that increase was predominantly due to the impact of loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united partially offset by a reduction in balances of construction and permanent mortgage loans reflecting repayments by customers included in average commercial real estate loans in the second quarters of and were loans held for sale of million and million respectively average residential real estate loans increased billion or to billion in the second quarter of from billion in the yearearlier quarter included in average residential real estate loans were loans held for sale of million in the recent quarter and million in the second quarter of the growth in residential real estate loans was largely attributable to the acquisition of loans from peoples united and the companys decision in the third quarter of

estate commercial real estate consumer consumer recreational finance automobile home equity lines and loans other total consumer total for the first six months of average loans and leases totaled billion up from billion in the corresponding period loans obtained in the peoples united acquisition were the predominant factor for that increase offset by lower average balances of ppp loans those loans averaged million and billion in the first six months of and respectively the investment securities portfolio averaged billion in the second quarter of up billion from billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion higher than the billion averaged in the first quarter of for the first six months of and investment securities averaged billion and billion respectively the higher average balance in the recent periods reflect the acquisition of peoples united which added approximately billion to the investment securities portfolio on april and the purchase of billion of investment securities during each of the quarters ended march and june those purchases consisted of billion of us treasury notes and million of fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities there were no significant sales of investment securities during the first six months of or the company routinely has increases and decreases in its holdings of capital stock of the federal home loan bank fhlb of new york and the federal reserve bank of new york those holdings are accounted for at cost and are adjusted based on amounts of outstanding borrowings and available lines of credit with those entities the investment securities portfolio is largely comprised of residential mortgagebacked securities and shorterterm us treasury federal agency notes and following the acquisition of peoples united municipal securities when purchasing investment securities the company considers its liquidity position and its overall interestrate risk profile as well as the adequacy of expected returns relative to risks assumed including prepayments the company may occasionally sell investment securities as a result of changes in interest rates and spreads actual or anticipated prepayments credit risk associated with a particular security or as a result of restructuring its investment securities portfolio in connection with a business combination the amounts of investment securities held by the company are influenced by such factors as available yield in comparison with alternative investments demand for loans which generally yield more than investment securities ongoing repayments the levels of deposits and management of liquidity and balance sheet size and resulting capital ratios fair value changes in equity securities with readily determinable fair values are recognized in the consolidated statement of income net unrealized losses on such equity securities were less than million in each of the second quarter of and first quarter of compared with million in the second quarter of net unrealized losses for the first six months of and were million and million respectively those gains and losses include changes in the value of the companys holdings of fannie mae and freddie mac preferred stock the company regularly reviews its debt investment securities for declines in value below amortized cost that might be indicative of creditrelated losses in light of such reviews there were no creditrelated losses on debt investment securities recognized in either of the six month periods ended june or based on managements assessment of future cash flows associated with individual investment securities as of june the company did not expect to incur any material creditrelated losses in its portfolios of debt investment securities additional information about the

the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of interestbearing deposits at banks averaged billion billion and billion during the three months ended june june and march respectively the amounts of interestbearing deposits at banks at the respective dates were predominantly comprised of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york the peoples united acquisition resulted in an additional billion of interestbearing deposits at banks at april during the recent quarter the company purchased investment securities and actively managed higher cost deposit relationships in general the level of deposits held at the federal reserve bank of new york fluctuates due to changes in deposits of commercial entities trustrelated deposits and additions to or maturities of investment securities or borrowings as a result of the changes described herein average earning assets totaled billion in the most recent quarter compared with billion in the second quarter of and billion in the initial quarter average earning assets totaled billion and billion during the first six months of and respectively the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits the company considers noninterestbearing deposits interestbearing transaction accounts savings deposits and time deposits of or less as core deposits the companys branch network is its principal source of core deposits which generally carry lower interest rates than wholesale funds of comparable maturities average core deposits totaled billion in the second quarter of up from billion in the similar quarter and up from billion in the first quarter of the peoples united acquisition added approximately billion of core deposits on april including billion of savings and interestchecking deposits billion of time deposits and billion of noninterestbearing deposits core deposits obtained in the acquisition of peoples united averaged billion in the recent quarter excluding deposits obtained in that transaction average core deposits decreased billion from the second quarter of and billion from the first quarter of those declines and the lower levels of deposits obtained in the peoples united acquisition reflected lower average deposits of commercial and consumer customers the following table provides an analysis of quarterly changes in the components of average core deposits average core deposits percent increase decrease from second quarter second quarter first quarter in millions savings and interestchecking deposits time deposits noninterestbearing deposits total the company also receives funding from other deposit sources including branchrelated time deposits over brokered deposits and prior to june deposits associated with the companys cayman islands office time deposits over averaged million in the recent quarter compared with million in the second quarter of and million in the initial quarter cayman islands office deposits averaged million during the quarter ended june in the second quarter of the company introduced a new interestbearing sweep product included in savings and interestbearing deposits that replaced the eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as cayman islands office deposits as a result there are no longer deposits maintained at the cayman islands office and the office is closed the company had brokered savings and interestbearing transaction accounts which in the aggregate averaged billion during the recent quarter compared with billion in the second quarter of and billion during the first quarter of the increase from the first quarter of resulted predominantly from the addition of brokered deposits obtained in the peoples united acquisition total uninsured deposits including deposits associated with the peoples united acquisition were estimated to be billion at june and billion at december the accompanying table summarizes average total deposits for the quarters ended june march and june average deposits retail

financial statements as of april longterm borrowings assumed in the peoples united acquisition totaled million and included million of fixedrate subordinated notes and million of fhlb advances the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain components of its loans and longterm debt as of june interest rate swap agreements were used as fair value hedges of approximately billion of outstanding fixed rate longterm borrowings additionally interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of billion were used as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans further information on interest rate swap agreements is provided herein and in note of notes to financial statements changes in the composition of the companys earning assets and interestbearing liabilities as discussed herein as well as changes in interest rates and spreads can impact net interest income net interest spread or the difference between the taxableequivalent yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was in the recent quarter compared with in the second quarter of the yield on earning assets during the second quarter of was up basis points from in the similar period while the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities increased basis points to in the recent quarter from in the yearearlier period in the first quarter of the net interest spread was the yield on earning assets was and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities was the increase of the net interest spread in the recent quarter reflects the impact of generally rising interest rates that resulted in higher yields on loans and leases deposits at the federal reserve bank of new york and investment securities partially offset by higher rates on interestbearing liabilities for the first six months of the net interest spread was down basis points from in the yearearlier period the yield on earning assets and the rate paid on interestbearing liabilities for the first half of were and respectively compared with and respectively in the initial six months of net interestfree funds consist largely of noninterestbearing demand deposits and shareholders equity partially offset by bank owned life insurance and nonearning assets including goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets net interestfree funds averaged billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the yearearlier quarter and billion in the first quarter of during the first six months of and average net interestfree funds aggregated billion and billion respectively the increase in average net interestfree funds in the recent quarter as compared with the first quarter of and second quarter of reflects higher average balances of noninterestbearing deposits and shareholders equity that reflect the acquisition of peoples united shareholders equity averaged billion during the threemonth period ended june up from billion during the yearearlier period and billion during the threemonth period ended march the increase reflects retained earnings and additional equity issued in connection with the peoples united acquisition partially offset by share repurchase activity mt issued billion of common equity and million of preferred equity in completing the acquisition of peoples united on april mt also repurchased million of its common stock during the recent quarter goodwill and core deposit and other intangible assets averaged billion in the second quarter of up from billion in the immediately preceding and yearearlier quarters the company recorded billion of goodwill on april which represents excess consideration over the fair value of net assets acquired in the peoples united transaction as part of the transaction intangible assets were identified and recorded at fair value thereby increasing the balance of core deposit and other intangible assets on the companys balance sheet by million on april and million on average for the second quarter of the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance averaged billion in the second quarter of compared with billion in the threemonth period ended march and billion in the second quarter of increases in the cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance and benefits received are not included in interest income but rather are recorded in other revenues from operations the contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin was in the second quarter of compared with in each of the second quarter of and the first quarter of the increased contribution of net interestfree funds to net interest margin in the most recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of and first quarter of reflects the higher rates on interestbearing liabilities used to value net interestfree funds the contribution of net interestfree funds in the first half of and was and respectively reflecting the changes to the net interest spread and the contribution of net interestfree funds as described herein the companys net interest margin was in the second quarter of compared with in the yearearlier period and in the first quarter of yields on net earning assets obtained in the peoples united acquisition were estimated to have contributed basis points to the increase in the net interest margin in the second quarter of during the first six months of and the net interest margin was and respectively future changes in market interest rates or spreads as well as changes in the composition of the companys portfolios of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities that result in changes to spreads could impact the companys net interest income and net interest margin the federal open market committee has conducted a series of basis point increases in shortterm interest rates during the first half of these actions have led to generally higher interest rates overall and accordingly have contributed to the companys higher net interest margin in the recent quarter as compared with the yearearlier quarter and immediately preceding quarter management assesses the potential impact of future changes in interest rates and spreads by projecting net interest income under several interest rate scenarios in managing interest rate risk the company has utilized interest rate swap agreements to modify the repricing characteristics of certain portions of its earning assets and interestbearing liabilities periodic settlement amounts arising from these agreements are reflected in either the yields on earning assets or the rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes was billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at june billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at june and billion excluding billion of forwardstarting swap agreements at december under the terms of those interest rate swap agreements the company received payments based on the outstanding notional amount at fixed rates and made payments at variable rates at june interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion were serving as cash flow hedges of interest payments associated with variable rate commercial real estate loans compared with billion at june and billion at december interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts of billion at june and billion at each of june and december were serving as fair value hedges of fixed rate longterm borrowings the company has entered into forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements predominantly to extend the term of its interest rate swap agreements serving as cash flow hedges and provide a hedge against changing interest rates on certain of its variable rate loans in a fair value hedge the fair value of the derivative the interest rate swap agreement and changes in the fair value of the hedged item are recorded in the companys consolidated balance sheet with the corresponding gain or loss recognized in current earnings the difference between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items represents hedge ineffectiveness and is recorded as an adjustment to the interest income or interest expense of the respective hedged item in a cash flow hedge the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness recognized during each of the quarters ended june june and march were not material to the companys consolidated results of operations information regarding the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and hedge ineffectiveness is presented in note of notes to financial statements information regarding the valuation of cash flow hedges included in other comprehensive income is presented in note of notes to financial statements the changes in the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements and the hedged items primarily result from the effects of changing interest rates and spreads the average notional amounts of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes the related effect on net interest income and margin and the weightedaverage interest rates paid or received on those swap agreements are presented in the accompanying table additional information about

interest rate swap agreements not in effect during the period as a financial intermediary the company is exposed to various risks including liquidity and market risk liquidity refers to the companys ability to ensure that sufficient cash flow and liquid assets are available to satisfy current and future obligations including demands for loans and deposit withdrawals funding operating costs and other corporate purposes liquidity risk arises whenever the maturities of financial instruments included in assets and liabilities differ the most significant source of funding for the company is core deposits which are generated from a large base of consumer corporate and institutional customers that customer base has over the past several years become more geographically diverse as a result of expansion of the companys businesses nevertheless the company faces competition in offering products and services from a large array of financial market participants including banks thrifts mutual funds securities dealers and others the company supplements funding provided through deposits with various shortterm and longterm wholesale borrowings including overnight federal funds purchased shortterm advances from the fhlb of new york brokered deposits and longerterm borrowings mt bank has access to additional funding sources through borrowings from the fhlb of new york lines of credit with the federal reserve bank of new york mt banks bank note program and other available borrowing facilities the bank note program enables mt bank to offer unsecured senior and subordinated notes the company has from time to time also issued subordinated capital notes and junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities to provide liquidity and enhance regulatory capital ratios the companys junior subordinated debentures associated with trust preferred securities and other subordinated capital notes are considered tier capital and are includable in total regulatory capital at june and december longterm borrowings aggregated billion and billion respectively cayman islands office deposits had been used by some customers of the company as an alternative to other deposit and investment products during the second quarter of the company introduced a new interestbearing sweep product included in savings and interestchecking deposits that replaced the eurodollar sweep product previously recorded as cayman islands office deposits as a result the cayman islands office has been closed and there were no cayman islands office deposits outstanding as of june and december the company has benefited from the placement of brokered deposits the company had brokered savings and interestchecking deposit accounts which aggregated approximately billion at june billion at december and billion at june brokered time deposits were not a significant source of funding as of those dates the companys ability to obtain funding from these sources could be negatively impacted should the company experience a substantial deterioration in its financial condition or its debt ratings or should the availability of funding become restricted due to a disruption in the financial markets the company attempts to quantify such creditevent risk by modeling scenarios that estimate the liquidity impact resulting from a shortterm ratings downgrade over various grading levels such impact is estimated by attempting to measure the effect on available unsecured lines of credit available capacity from secured borrowing sources and securitizable assets in addition to deposits and borrowings other sources of liquidity include maturities of investment securities and other earning assets repayments of loans and investment securities and cash generated from operations such as fees collected for services certain customers of the company obtain financing through the issuance of variable rate demand bonds vrdbs the vrdbs are generally enhanced by letters of credit provided by mt bank mt bank oftentimes acts as remarketing agent for the vrdbs and at its discretion may from timetotime own some of the vrdbs while such instruments are remarketed when this occurs the vrdbs are classified as trading account assets in the companys consolidated balance sheet nevertheless mt bank is not contractually obligated to purchase the vrdbs the value of vrdbs in the companys trading account was not material at june or december the total amounts of vrdbs outstanding backed by mt bank letters of credit were million at june million at december and million at june mt bank also serves as remarketing agent for most of those bonds the company enters into contractual obligations in the normal course of business that require future cash payments such obligations include among others payments related to deposits borrowings leases and other contractual commitments offbalance sheet commitments to customers may impact liquidity including commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit financial guarantees and indemnification contracts and commitments to sell real estate loans because many of these commitments or contracts expire without being funded in whole or in part the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash flows further discussion of these commitments is provided in note of notes to financial statements mts primary source of funds to pay for operating expenses shareholder dividends and treasury stock repurchases has historically been the receipt of dividends from its bank subsidiaries which are subject to various regulatory limitations dividends from any bank subsidiary to mt are limited by the amount of earnings of the subsidiary in the current year and the two preceding years for purposes of that test at june approximately billion was available for payment of dividends to mt from bank subsidiaries mt also may obtain funding through longterm borrowings outstanding senior notes of mt at june and december were billion and million respectively mt assumed million of shortterm borrowings and million of longterm borrowings in the acquisition of peoples united junior subordinated debentures of mt associated with trust preferred securities outstanding at june and december totaled million and million respectively management closely monitors the companys liquidity position on an ongoing basis for compliance with internal policies and believes that available sources of liquidity are adequate to meet funding needs anticipated in the ordinary course of business management does not anticipate engaging in any activities either currently or in the longterm for which adequate funding would not be available and would therefore result in a significant strain on liquidity at either mt or its subsidiary banks market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in the market prices andor interest rates of the companys financial instruments the primary market risk the company is exposed to is interest rate risk interest rate risk arises from the companys core banking activities of lending and deposittaking because assets and liabilities reprice at different times and by different amounts as interest rates change as a result net interest income earned by the company is subject to the effects of changing interest rates the company measures interest rate risk by calculating the variability of net interest income in future periods under various interest rate scenarios using projected balances for earning assets interestbearing liabilities and derivatives used to manage interest rate risk managements philosophy toward interest rate risk management is to limit the variability of net interest income the balances of financial instruments used in the projections are based on expected growth from forecasted business opportunities anticipated prepayments of loans and investment securities and expected maturities of investment securities loans and deposits management uses a value of equity model to supplement the modeling technique described above those supplemental analyses are based on discounted cash flows associated with on and offbalance sheet financial instruments such analyses are modeled to reflect changes in interest rates and provide management with a longterm interest rate risk metric the company has entered into interest rate swap agreements to help manage exposure to interest rate risk at june the aggregate notional amount of interest rate swap agreements entered into for interest rate risk management purposes that were currently in effect was billion in addition the company has entered into billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements the companys assetliability committee which includes members of senior management monitors the sensitivity of the companys net interest income to changes in interest rates with the aid of a computer model that forecasts net interest income under different interest rate scenarios in modeling changing interest rates the company considers different yield curve shapes that consider both parallel that is simultaneous changes in interest rates at each point on the yield curve and nonparallel that is allowing interest rates at points on the yield curve to vary by different amounts shifts in the yield curve in utilizing the model marketimplied forward interest rates over the subsequent twelve months are generally used to determine a base interest rate scenario for the net interest income simulation that calculated base net interest income is then compared to the income calculated under the varying interest rate scenarios the model considers the impact of ongoing lending and depositgathering activities as well as interrelationships in the magnitude and timing of the repricing of financial instruments including the effect of changing interest rates on expected prepayments and maturities when deemed prudent management has taken actions to mitigate exposure to interest rate risk through the use of on or offbalance sheet financial instruments and intends to do so in the future possible actions include but are not limited to changes in the pricing of loan and deposit products modifying the composition of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities and adding to modifying or terminating existing interest rate swap agreements or other financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes the accompanying table as of june and december displays the estimated impact on net interest income in the base scenario described above resulting from parallel changes in interest rates across repricing categories during the first modeling year sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates calculated increase decrease in projected net interest income changes in interest rates june december in thousands basis points basis points basis points the company utilized many assumptions to calculate the impact that changes in interest rates may have on net interest income the more significant of those assumptions included the rate of prepayments of mortgagerelated assets cash flows from derivative and other financial instruments held for nontrading purposes loan and deposit volumes and pricing and deposit maturities in the scenarios presented the company also assumed gradual changes in interest rates during a twelvemonth period as compared with the base scenario in the declining rate scenario the rate changes may be limited to lesser amounts such that interest rates remain at or above zero on all points of the yield curve changes in amounts presented since december reflect higher balances of earnings assets obtained in the peoples united acquisition changes in portfolio composition the level of marketimplied forward interest rates and hedging actions taken by the company the assumptions used in interest rate sensitivity modeling are inherently uncertain and as a result the company cannot precisely predict the impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income actual results may differ significantly from those presented due to the timing magnitude and frequency of changes in interest rates and changes in market conditions and interest rate differentials spreads between maturityrepricing categories as well as any actions such as those previously described which management may take to counter such changes a significant amount of the companys interestearning assets interestbearing liabilities preferred equity instruments and interest rate swap agreements have contractual repricing terms that reference the london interbank offered rate libor various regulatory bodies have encouraged banks to transition away from libor as soon as practicable generally cease entering new contracts that use libor as a reference rate no later than december and for new contracts entered into before december to utilize a reference rate other than libor or include robust language that includes a clearly defined alternative reference rate after libors discontinuation publication of certain tenors of libor has already ceased and complete cessation of libor publication is expected by june effective december the company essentially discontinued entering into new liborbased contracts at june the company had liborbased commercial loans and leases and commercial real estate loans of billion and residential mortgage and consumer loans of billion outstanding approximately half of the loans either mature before june or have been amended to include appropriate alternative language to be effective upon cessation of libor publication approximately million of borrowings and billion of preferred equity instruments reference libor as of june the companys interest rate swap agreements primarily reference libor in october the international swaps and derivatives association inc published the ibor fallbacks supplement supplement and the ibor fallback protocol protocol the protocol enables market participants to incorporate certain revisions into their legacy noncleared derivative trades with other counterparties that also choose to adhere to the protocol mt adhered to the protocol in november and is in the process of remediating its interest rate swap transactions with its enduser customers with respect to the companys cleared interest rate swap agreements that reference libor clearinghouses have adopted the same relevant secured overnight financing rate sofr benchmark alternatives of the supplement and protocol as loans mature and new originations occur a larger percentage of the companys variablerate loans are expected to reference sofr or other indexes including the bloomberg short term bank yield index bsby at june the company had approximately billion and million of outstanding loan balances that reference sofr and bsby respectively additionally as of june the company had billion of notional amount of interest rate swap agreements designated as cash flow hedges of commercial real estate loans including billion of forwardstarting interest rate swap agreements that become effective in and and notional amounts of billion of nonhedging derivative interest rate contracts that are referenced to sofr the companys usage of interest rate swap agreements referenced to sofr or bsby is expected to increase in response to the discontinuation of libor the company continues to work with its customers and other counterparties to remediate liborbased agreements which expire after june by incorporating alternative language negotiating new agreements or other means the discontinuation of libor and uncertainty relating to the emergence of one or more alternative benchmark indexes to replace libor could materially impact the companys interest rate risk profile and its management thereof changes in fair value of the companys financial instruments can also result from a lack of trading activity for similar instruments in the financial markets that impact is most notable on the values assigned to some of the companys investment securities information about the fair valuation of investment securities is presented in notes and of notes to financial statements the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange contracts to meet the financial needs of customers that it includes in its financial statements as nonhedging derivatives within other assets and other liabilities financial instruments utilized for such activities consist predominantly of interest rate swap agreements and forward and futures contracts related to foreign currencies the company generally mitigates the foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities by entering into offsetting positions with third parties that are also included in other assets and other liabilities the fair values of nonhedging derivative positions associated with interest rate contracts and foreign currency and other option and futures contracts are presented in note of notes to financial statements as with any nongovernment guaranteed financial instrument the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to the companys nonhedging derivative activities although the notional amounts of these contracts are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the unsettled fair values of such financial instruments are recorded in the consolidated balance sheet the fair values of all nonhedging derivative assets and liabilities recognized on the balance sheet were million and million respectively at june and million and million respectively at december the fair value asset and liability amounts at june have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively and at december have been reduced by contractual settlements of million and million respectively the values associated with the companys nonhedging derivative activities at june as compared with december reflect changes in values associated with interest rate swap agreements entered into with commercial customers that are not subject to periodic variation margin settlement payments trading account assets were million at june and million at each of december and june included in trading account assets were assets related to deferred compensation plans aggregating million

retirement and other benefit plans that were assumed by the company in various acquisitions those assets totaled million at june and million at each of june and december the increase at june as compared with the prior dates resulted from the acquisition of the peoples united nonqualified supplemental retirement and other benefit plans given the companys policies and positions management believes that the potential loss exposure to the company resulting from market risk associated with trading account and nonhedging derivative activities was not material however as previously noted the company is exposed to credit risk associated with counterparties to transactions related to the companys actions to mitigate foreign currency and interest rate risk associated with customer activities additional information about the companys use of derivative financial instruments is included in note of notes to financial statements provision for credit losses a provision for credit losses is recorded to adjust the level of the allowance to reflect expected credit losses that are based on economic forecasts as of each reporting date provisions for credit losses of million and million were recorded in the second and first quarters of respectively compared with a credit loss recapture of million in the second quarter of the provision recorded in the most recent quarter includes million on loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united not deemed to be pcd gaap requires a provision for credit losses to be recorded beyond the recognition of the fair value of the loans at the acquisition date in addition to the recorded provision the allowance for credit losses was also increased by million to reflect the expected credit losses on loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united deemed to be pcd that addition represents an increase of the carrying values of loans identified as pcd at the time of the acquisition the companys estimates of expected credit losses at june reflect low unemployment and stable to improving credit quality but consider risks associated with rising inflation including a slight reduction of economic growth projections as compared with the immediately preceding quarter and continued concerns about commercial real estate values in the hospitality and office building sectors macroeconomic assumptions used to estimate credit losses on loans acquired from peoples united at the april acquisition date were consistent with those used by the company to estimate credit losses at march as described herein net chargeoffs

june compared with billion or at june billion or at december and billion or at march loans obtained in the acquisition of peoples united that have been classified as nonaccrual at june totaled million the level of nonaccrual loans reflects the continuing impact of economic conditions on borrowers abilities to make contractual payments on their loans most notably commercial real estate loans in the hospitality office retail and health carerelated sectors accruing loans past due days or more were million or of loans and leases at june compared with billion or at june million or at december and million or at march accruing loans past due days or more were predominantly residential real estate loans and included loans guaranteed by governmentrelated entities of million billion million and million at june june december and march respectively guaranteed loans included onetofour family residential mortgage loans serviced by the company that were purchased to reduce associated servicing costs including a requirement to advance principal and interest payments that had not been received from individual mortgagors despite the loans being purchased by the company the insurance or guarantee by the applicable governmentrelated entity remains in force the outstanding principal balances of those purchased loans that are guaranteed by governmentrelated entities totaled million at june billion a year earlier million at december and million at march the remaining accruing loans past due days or more not guaranteed by governmentrelated entities were loans considered to be with creditworthy borrowers that were in the process of collection or renewal in addition to the past due loans the company also has million of governmentguaranteed residential mortgage loans that are not considered delinquent because the borrower has requested and received a covid19 related payment deferral in general those loans were also purchased to reduce associated servicing costs as described above and also remain covered by the insurance or guarantee of the applicable governmentrelated entity but are not considered to be past due in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as described in note of notes to financial statements in mts s at june approximately of the companys home equity portfolio consisted of first lien loans and lines of credit and were junior liens with respect to junior lien loans to the extent known by the company if a related senior lien loan would be on nonaccrual status because of payment delinquency even if such senior lien loan was not owned by the company the junior lien loan or line that is owned by the company is placed on nonaccrual status in monitoring the credit quality of its home equity portfolio for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company reviews delinquency and nonaccrual information and considers recent chargeoff experience when evaluating individual home equity loans and lines of credit for charge off and for purposes of determining the allowance for credit losses the company gives consideration to the required repayment of any first lien positions related to collateral property home equity line of credit terms vary but such lines are generally originated with an open draw period of ten years followed by an amortization period of up to twenty years at june approximately of all outstanding balances of home equity lines of credit related to lines that were still in the draw period the weightedaverage remaining draw periods were approximately seven years and approximately were making contractually allowed payments that do not include any repayment of principal factors that influence the companys credit loss experience include overall economic conditions affecting businesses and consumers generally but also residential and commercial real estate valuations in particular given the size of the companys real estate loan portfolios commercial real estate valuations can be highly subjective as they are based upon many assumptions such valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property similarly residential real estate valuations can be impacted by housing trends the availability of financing at reasonable interest rates and general economic conditions affecting consumers the company generally estimates current expected credit losses on loans with similar risk characteristics on a collective basis to estimate expected losses the company utilizes statistically developed models to project principal balances over the remaining contractual lives of the loan portfolios and determine estimated credit losses through a reasonable and supportable forecast period the companys approach for estimating current expected credit losses for loans and leases at june june and december included utilizing macroeconomic assumptions to project losses over a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period subsequent to the forecast period the company reverted to longerterm historical loss experience over a period of one year to estimate expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life forwardlooking estimates of certain macroeconomic variables are determined by the mt scenario development group which is comprised of senior management business leaders and economists events posing emerging risks to the macroeconomic environment such as the war in ukraine inflation and supply chain issues are considered when developing economic forecasts even if the events do not directly and materially impact the companys financial results supply chain disruptions inflationary pressures or other peripheral impacts of global events may alter economic forecasts and the company monitors this activity as part of its risk management procedures in assessing the allowance for credit losses among the assumptions utilized as of june was that the national unemployment rate will average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product grows at a average rate during the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period and at a average rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period as of march the national unemployment rate was assumed to average through the reasonable and supportable forecast period the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during the first year of the reasonable and supportable period at a average annual rate and a average rate in the second year commercial real estate and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period as of december the forecast assumed that national unemployment would average through the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before gradually improving to in the latter half of the forecast also assumed gross domestic product would grow during at a average annual rate and during at a annual rate commercial and residential real estate prices were assumed to cumulatively grow and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period among the assumptions utilized as of june was that the national unemployment rate would continue to be at then elevated levels on average through followed by a gradual improvement reaching by mid2023 the forecast assumed that gdp would grow at a annual rate during resulting in gdp returning to prepandemic levels during the commercial real estate price index was assumed to be down modestly in but improving in and residential real estate prices were not assumed to fluctuate significantly the assumptions utilized were based on information available to the company at or near june march december and june at the time the company was preparing its estimate of expected credit losses as of those dates in establishing the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the impact of portfolio concentrations imprecision in economic forecasts geopolitical conditions and other risk factors that might influence the loss estimation process with respect to economic forecasts the company assessed the likelihood of alternative economic scenarios during the twoyear reasonable and supportable time period generally an increase in unemployment rate or a decrease in any of the rate of change in gross domestic product commercial real estate prices or home prices could have an adverse impact on expected credit losses and may result in an increase to the allowance for credit losses forward looking economic forecasts are subject to inherent imprecision and future events may differ materially from actual events in consideration of such uncertainty the following alternative economic scenarios were considered to estimate the possible impact on modeled credit losses a potential downside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate averages in the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumed gross domestic product contracts in the first year of the reasonable and supportable forecast period before recovering to growth in the second year and commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively decline and respectively by the end of the reasonable and supportable forecast period a potential upside economic scenario assumed the unemployment rate declines to approximately for the duration of the reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario also assumes gross domestic product grows in the initial year of the reasonable and forecast period and in the second year while commercial real estate and residential real estate prices cumulatively rise and respectively over the twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period the scenario analyses resulted in an additional million of modeled credit losses under the assumptions of the downside economic scenario whereas under the assumptions of the upside economic scenario an million reduction in modeled credit losses could occur these examples are only a few of the numerous possible economic scenarios that could be utilized in assessing the sensitivity of expected credit losses the estimated impacts on credit losses in such scenarios pertain only to modeled credit losses and do not include consideration of other factors the company may evaluate when determining its allowance for credit losses as a result it is possible that the company may at another point in time reach different conclusions regarding credit loss estimates the companys process for determining the allowance for credit losses undergoes quarterly and periodic evaluations by independent risk management personnel which among many other considerations evaluate the reasonableness of managements methodology and significant assumptions further information about the companys methodology to estimate expected credit losses is included in note of notes to financial statements using the same methodology and macroeconomic assumptions described herein the company added million to the allowance for credit losses related to the billion of loans and leases obtained in the acquisition of peoples united the combined company allowance for credit losses at april as a percentage of loans outstanding was the company evaluated the allowance for credit losses at june for those loans in addition the companys remaining loans and leases outstanding management believes that the allowance for credit losses at june appropriately reflected expected credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of that date the allowance for credit losses totaled billion at june compared with billion at june and billion at each of december and march as a percentage of loans outstanding the allowance was at june at june at december and at march the level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio using the methodology and considering the factors as described herein should the various economic forecasts and credit factors considered by management in establishing the allowance for credit losses change and should managements assessment of losses in the loan portfolio also change the level of the allowance as a percentage of loans could increase or decrease in future periods the reported level of the allowance reflects managements evaluation of the loan and lease portfolio as of each respective date the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to total nonaccrual loans at june and december was and respectively given the companys general position as a secured lender and its practice of charging off loan balances when collection is deemed doubtful that ratio and changes in the ratio are generally not an indicative measure of the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses nor does management rely upon that ratio in assessing the adequacy of the companys allowance for credit losses other income other income totaled million in the second quarter of compared with million in the yearearlier quarter other income attributable to the peoples united acquisition was approximately million in the recent quarter as compared with the second quarter of the higher other income in the recent quarter was predominantly from peoples unitedrelated revenues but also included higher trust and brokerage services income those increases were partially offset by a decline in mortgage banking revenues reflecting the impact of the companys decision to retain the substantial majority of recently originated mortgage loans in portfolio rather than sell such loans while still selling select loweryielding mortgage loans other income was million in the first quarter of the comparative increase in the recent quarter resulted from peoples unitedrelated noninterest income higher trust income
