which certain enhanced prudential standards eps apply to bhcs with billion or more in total consolidated assets the eps tailoring rule and the frb the office of the comptroller of the currency the occ and fdic adopted a rule that similarly adjusts the thresholds at which certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to bhcs and banks with billion or more in total consolidated assets the capital and liquidity tailoring rule and together with the eps tailoring rule the tailoring rules the tailoring rules establish four riskbased categories of institutions and the extent to fifth third bancorp which enhanced prudential standards and certain other capital and liquidity standards apply to these bhcs and banks depends on the banking organizations category under the tailoring rules the

the cfpb some of the bancorps and the banks regulators are also empowered to assess civil money penalties against companies or individuals in certain situations such as when there is a violation of a law or regulation applicable state and federal laws also grant the bancorps regulators the authority to impose additional requirements and restrictions on the activities of the bancorp and the bank and in some situations the imposition of such additional requirements and restrictions will not be publicly available information the following discussion describes certain elements of the comprehensive regulatory framework applicable to the bancorp and its subsidiaries this discussion is not intended to describe all laws and regulations applicable to the bancorp the bank and the bancorps other subsidiaries acquisitions the bhca requires the prior approval of the frb for a bhc to acquire substantially all the assets of a bank or to acquire direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of any class of the voting shares of any bank bhc or savings association or to merge or consolidate with any bhc the bhca generally prohibits a bhc from engaging in or acquiring a direct or indirect interest in or control of more than of any class of the voting shares of a company that is not a bank or a bhc that engages directly or indirectly in activities other than those of banking managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to its banking subsidiaries except that it may engage in and may own shares of companies engaged in certain activities the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto financial holding companies the bancorp is registered as a bhc with the frb under the bhca and qualifies for and has elected to become an fhc an fhc is permitted to engage directly or indirectly in a broader range of activities than those permitted for a bhc under the bhca permitted activities for an fhc include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and brokerage merchant banking and other activities that are declared by the frb in cooperation with the treasury department to be financial in nature or incidental thereto or are declared by the frb unilaterally to be complementary to financial activities in addition an fhc is allowed to conduct permissible new financial activities or acquire permissible nonbank financial companies with afterthefact notice to the frb a bhc may elect to become an fhc if the bhc is wellcapitalized and is well managed and each of its banking subsidiaries is wellcapitalized is well managed and has at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act cra to maintain fhc status a bhc must continue to meet these requirements the failure to meet such requirements could result in material restrictions on the activities of the fhc and may also adversely affect the fhcs ability to enter into certain transactions including mergers and acquisitions or obtain necessary approvals in connection therewith as well as loss of fhc status if restrictions are imposed on the activities of an fhc such information may not necessarily be available to the public dividends the bancorp is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries and depends in part upon dividends received from its direct and indirect subsidiaries including the bank to fund its activities including its ability to make capital distributions such as paying dividends or repurchasing shares under federal law there are various limitations on the extent to which the bank can declare and pay dividends to the bancorp including those related to regulatory capital requirements general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits surplus and available earnings certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the bancorp no assurances can be given that the bank will in any circumstances pay dividends to the bancorp fifth third bancorp the bancorps ability to declare and pay dividends is similarly limited by federal banking law and frb regulations and policy the frb has authority to prohibit bhcs from making capital distributions if they would be deemed to be an unsafe or unsound practice the frb has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for bhcs to pay dividends unless a bhcs net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with the organizations capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition in addition the bancorps ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends and repurchasing shares is subject to the bancorp complying with the automatic restrictions on capital distributions under the frbs capital rules process discussed below see regulatory capital requirements below source of strength a bhc including the bancorp is expected to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to each of its banking subsidiaries and to commit resources to their support this support may be required at times when the bhc may not have the resources to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of the bancorp or its shareholders or creditors the frb may require a bhc to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bhc with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bhc fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the frb believes might jeopardize the bhcs ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements the bancorp may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should it experience financial distress capital loans by the bancorp to the bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the bank in the event of the bancorps bankruptcy any commitment by the bancorp to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment fdic assessments the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of per depositor per account ownership category and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions based on the risk each institution poses to the dif the bank accepts customer deposits that are insured by the dif and therefore must pay insurance premiums the fdic may increase the banks insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdics assessment of its risk profile as of june the dif reserve ratio fell to below the statutory minimum of the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act established a plan on september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of within eight years on october the fdic adopted an amended restoration plan to increase the likelihood that the reserve ratio would be restored to at least by september the fdics amended restoration plan increases the initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by basis points beginning in the first quarterly assessment period of the fdic could further increase the deposit insurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions including the bank if the dif reserve ratio is not restored as projected transactions with affiliates federal banking laws restrict transactions between a bank and its affiliates including a parent bhc the bank is subject to these restrictions which include quantitative and qualitative limits on the amounts and types of transactions that may take place including extensions of credit to affiliates investments in the stock or securities of affiliates purchases of assets from affiliates and certain other transactions with affiliates these restrictions also require that credit transactions with affiliates be collateralized and that transactions with affiliates be on market terms or better for the bank generally a banks covered transactions with any affiliate are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus and covered transactions with all affiliates are limited to of the banks capital stock and surplus doddfrank expanded the scope of these regulations including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as the bank and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders community reinvestment act the cra generally requires insured depository institutions including the bank to identify the communities they serve and to make loans and investments and provide services that meet the credit needs of those communities the cra requires the occ to evaluate the performance of national banks including the bank with respect to these cra obligations depository institutions must maintain comprehensive records of their cra activities for purposes of these examinations the occ must take into account the institutions record of performance in meeting the credit needs of the entire community served including lowand moderateincome neighborhoods for purposes of cra examinations the occ rates each institutions compliance with the cra as outstanding satisfactory needs to improve or substantial noncompliance the bank received an outstanding rating on its most recent cra performance examination from the occ the cra requires the relevant federal bank regulatory agency to consider a banks cra assessment when considering the banks application to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions or to open or relocate a branch office the frb also must consider the cra record of each subsidiary bank of a bhc in connection with any acquisition or merger application filed by the bhc an unsatisfactory cra record could substantially delay or result in the denial of an approval or application by the bancorp or the bank fifth third bancorp on may the occ frb and fdic issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to provide for a coordinated approach to modernize their respective cra regulations such that all banks will be subject to the same set of cra rules no final rule has been issued but the rulemaking may affect the banks cra compliance obligations in the future regulatory capital requirements the bancorp and the bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements under the capital adequacy rules the capital rules adopted by the frb for the bancorp and by the occ for the bank these quantitative calculations are minimums and the frb and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on the bancorps operations or financial condition failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on the bancorps or the banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications under the capital rules the bancorps and the banks assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions riskweighted assets pursuant to the federal banking agencies standardized approach to riskweighting of assets these riskweighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for the bancorp and the bank common equity tier cet1 capital ratio equal to the ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets cet1 capital primarily includes common shareholders equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions including with respect to goodwill intangible assets certain deferred tax assets and accumulated other comprehensive income aoci the bancorp has elected to exclude certain aoci components with the result that those components are not recognized in the bancorps cet1 the fdic frb and occ have jointly issued rules for institutions that do not apply advanced approaches to regulatory capital including the bancorp and the bank these rules simplified the capital treatment of certain items including mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions and simplified the recognition and calculation of minority interests that are includable in regulatory capital the advanced approaches to regulatory capital are generally required for large internationally active banking organizations including those designated as global systemically important bank holding companies and those with total assets or crossjurisdictional activity in excess of certain thresholds tier riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital is primarily comprised of cet1 capital perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments total riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of total capital including cet1 capital tier capital and tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying allowance for loan and lease losses alll tier capital also includes among other things certain trust preferred securities leverage ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions in august the us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules under the new rule eligible retained income is the greater of a firms i net income for the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income and ii average net income over the preceding four quarters an institutions eligible retained income when considered in conjunction with capital ratios and the stress capital buffer provides limitations on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain executive compensation arrangements for the quarter following the calculation as of december the bancorp was permitted to use of its eligible retained income for these purposes in the first quarter of this definition applies with respect to all of the bancorps capital requirements in addition in december the us federal banking agencies finalized rules that would permit bhcs and banks to phasein for regulatory capital purposes the dayone impact of asu cecl on retained earnings over a period of three years as part of their response to the covid19 pandemic the us federal banking agencies issued another final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the final rule provides banking organizations that adopted cecl in the calendar year with the option to delay for two years the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital followed by the aforementioned threeyear transition period to phase out the aggregate amount of benefit during the initial twoyear delay for a total fiveyear transition the estimated impact of cecl on regulatory capital modified cecl transitional amount is calculated as the sum of the dayone impact on retained earnings upon adoption of cecl cecl transitional amount and the calculated change in the acl relative to the dayone acl upon adoption of cecl multiplied by a scaling factor of the scaling factor is used to approximate the difference in the acl under cecl relative to the incurred loss methodology the modified cecl transitional amount was calculated each quarter for the first two years of the fiveyear transition the amount of the modified cecl transition amount was then fixed as of december and that amount will be subject to the threeyear phase out the capital rules also require banking organizations to maintain a stress capital buffer to avoid becoming subject to certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers see stress buffer requirements below for more information related to the stress capital buffer refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the total minimum regulatory capital ratios and wellcapitalized minimum ratios are reflected in the table below the frb has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bhcs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the capital rules for purposes of the frbs regulation y including determining whether a bhc meets the requirements to be an fhc bhcs such as the bancorp must maintain fifth third bancorp a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater if the frb were to apply the same or a very similar wellcapitalized standard to bhcs as that applicable to the bank the bancorps capital ratios as of december would exceed such revised wellcapitalized standard the frb may require bhcs including the bancorp to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bhcs particular condition risk profile and growth plans the following table presents the minimum regulatory capital ratios minimum ratio plus stress capital buffer and wellcapitalized minimums

under frb regulation y and the wellcapitalized standard applicable to the bank liquidity regulation as a result of the tailoring rules the bancorp as a category iv banking organization is now exempt from the liquidity coverage ratio requirement but remains subject to internal liquidity stress tests and standards capital planning and stress testing bhcs with billion or more in consolidated assets including the bancorp generally must submit capital plans to the frb on an annual basis in march the frb adopted a final rule to integrate the annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements for large bhcs as a result the frbs annual ccar process is now used to calibrate the bancorps stress capital buffer requirement among other changes the revised capital plan rule also eliminates the assumption that the bancorps balance sheet assets would increase over the planning horizon in addition provided that the bancorp is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the capital rules the bancorp will no longer be required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan the bancorp is required to provide the frb notice within days after making any capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan under its ccar process the frb annually evaluates capital adequacy internal capital adequacy assessment processes and capital distribution plans of bhcs with billion or more in total consolidated assets the ccar process is intended to help ensure that those bhcs have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for each companys unique risks and that permit continued operations during times of economic and financial stress the mandatory elements of the capital plan are an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon a description of all planned capital actions over the planning horizon a discussion of any expected changes to the bhcs business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy or liquidity a detailed description of the bhcs process for assessing capital adequacy and the bhcs capital policy as a result of the eps tailoring rule the bancorp is subject to a quantitative assessment of capital through supervisory stress tests every two years with the next required assessment in these supervisory stress tests are forwardlooking quantitative evaluations of the impact of stressful economic and financial market conditions on the bancorps capital additionally under the eps tailoring rule the bancorp is no longer required to file semiannual companyrun stress tests with the frb and publicly disclose the results stress buffer requirements in march the frb issued a final rule amending regulatory capital rules capital plan rules and stress test rules under the final rule the capital conservation buffer was replaced with a stress capital buffer requirement during each supervisory stress testing cycle the frb will use the bancorps supervisory stress test to determine its stress capital buffer subject to a floor of similar to the capital conservation buffer the bancorp must maintain capital ratios above the sum of its minimum riskbased capital ratios and the stress capital buffer to avoid certain limitations on capital distributions and discretionary bonuses to executive officers the final rule is applicable to bhcs with fifth third bancorp billion or more in total consolidated assets and was effective on october the frb uses the supervisory stress test to determine the bancorps stress capital buffer subject to a floor of the bancorps stress capital buffer requirement has been since the introduction of this framework and was most recently affirmed in june of as part of the frbs supervisory stress test with an effective date of october the bancorps capital ratios have exceeded the stress capital buffer requirement for all periods presented enhanced prudential standards pursuant to title i of doddfrank certain us bhcs are subject to enhanced prudential standards and early remediation requirements as a result the bancorp is subject to more stringent standards including liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing resolution planning and risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards as discussed above under the eps tailoring rule the bancorp as a category iv banking organization is subject to the least restrictive enhanced prudential standards applicable to firms with billion or more in total consolidated assets as compared to enhanced prudential standards that were applicable to the bancorp under the eps tailoring rule the bancorp is no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements and is subject to less frequent supervisory stress tests less frequent internal liquidity stress tests and reduced liquidity risk management requirements heightened governance and risk management standards the occ has published guidelines documenting expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions including the bank the guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities in addition the guidelines provide standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls privacy and data security the occ frb fdic and other bank regulatory agencies have adopted guidelines for safeguarding confidential personal customer information the guidelines require each financial institution under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof to create implement and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access to or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer in addition various us regulators including the occ frb and the sec have increased their focus on cyber security through guidance examinations and regulations the bancorp has adopted a customer information security program that has been approved by the bancorps board of directors the glba requires financial institutions to implement policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of nonpublic personal information about consumers in general the statute requires explanations to consumers on policies and procedures regarding the disclosure of such nonpublic personal information and except as otherwise required by law prohibits disclosing such information except as provided in the banking subsidiarys policies and procedures the bancorps banking subsidiary has implemented a privacy policy states are also increasingly proposing or enacting legislation that relates to data privacy and data protection such as the california consumer privacy act the bancorp continues to assess the requirements of such laws and proposed legislation and their applicability to the bancorp moreover these laws and proposed legislation are still subject to revision or formal guidance and they may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our understanding like other lenders the bank and other of the bancorps subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fair credit reporting act fcra and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on the bancorp and its subsidiaries antimoney laundering and economic sanctions the bancorp is subject to federal laws that are designed to counter money laundering and terrorist financing and transactions with certain persons companies or foreign governments sanctioned by the united states these include the bank secrecy act the money laundering control act the usa patriot act
