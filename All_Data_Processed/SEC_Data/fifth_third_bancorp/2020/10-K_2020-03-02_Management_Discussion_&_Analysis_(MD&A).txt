item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda the following is managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of certain significant factors that have affected fifth third bancorps the bancorp or fifth third financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the consolidated financial statements which are a part of this filing reference to the bancorp incorporates the parent holding company and all consolidated subsidiaries the bancorps banking subsidiary is referred to as the bank overview this overview of mda highlights selected information in the financial results of the bancorp and may not contain all of the information that is important to you for a more complete understanding of trends events commitments uncertainties liquidity capital resources and critical accounting policies and estimates you should carefully read this entire document each of these items could have an impact on the bancorps financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition refer to the glossary of abbreviations and acronyms in this report for a list of terms

lease net chargeoffs to average portfolio commercial loans and leases was bps during the year ended december compared to bps during the year ended december the decrease was primarily due to an increase in average commercial loans and leases as a result of the mb financial inc acquisition as well as a decrease in net chargeoffs on commercial and industrial loans of million the ratio of consumer loan net chargeoffs to average portfolio consumer loans was bps for the year ended december compared to bps for the year ended december the increase was primarily due to increases in net

december and the bancorp recorded and respectively in both losses chargedoff and recoveries of losses chargedoff related to customer defaults on pointofsale consumer loans for which the bancorp obtained recoveries under thirdparty credit enhancements table end allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses is comprised of the alll and the reserve for unfunded commitments the alll provides coverage for probable and estimable losses in the loan and lease portfolio the bancorp evaluates the alll each quarter to determine its adequacy to cover inherent losses several factors are taken into consideration in the determination of the overall alll including an unallocated component these factors include but are not limited to the overall risk profile of the loan and lease portfolios net chargeoff experience the extent of impaired loans and leases the level of nonaccrual loans and leases the level of days past due loans and leases and the overall level of the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases the bancorp also considers overall asset quality trends credit administration and portfolio management practices risk identification practices credit policy and underwriting practices overall portfolio growth portfolio concentrations and current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio refer to the critical accounting policies section of mda for more information during the year ended december the bancorp did not substantively change any material aspect of its overall approach in the determination of the alll and there have been no material changes in assumptions or estimation techniques as compared to prior periods that impacted the determination of the current period allowance in addition to the alll the bancorp maintains a reserve for unfunded commitments recorded in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the methodology used to determine the adequacy of this reserve is similar to the bancorps methodology for determining the alll the provision for the reserve for unfunded commitments is included in provision for credit losses in the consolidated statements of income the alll attributable to the portion of the residential mortgage and consumer loan portfolios that has not been restructured in a tdr is calculated on a pooled basis with the segmentation based on the similarity of credit risk characteristics loss factors for consumer loans are developed for each pool based on the trailing twelvemonth historical loss rate as adjusted for certain prescriptive loss rate factors and certain qualitative adjustment factors the prescriptive loss rate factors and qualitative adjustments are designed to reflect risks associated with current conditions and trends which are not believed to be fully reflected in the trailing twelvemonth historical loss rate for real estate backed consumer loans the prescriptive loss rate factors include adjustments for delinquency trends ltv trends refreshed fico score trends and product mix and the qualitative factors include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting monitoring or collections economic conditions portfolio mix lending and risk management personnel results of internal audit and quality control reviews collateral values and geographic concentrations the bancorp considers home price index trends in its footprint and the volatility of collateral valuation trends when determining the collateral value qualitative factor the bancorps determination of the alll for commercial loans and leases is sensitive to the risk grades it assigns to these loans and leases in the event that of commercial loans and leases in each risk category would experience a downgrade of one risk category the allowance for commercial loans and leases would increase by approximately million at december in addition the bancorps determination of the alll for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates in the event that estimated loss rates would increase by the alll for residential mortgage loans and consumer loans would increase by approximately million at december as several qualitative and quantitative factors are considered in determining the alll these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the alll they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes to risk grades and estimated loss rates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk ratings or loss rates given current processes employed by the bancorp management believes the risk grades and estimated loss rates currently assigned are appropriate table start table changes in allowance for credit losses for the years ended december in millions alll balance beginning of period losses

december and the bancorp recorded and respectively in both losses chargedoff and recoveries of losses chargedoff related to customer defaults on pointofsale consumer loans for which the bancorp obtained recoveries under thirdparty credit enhancements table end certain inherent but unconfirmed losses are probable within the loan and lease portfolio the bancorps current methodology for determining the level of losses is based on historical loss rates current credit grades specific allocation on impaired commercial credits above specified thresholds and restructured loans and other qualitative adjustments due to the heavy reliance on realized historical losses and the credit grade rating process the modelderived estimate of the alll tends to slightly lag behind the deterioration in the portfolio in a stable or deteriorating credit environment and tends not to be as responsive when improved conditions have presented themselves given these model limitations the qualitative adjustment factors may be incremental or decremental to the quantitative model results an unallocated component of the alll is maintained to recognize the imprecision in estimating and measuring loss the unallocated allowance as a percent of total portfolio loans and leases at december and was and respectively the unallocated allowance was approximately of the total allowance at both december and as shown in table the alll as a percent of portfolio loans and leases was at december compared to at december this decrease reflects the impact of the mb financial inc acquisition which added approximately billion in portfolio loans and leases at the acquisition date loans acquired by the bancorp through a purchase business combination are recorded at fair value as of the acquisition date the bancorp does not carry over the acquired companys alll nor does the bancorp add to its existing alll as part of purchase accounting the alll was billion and billion at december and respectively

fasb issued asu which establishes a new approach to estimate credit losses on certain types of financial instruments the new approach changes the impairment model for most financial assets and will require the use of an expected credit loss model for financial instruments measured at amortized cost and certain other instruments the asu is effective for the bancorp on january based on portfolio characteristics and economic conditions and expectations as of january the bancorp recorded a combined increase to the alll and reserve for unfunded commitments on january of approximately million upon the adoption of asu the increase is based on economic forecasts that the bancorp considers reasonable and supportable for a period of three years followed by a reversion to longterm historical loss rates for the remaining contractual life adjusted for expected prepayments phased in over a period of two years the estimated increase in the alll is primarily attributable to longer duration consumer loans this increase includes the differences between the purchase accounting treatment of loans and leases acquired in the mb financial inc acquisition and the treatment under asu in the legacy portfolio excluding the mb financial inc loans and leases the bancorp recognized an increase to the alll of approximately million the impact on the bancorps alll in future periods may vary significantly from the adoption date as it will be based on changes in economic conditions economic forecasts and the composition and credit quality of the bancorps loan and lease portfolio the adoption of asu will also have an impact on the provision for credit losses in periods after adoption which could differ materially from historical trends for additional information on asu refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements market risk management market risk is the daytoday potential for the value of a financial instrument to fluctuate due to movements in market factors the bancorps market risk includes risks resulting from movements in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices interest rate risk a component of market risk primarily impacts the bancorps income categories through changes in interest income on earning assets and the cost of interestbearing liabilities and through fee items that are related to interest sensitive activities such as mortgage origination and servicing income and through earnings credits earned on commercial deposits that offset commercial deposit fees management considers interest rate risk a prominent market risk in terms of its potential impact on earnings interest rate risk may occur for any one or more of the following reasons table start assets and liabilities mature or reprice at different times table end table start shortterm and longterm market interest rates change by different amounts or table end table start the expected maturities of various assets or liabilities shorten or lengthen as interest rates change table end fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in addition to the direct impact of interest rate changes on nii and interestsensitive fees interest rates can impact earnings through their effect on loan and deposit demand credit losses mortgage origination volumes the value of servicing rights and other sources of the bancorps earnings stability of the bancorps net income is largely dependent upon the effective management of interest rate risk management continually reviews the bancorps balance sheet composition and earnings flows and models the interest rate risk and possible actions to manage this risk given numerous possible future interest rate scenarios a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are employed to ensure that this risk is managed within the bancorps risk tolerance in addition to the traditional forms of interest rate risk discussed in this section the bancorp is exposed to interest rate risk associated with the retirement and replacement of libor for more information on the libor transition refer to the overview section of mda interest rate risk management oversight the bancorps alco which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc monitors and manages interest rate risk within boardapproved policy limits in addition to the risk management activities of alco the bancorp has a market risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of market risk activities net interest income sensitivity the bancorp employs a variety of measurement techniques to identify and manage its interest rate risk including the use of an nii simulation model to analyze the sensitivity of nii to changes in interest rates the model is based on contractual and estimated cash flows and repricing characteristics for all of the bancorps assets liabilities and offbalance sheet exposures and incorporates marketbased assumptions regarding the effect of changing interest rates on the prepayment rates of certain assets and attrition rates of certain liabilities the model also includes senior managements projections of the future volume and pricing of each of the product lines offered by the bancorp as well as other pertinent assumptions actual results may differ from simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes deviations from projected assumptions as well as from changes in market conditions and management strategies as of december the bancorps interest rate risk exposure is governed by a risk framework that utilizes the change in nii over 12month and 24month horizons assuming a bps parallel ramped increase and a bps parallel ramped decrease in interest rates additionally the bancorp routinely analyzes various potential and extreme scenarios including ramps shocks and nonparallel shifts in rates to assess where risks to net interest income persist or develop as changes in the balance sheet and market rates evolve in order to recognize the risk of noninterestbearing demand deposit balance runoff in a rising interest rate environment the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes that approximately million of additional demand deposit balances runoff over months above what is included in senior managements baseline projections for each bps increase in shortterm market interest rates similarly the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling incorporates approximately million of incremental growth in noninterestbearing deposit balances over months above senior managements baseline projections for each bps decrease in shortterm market interest rates the incremental balance runoff and growth are modeled to flow into and out of funding products that reprice in conjunction with shortterm market rate changes another important deposit modeling assumption is the amount by which interestbearing deposit rates will increase or decrease when market interest rates increase or decrease this deposit repricing sensitivity is known as the beta and it represents the expected amount by which bancorp deposit rates will change for a given change in shortterm market rates the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weightedaverage risingrate interestbearing deposit beta of at december which is approximately to percentage points higher than the average beta that the bancorp experienced in the frb tightening cycles from june to june and from december to december the bancorps nii sensitivity modeling assumes a weightedaverage fallingrate interestbearing deposit beta of at december in addition the modeling assumes there is no lag between the timing of changes in market rates and the timing of deposit repricing despite such timing lags having occurred in prior rate cycles the bancorp continually evaluates the sensitivity of its interest rate risk measures to these important deposit modeling assumptions the bancorp also regularly monitors the sensitivity of other important modeling assumptions such as loan and security prepayments and early withdrawals on fixedrate customer liabilities the following table shows the bancorps estimated nii sensitivity profile and alco policy limits as of december table start table estimated nii sensitivity profile and alco policy limits change in nii fte alco policy limits change in nii fte alco policy limits change in interest rates bps months months months months months months months months ramp over months ramp over months na na na na ramp over months na na ramp over months na na na na table end at december the bancorps nii sensitivity under the parallel rate ramp increases is near neutral in the first year and would benefit in the second year under the parallel bps ramp decrease in interest rates the bancorps nii would decline in both the first and second years the asymmetric nii sensitivity profile is attributable to the combination of floatingrate assets including the predominantly floatingrate commercial loan portfolio and certain intermediateterm fixedrate liabilities and managedrate deposits reductions in the yield of the commercial loan portfolio would be expected to be only partially offset by a decline in the cost of interestbearing deposits in this scenario however proactive management of the securities and derivatives portfolios has reduced the nearterm risk to declining market rates fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the changes in the estimated nii sensitivity profile as of december compared to december were primarily attributable to the acquisition of mb financial inc which had a more assetsensitive balance sheet the down rate scenarios were also impacted by lower market interest rates and a higher composition of lowcost deposits which results in deposits hitting their floor rates more quickly in the current year scenarios however the strategic repositioning of the investment portfolio into securities that are less callable in the near term more than offset the impact of the mb financial inc acquisition on nii at risk in year one and partially offset the impact in year two tables and provide the sensitivity of the bancorps estimated nii profile at december to changes to certain deposit balance and deposit repricing

interest rates bps months months months months ramp over months ramp over months ramp over months table end economic value of equity sensitivity the bancorp also uses eve as a measurement tool in managing interest rate risk whereas the nii sensitivity analysis highlights the impact on forecasted nii on an fte basis nongaap over one and twoyear time horizons eve is a pointintime analysis of the economic sensitivity of current positions that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives the eve of the balance sheet is defined as the discounted present value of all asset and net derivative cash flows less the discounted value of all liability cash flows due to this longer horizon the sensitivity of eve to changes in the level of interest rates is a measure of longerterm interest rate risk eve values only the current balance sheet and does not incorporate the balance growth assumptions used in the nii sensitivity analysis as with the nii simulation model assumptions about the timing and variability of existing balance sheet cash flows are critical in the eve analysis particularly important are assumptions driving loan and security prepayments and the expected balance attrition and pricing of indeterminatelived deposits the following table shows the bancorps estimated eve sensitivity profile as of december table start table estimated eve sensitivity profile change in interest rates bps change in eve alco policy limit change in eve alco policy limit shock shock na na shock na na na shock na na shock na na table end the eve sensitivity is moderately negative in both a bps risingrate and a bps decliningrate market rate scenario at december the changes in the estimated eve sensitivity profile from december were primarily related to noninterestbearing deposits growth from the acquisition of mb financial inc and a decrease in market interest rates these items were partially offset by strategic repositioning of the investment portfolio into securities that are less callable in the near term while an instantaneous shift in interest rates is used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure the bancorp believes that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a much more modest impact fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon eg the current fiscal year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships and changing product spreads that could mitigate or exacerbate the impact of changes in interest rates the nii simulations and eve analyses do not necessarily include certain actions that management may undertake to manage risk in response to actual changes in interest rates the bancorp regularly evaluates its exposures to a static balance sheet forecast libor prime rate and other basis risks yield curve twist risks and embedded options risks in addition the impacts on nii on an fte basis and eve of extreme changes in interest rates are modeled wherein the bancorp employs the use of yield curve shocks and environmentspecific scenarios use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of the bancorps interest rate risk management strategy is its use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that the bancorp may use as part of its interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps interest rate floors interest rate caps forward contracts forward starting interest rate swaps options swaptions and tba securities tables and show all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing the bancorps exposures to the variability of interest rates these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as the bancorp adjusts its broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the following tables present

for as freestanding derivatives to economically hedge irlcs that are also considered freestanding derivatives the bancorp economically hedges its exposure to residential mortgage loans held for sale through the use of forward contracts and mortgage options as well see the residential mortgage servicing rights and interest rate risk section for the discussion of the use of derivatives to economically hedge this exposure the bancorp also enters into derivative contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge market risks assumed in interest rate derivative contracts with commercial customers generally these contracts have similar terms in order to protect the bancorp from market volatility credit risk arises from the possible inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts which the bancorp minimizes through collateral arrangements approvals limits and monitoring procedures the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers these controls include an independent determination of interest rate volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements portfolio loans and leases and interest rate risk although the bancorps portfolio loans and leases contain both fixed and floatingadjustablerate products the rates of interest earned by the bancorp on the outstanding balances are generally established for a period of time the interest rate sensitivity of loans and leases is directly related to the length of time the rate earned is established fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following table summarizes the carrying value

residential mortgage servicing rights and interest rate risk the fair value of the residential msr portfolio was million and million at december and december respectively the portfolio of servicing rights included million of servicing rights acquired in the acquisition of mb financial inc on march the value of servicing rights can fluctuate sharply depending on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and loans are prepaid to take advantage of refinancing the total value of existing servicing rights declines because no further servicing fees are collected on repaid loans the bancorp maintains a nonqualifying hedging strategy relative to its mortgage banking activity in order to manage a portion of the risk associated with changes in the value of its msr portfolio as a result of changing interest rates mortgage rates decreased during the year ended december which caused modeled prepayment speeds to rise the fair value of the msr portfolio decreased million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas assumptions and decreased million due to the passage of time including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments paydowns and payoffs for the year ended december mortgage rates increased during the year ended december which caused modeled prepayment speeds to slow the fair value of the msr portfolio increased million due to changes to inputs to the valuation model including prepayment speeds and oas assumptions and decreased million due to the passage of time including the impact of regularly scheduled repayments paydowns and payoffs for the year ended december the bancorp recognized net gains of million and net losses of million respectively on its nonqualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december and these amounts include net gains of million and net losses of million respectively on securities related to the bancorps nonqualifying hedging strategy during the years ended december and the bancorp may adjust its hedging strategy to reflect its assessment of the composition of its msr portfolio the cost of hedging and the anticipated effectiveness of the hedges given the economic environment refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on servicing rights and the instruments used to hedge interest rate risk on msrs foreign currency risk the bancorp may enter into foreign exchange derivative contracts to economically hedge certain foreign denominated loans the derivatives are classified as freestanding instruments with the revaluation gain or loss being recorded in other noninterest income in the consolidated statements of income the balance of the bancorps foreign denominated loans at december and was million and million respectively the bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to foreign currency fluctuations similar to the hedging of interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts entered into with commercial customers the bancorp also enters into foreign exchange contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven foreign exchange activity fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not being taken in providing this service to customers these controls include an independent determination of currency volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts counterparty credit approvals and country limits performed by independent risk management commodity risk the bancorp also enters into commodity contracts for the benefit of commercial customers to hedge their exposure to commodity price fluctuations similar to the hedging of foreign exchange and interest rate risk from interest rate derivative contracts the bancorp also enters into commodity contracts with major financial institutions to economically hedge a substantial portion of the exposure from client driven commodity activity the bancorp may also offset this risk with exchangetraded commodity contracts the bancorp has risk limits and internal controls in place to help ensure excessive risk is not taken in providing this service to customers these controls include an independent determination of commodity volatility and credit equivalent exposure on these contracts and counterparty credit approvals performed by independent risk management liquidity risk management the goal of liquidity management is to provide adequate funds to meet changes in loan and lease demand unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals and other contractual obligations mitigating liquidity risk is accomplished by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash and investment securities maintaining sufficient unused borrowing capacity in the debt markets and delivering consistent growth in core deposits a summary of certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts is included in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements the bancorps treasury department manages funding and liquidity based on pointintime metrics as well as forwardlooking projections which incorporate different sources and uses of funds under base and stress scenarios liquidity risk is monitored and managed by the treasury department with independent oversight provided by erm and a series of policy limits and key risk indicators are established to ensure risks are managed within the bancorps risk tolerance the bancorp maintains a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing which assesses the liquidity needs under varying market conditions time horizons asset growth rates and other events the contingency plan provides for ongoing monitoring of unused borrowing capacity and available sources of contingent liquidity to prepare for unexpected liquidity needs and to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity the contingency plan also outlines the bancorps response to various levels of liquidity stress and actions that should be taken during various scenarios liquidity risk is monitored and managed for both fifth third bancorp and its subsidiaries the bancorp receives substantially all of its liquidity from dividends from its subsidiaries primarily fifth third bank national association subsidiary dividends are supplemented with term debt to enable the bancorp to maintain sufficient liquidity to meet its cash obligations including debt service and scheduled maturities common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to subsidiaries and other planned capital actions in the form of share repurchases liquidity resources are more limited at the bancorp making its liquidity position more susceptible to market disruptions bancorp liquidity is assessed using a cash coverage horizon ensuring the entity maintains sufficient liquidity to withstand a period of sustained market disruption while meeting its anticipated obligations over an extended stressed horizon the bancorps alco which includes senior management representatives and is accountable to the ermc monitors and manages liquidity and funding risk within boardapproved policy limits in addition to the risk management activities of alco the bancorp has a market risk management function as part of erm that provides independent oversight of liquidity risk management sources of funds the bancorps primary sources of funds relate to cash flows from loan and lease repayments payments from securities related to sales and maturities the sale or securitization of loans and leases and funds generated by core deposits in addition to the use of public and private debt offerings table of the market risk management subsection of the risk management section of mda illustrates the expected maturities from loan and lease repayments of the billion of securities in the bancorps availableforsale debt and other securities portfolio at december billion in principal and interest is expected to be received in the next months and an additional billion is expected to be received in the next to months for further information on the bancorps securities portfolio refer to the investment securities subsection of the balance sheet analysis section of mda assetdriven liquidity is provided by the bancorps ability to sell or securitize loans and leases in order to reduce the exposure to interest rate fluctuations and to manage liquidity the bancorp has developed securitization and sale procedures for several types of interestsensitive assets a majority of the longterm fixedrate singlefamily residential mortgage loans underwritten according to fhlmc or fnma guidelines are sold for cash upon origination additional assets such as certain other residential mortgage loans certain commercial loans home equity loans automobile loans and other consumer loans are also capable of being securitized or sold the bancorp sold or securitized loans and leases totaling billion during the year ended december compared to billion during the year ended december for further information refer to note and note of the notes to consolidated financial statements core deposits have historically provided the bancorp with a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funds the bancorps average core deposits and average shareholders equity funded of its average total assets for both the years ended december and in addition to core deposit funding the bancorp also accesses a variety of other shortterm and longterm funding sources which include the use of the fhlb system certificates and over and certain deposits in the bancorps foreign branch located in the cayman islands are wholesale funding tools utilized to fund asset growth management does not rely on any one source of liquidity and manages availability in response to changing balance sheet needs as of december billion of debt or other securities were available for issuance under the current bancorps board of directors authorizations and the bancorp is authorized to file any necessary registration statements with the sec to permit ready access to the public securities markets however access to these markets may depend on market conditions during the year ended december the bancorp issued and sold billion of senior fixedrate notes and million of senior fixedrate notes fifth third bancorp managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations additionally during the year ended december the bancorp issued in a registered public offering depositary shares representing  of noncumulative series k perpetual preferred stock for net proceeds of approximately million as of december the banks global bank note program had a borrowing capacity of billion of which billion was available for issuance during the year ended the bank issued and sold million of senior floatingrate bank notes for further information on a subsequent event related to longterm debt refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements additionally at december the bank had approximately billion of borrowing capacity available through secured borrowing sources including the frb and fhlb in a securitization transaction that occurred in the bancorp transferred approximately billion in automobile loans to a bankruptcy remote trust which subsequently issued approximately billion of assetbacked notes of which approximately million of the assetbacked notes were retained by the bancorp and resulted in approximately billion of outstanding notes included in longterm debt in the consolidated balance sheets the bankruptcy remote trust was deemed to be a vie and the bancorp as the primary beneficiary consolidated the vie the thirdparty holders of the assetbacked notes do not have recourse to the general assets of the bancorp refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio on october the board of governors of the frb released a series of regulatory proposals to implement the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act reform act among the proposals the board of governors joined by the department of treasury occ and the fdic proposed to remove the application of the lcr regulations and the nsfr from certain bhcs that qualify under the proposal as category iv institutions primarily those bhcs with consolidated assets between billion and billion on october the board of governors of the frb announced it finalized the rules that tailor its regulations for banks to more closely match their risk profile fifth third as a category iv institution is no longer subject to the lcr regulations and the nsfr regulations effective december credit ratings the cost and availability of financing to the bancorp and bank are impacted by its credit ratings a downgrade to the bancorps or banks credit ratings could affect its ability to access the credit markets and increase its borrowing costs thereby adversely impacting the bancorps or banks financial condition and liquidity key factors in maintaining high credit ratings include a stable and diverse earnings stream strong credit quality strong capital ratios and diverse funding sources in addition to disciplined liquidity monitoring procedures the bancorps and banks credit ratings are summarized in table the ratings reflect the ratings agencys view on the bancorps and banks capacity to meet
