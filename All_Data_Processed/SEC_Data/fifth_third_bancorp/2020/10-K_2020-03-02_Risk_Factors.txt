liability or significant regulatory or other enforcement action against fifth third could materially adversely affect its business financial condition or results of operations andor cause significant reputational harm to its business the outcome of lawsuits and regulatory proceedings may be difficult to predict or estimate although fifth third establishes accruals for legal proceedings when information related to the loss contingencies represented by those matters indicates both that a loss is probable and that the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated fifth third does not have accruals for all legal proceedings where it faces a risk of loss in addition due to the inherent subjectivity of the assessments and unpredictability of the outcome of legal proceedings amounts accrued may not represent the ultimate loss to fifth third from the legal proceedings in question thus fifth thirds ultimate losses may be higher and possibly significantly so than the amounts accrued for legal loss contingencies which could adversely affect fifth thirds results of operations in addition there has been a trend of public settlements with governmental agencies that may adversely affect other financial institutions to the extent such settlements are used as a template for future settlements the uncertain regulatory enforcement environment makes it difficult to estimate probable losses which can lead to substantial disparities between legal reserves and actual settlements or penalties for further information on specific legal and regulatory proceedings refer to note

repurchase reserve strategic risks if fifth third does not respond to intense competition and rapid changes in the financial services industry or otherwise adapt to changing customer preferences its financial performance may suffer fifth thirds ability to deliver strong financial performance and returns on investment to shareholders will depend in part on its ability to expand the scope of available financial services to meet the needs and demands of its customers in addition to the challenge of competing against other banks in attracting and retaining customers for traditional banking services fifth thirds competitors also include securities dealers brokers mortgage bankers investment advisors and specialty finance telecommunications technology and insurance companies as well as

to their customers in the past or may not be currently able or allowed to offer many of these other firms may be significantly larger than fifth third and may have access to customers and financial resources that are beyond fifth thirds capability fifth third competes with these firms with respect to capital access to capital revenue generation products services transaction execution innovation reputation talent and price this increasingly competitive environment is primarily a result of changes in customer preferences regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems as well as the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers rapidly changing technology and consumer preferences may require fifth third to effectively implement new technologydriven

as branches as well as its retail work force and other branch banking assets advances in technology such as ecommerce telephone internet and mobile banking and inbranch selfservice technologies including automatic teller machines and other equipment as well as changing customer preferences for these other methods of accessing fifth thirds products and services could affect the value of fifth thirds branch network or other retail distribution assets and may cause it to change its retail distribution strategy close andor sell certain branches or parcels of land held for development and restructure or reduce its remaining branches and work force further advances in technology andor changes in customer preferences could have additional changes in fifth thirds retail distribution strategy andor branch network these actions could lead to losses on these assets or could adversely impact the carrying value of other longlived assets and may lead to increased expenditures to renovate and reconfigure remaining branches or to otherwise reform its retail distribution channel difficulties in identifying suitable opportunities or combining the operations of acquired entities or assets with fifth thirds own operations or assessing the effectiveness of businesses in which we make strategic investments or with which we enter into strategic contractual relationships may prevent fifth third from achieving the expected benefits from these acquisitions investments or relationships inherent uncertainties exist when assessing acquiring or integrating the operations of another business or investment or relationship opportunity fifth third may not be able to fully achieve its strategic objectives and planned operating efficiencies relevant to an acquisition or strategic relationship in addition the markets and industries in which fifth third and its potential acquisition and investment targets operate are highly competitive acquisition or investment targets may lose customers or otherwise perform poorly or unprofitably or in the case of an acquired business or strategic relationship cause fifth third to lose customers or perform poorly or unprofitably future acquisition and investment activities and efforts to monitor newly acquired businesses or reap the benefits of a new strategic relationship may require fifth third to devote substantial time and resources and may cause these acquisitions investments and relationships to be unprofitable or cause fifth third to be unable to pursue other business opportunities after completing an acquisition fifth third may find that certain material information was not adequately disclosed during the due diligence process or that certain items were not accounted for properly in accordance with financial accounting and reporting standards fifth third may also not realize the expected benefits of the acquisition due to lower financial results pertaining to the acquired entity or assets for example fifth third could experience higher chargeoffs than originally anticipated related to the acquired loan portfolio additionally acquired companies or businesses may increase fifth thirds risk of regulatory action or restrictions related to the operations of the acquired business future acquisitions may dilute current shareholders ownership of fifth third and may cause fifth third to become more susceptible to adverse economic events future business acquisitions could be material to fifth third and it may issue additional shares of stock to pay for those acquisitions which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests acquisitions also could require fifth third to use substantial cash or other liquid assets or to incur debt in those events fifth third could become more susceptible to economic downturns dislocations in capital markets and competitive pressures fifth third bancorp fifth third may sell or consider selling one or more of its businesses or investments

nonstrategic businesses investments and other assets that are not significantly synergistic with its core financial services businesses or in the future may no longer be aligned with fifth thirds

sale or result in an unsuccessful sale if fifth third were to complete the sale of any of its businesses investments andor interests in third parties it would lose the income from the sold businesses andor interests including those accounted for under the equity method of accounting and such loss of income could have an adverse effect on its future earnings and growth additionally fifth third may encounter difficulties in separating the operations of any businesses it sells which may affect its business or results of operations general business risks changes in accounting standards or interpretations could impact fifth thirds reported earnings and financial condition the accounting standard setters including the fasb the sec and other regulatory agencies periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of fifth thirds consolidated financial statements for example in june the fasb issued a new current expected credit loss rule cecl which will require banks to record at the time of origination credit losses expected throughout the life of the asset portfolio on loans and heldtomaturity securities as opposed to the current practice of recording losses when it is probable that a loss event has occurred for additional information refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements these changes can be hard to predict and can materially impact how fifth third records and reports its financial condition and results of operations in some cases fifth third could be required to apply a new or revised standard retroactively which would result in the recasting of fifth thirds prior period financial statements fifth third uses models for business planning purposes that may not adequately predict future results fifth third uses financial models to aid in its planning for various purposes including its capital and liquidity needs and other purposes the models used may not accurately account for all variables may fail to predict outcomes accurately andor may overstate or understate certain effects as a result of these potential failures fifth third may not adequately prepare for future events and may suffer losses or other setbacks due to these failures also information fifth third provides to the public or to its regulators based on models could be inaccurate or misleading due to inadequate design or implementation for example decisions that its regulators make including those related to capital distributions to its shareholders could be affected adversely due to the perception that the models used to generate the relevant information are unreliable or inadequate the preparation of financial statements requires fifth third to make subjective determinations and use estimates that may vary from actual results and materially impact its results of operations or financial position the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make significant estimates that affect the financial statements if new information arises that results in a material change to a reserve amount such a change could result in a change to previously announced financial results refer to the critical accounting policies section of managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for more information regarding

these regions have experienced weather events including hurricanes tornadoes fires and other natural disasters the nature and level of these events and the impact of global climate change upon their frequency and severity cannot be predicted if large scale events occur they may significantly impact its loan portfolios by damaging properties pledged as collateral as well as impairing its borrowers ability to repay their loans additionally the impact of widespread health emergencies may adversely impact fifth thirds results of operations such as the potential impact from the recent outbreak of the coronavirus which originated in wuhan hubei province china but has now spread to other countries if its borrowers are adversely affected or if the virus leads to a widespread health emergency that impacts fifth third employees vendors or economic growth generally fifth thirds financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected despite having no direct operations in china societal responses to climate change could adversely affect fifth thirds business and performance including indirectly through impacts on fifth thirds customers concerns over the longterm impacts of climate change have led and may continue to lead to governmental efforts around the world to mitigate those impacts consumers and businesses also may change their behavior on their own as a result of these concerns fifth third and its customers will need to respond to new laws and regulations as well as consumer and business preferences resulting from climate change concerns fifth third and its customers may face cost increases asset value reductions operating process changes and the like the impact on fifth thirds customers will likely vary depending on their specific attributes including reliance on or role in carbon intensive activities fifth third could experience a drop in demand for fifth thirds products and services particularly in certain sectors in addition fifth third could face reductions in creditworthiness on the part of some customers or in the value of assets securing loans fifth thirds efforts to take these risks into account in making lending and other decisions including by increasing business relationships with climatefriendly companies may not be effective in protecting fifth third from the negative impact of new laws and regulations or changes in consumer or business behavior fifth third is exposed to reputational risk fifth thirds actual or alleged conduct in activities such as certain sales and lending practices data security corporate governance and acquisitions behavior of employees association with particular customers business partners investments or vendors as well as developments from any of the other risks described above may result in negative public opinion and may damage fifth thirds reputation actions taken by government regulators shareholder activists and community organizations may also damage fifth thirds reputation fifth third bancorp additionally whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media the advent and expansion of social media facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation though fifth third monitors social media channels the potential remains for rapid and widespread dissemination of inaccurate misleading or false information that could damage fifth thirds reputation negative public opinion can adversely affect fifth thirds ability to attract and keep customers and can increase the risk that it will be a target of litigation and regulatory action social activists are increasingly targeting financial firms with public criticism for their relationships with clients that are engaged in certain sensitive industries including businesses whose products are or are perceived to be harmful to health or the social good activist criticism of fifth thirds relationships with clients in sensitive industries could potentially engender dissatisfaction among clients customers investors and employees with how fifth third addresses social concerns through business activities which could negatively affect our reputation potential noncompliance with evolving federal and state laws governing cannabisrelated businesses crbs could subject us to liabilities while states have legalized some form of marijuana it remains a class controlled substance under federal law hemp is no longer classified as a class controlled substance under federal law however the regulatory scheme governing hemp has not been fully developed further the naked eye cannot distinguish between legal hemp and illegal marijuana under federal law there are a number of states where fifth third operates with laws permitting medicinal or recreational marijuana which increases the probability of individuals or entities using bank products or services to sell distribute cultivate manufacture or profit from marijuana this and the divergence and continued changes in laws governing crbs results in challenges to us to maintain compliance with them particularly in connection with our commercial and consumer lending and capital markets businesses while we monitor regulatory developments in this area to avoid noncompliance we cannot assure you that we will be at all times fully compliant with crbrelated laws which could result in significant fines penalties or other losses risks related to merger with mb financial inc fifth third may fail to realize the anticipated benefits of the merger and may face increased risks

disrupt the existing customer relationships of fifth third or mb financial or result in decreased revenues due to loss of customers if fifth third is not able to successfully achieve these objectives
