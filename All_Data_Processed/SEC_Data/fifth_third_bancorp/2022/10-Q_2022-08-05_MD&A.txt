interest income earned on assets such as loans leases and securities and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates the relative level of shortterm and longterm interest rates changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities generally the rates of interest the bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time the change in market interest rates over time exposes the bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position the bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates additionally in the ordinary course of business the bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks the bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its loan and lease portfolio as a result of changing expected cash flows caused by borrower credit events such as loan defaults and inadequate collateral

monitor the pandemic and its effect on customers employees communities and markets managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the years ended december and low interest rates reduced economic activity and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on the bancorps performance the bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact that these factors have had on its operating results since the pandemic began and these factors may adversely impact its future operating results current economic conditions robust demand labor shortages and supply chain constraints have led to persistent inflationary pressures throughout the economy in response to these inflationary pressures the frb has raised benchmark interest rates in recent months and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions particularly a continued high rate of inflation amidst these uncertainties financial markets have continued to experience volatility changes in interest rates can affect numerous aspects of the bancorps business and may impact the bancorps future performance if financial markets remain volatile this may impact the future performance of various segments of the bancorps business including the value of the bancorps investment securities portfolio the bancorp continues to closely monitor the pace of inflation

generally requires assets acquired and liabilities assumed to be recorded at their estimated fair values at acquisition date these fair value estimates are considered preliminary as of june and are subject to change for up to one year after the acquisition date as additional information becomes available for more information on the acquisition refer to notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements libor transition in july the chief executive of the united kingdom financial conduct authority the fca which regulates libor announced that the fca will stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor to the administrator of libor after since then central banks around the world including the federal reserve have commissioned working groups of market participants and official sector representatives with the goal of finding suitable replacements for libor on march the fca and ice benchmark administration limited announced that the publication of the oneweek and twomonth usd libor maturities and nonusd libor maturities would cease immediately after december with the remaining usd libor maturities ceasing immediately after june in the united states the alternative rates reference committee the arrc a group of market participants convened in to help ensure a successful transition away from usd libor identified sofr as its preferred alternative rate sofr is a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight collateralized by us treasury securities and is based on directly observable us treasurybacked repurchase transactions the composition and characteristics of sofr are not the same as those of libor and sofr is fundamentally different from libor for two key reasons sofr is a secured rate while libor is an unsecured rate and sofr is an overnight rate while libor is a forwardlooking rate that represents interbank funding over different maturities as a result there can be no assurance that sofr however calculated will perform the same way as libor would have at any time including as a result of changes in interest and yield rates in the market market volatility or global or regional economic financial political regulatory judicial or other events on march president biden signed the adjustable interest rate libor act the libor act into law the libor act offers a federal solution for transitioning legacy instruments that lack sufficient provisions addressing libors cessation by outlining a uniform process to govern the transition from libor to a replacement rate the libor act also establishes a safe harbor for lenders shielding lenders from litigation as a result of their choice of a replacement rate such as sofr per federal reserve board recommendations the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued federal reserve board is required to promulgate regulations carrying out the terms of the libor act not later than days following its enactment the bancorps libor transition plan is organized around key work streams including continued engagement with central banks and industry working groups and regulators active client engagement comprehensive review of legacy documentation internal operational and technological readiness and risk management among other things to facilitate the transition to alternative reference rates although the full impact of libor reforms and actions remains unclear the bancorp has discontinued entering into new liborbased contracts in accordance with regulatory guidance except for permissible limited use as part of hedging and risk management programs during the fourth quarter of the bancorp expanded its offering of alternative reference rate products including sofr in addition the bancorp is continuing its transition of existing liborbased exposures to an appropriate alternative reference rate on or before june as of june the bancorp had substantial exposure to liborbased products throughout several of its lines of business these exposures included derivative contracts with a total notional value of approximately billion loans outstanding of approximately billion preferred stock of approximately billion and longterm debt of approximately million the bancorp currently estimates that approximately of the existing exposures will mature before june f or the contracts that will not mature prior to june an additional portion of these contracts is subject to contractual terms specifying alternative reference rates fallback provisions that would become effective upon cessation of libors publication existing exposures without fallback provisions are expected to be amended prior to june to include such terms or transition to an alternative reference rate or are expected to transition pursuant to the terms of the libor act and its related regulations for a further discussion of the various risks the bancorp faces in

additional information on each business segment is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp therefore the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing an ftp methodology the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits the ftp methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities respectively based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the assetgenerating and depositproviding businesses on a durationadjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other the charge and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets the ftp curve is constructed using the us swap curve brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminatelived deposits key assumptions including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts are reviewed annually credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions in general the charge rates on assets decreased throughout but have increased since december as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio the credit rates for deposit products also increased since december due to higher interest rates and modified assumptions thus net interest income for assetgenerating business segments was negatively impacted by the rates charged on assets while depositproviding business segments were positively impacted during the six months ended june the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for credit losses to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net chargeoffs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment provision for credit losses attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared

management framework and three lines of defense structure as well as key areas of risk which include credit risk liquidity risk interest rate risk price risk legal and regulatory compliance risk operational risk reputation risk and strategic risk item of the bancorps annual report on form 10k also includes additional detailed information about the bancorps processes related to operational risk management as well as legal and regulatory compliance risk management the following information should be read in conjunction with the bancorps annual report on form 10k credit risk management the objective of the bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the bancorp the bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles conservatism diversification and monitoring the bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below these practices include the use of intentional riskbased limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance the bancorp carefully designs and monitors underwriting documentation and collection standards the bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts the utilization of which is closely monitored underwriting activities are centrally managed and credit risk management manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly the credit risk review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation the accuracy of risk grades and the chargeoff nonaccrual and reserve analysis process the bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the acl is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio the bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio maintain an adequate acl and record any necessary chargeoffs the bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan refer to note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the bancorps credit grade categories which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions in addition stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models for certain portfolios such as real estate and leveraged lending stress testing is performed by credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting the following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases table potential problem portfolio loans and leases as of june in millions carrying value unpaid principal balance exposure commercial and industrial loans commercial mortgage loans commercial construction loans commercial leases total potential problem portfolio loans and leases table potential problem portfolio loans and leases as of december in millions carrying value unpaid principal balance exposure commercial and industrial loans commercial mortgage loans commercial construction loans commercial leases total potential problem portfolio loans and leases in addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems the first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems these ratings are used by the bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk the bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a throughthecycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrowers creditworthiness a throughthecycle rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance the dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued losses given an event of default the probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the tencategory regulatory risk rating system the bancorp utilizes internally developed models to estimate expected credit losses for portfolio loans and leases for loans and leases that are collectively evaluated the bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the bancorps annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional information about the bancorps processes for developing these models estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans for the commercial portfolio segment the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the throughthecycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions for loans with available credit the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions the estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions for collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments the bancorps expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrowers fico score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default the estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions the expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms such as residential mortgage loans and home equity and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges such as home equity the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions the bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios overview the first half of was defined by heightened volatility in financial markets as the frb indicated monetary policy would expeditiously return to a neutral policy setting and most likely move to a restrictive setting later in persistent inflation and federal reserve rate hikes weighed on financial market returns in the first half of as the sp declined and the bloomberg aggregate bond index fell commodities prices which had increased from the war in ukraine earlier in the year came under pressure in june as fears of an economic recession increased monetary policy makers are attempting to slow consumer and business demand for goods and services the persistence of inflation has led the fomc to raise rates at the most aggressive pace since the frb officials have indicated that they are more concerned about the risk of higher inflation becoming entrenched than the risk of pushing the economy into a recession consumer and business sentiment surveys softened throughout the first half of as the outlook for growth deteriorated due to higher inflation and geopolitical risks the dramatic increase in household wealth since march has supported consumer demand thus far however higher inflation is leading consumers to pull back on discretionary items as spending on essentials consumes more of their income with consumer demand beginning to slow businesses are facing a more challenging environment as profit margins come under pressure from higher inflation and decreasing demand for their products and services commercial portfolio the bancorps credit risk management strategy seeks to minimize concentrations of risk through diversification the bancorp has commercial loan concentration limits based on industry lines of business within the commercial segment geography and credit product type the risk within the commercial loan and lease portfolio is managed and monitored through an underwriting process utilizing detailed origination policies continuous loan level reviews monitoring of industry concentration and product type limits and continuous portfolio risk management reporting the bancorp is closely monitoring various economic conditions and their impacts on commercial borrowers including the pace of inflation rising interest rates labor and supply chain issues and changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns among others the bancorp maintains focus on disciplined client selection adherence to underwriting policy and attention to borrower and industry concentrations

consumer loan portfolio the bancorp does not update ltvs for the consumer portfolio subsequent to origination except as part of the chargeoff process for real estate secured loans the bancorp actively manages the consumer portfolio through concentration limits which mitigate credit risk through limiting the exposure to lower fico scores higher ltvs and specific geographic concentration risks the bancorp continues to ensure that underwriting standards and guidelines adequately account for the broader economic conditions that the consumer portfolio faces in a rising rate environment guidelines
