risk factors item the following is a change to the risk factors as previously disclosed in item of the registrants annual report on form 10k for the year ended december other than as set forth below there were no material changes to the risk factors disclosed in item of the registrants annual report on form 10k for the year ended december the covid19 pandemic creates significant risks and uncertainties for fifth thirds business in march the world health organization declared novel coronavirus disease covid19 a global pandemic the covid19 pandemic has negatively impacted the global economy disrupted global supply chains created significant volatility and disruption in financial markets and increased unemployment levels all of which may become heightened concerns upon subsequent waves of infection or future developments in addition the pandemic resulted in temporary closures of many businesses and the institution of social distancing and sheltering in place requirements in many states and communities including those in major markets in which the bancorp is located or does business as a result the demand for the bancorps products and services has been and is expected to continue to be significantly impacted furthermore the pandemic could influence the recognition of credit losses in the bancorps loan and lease portfolios and increase its allowance for credit losses as both businesses and consumers are negatively impacted by the economic downturn in addition governmental actions are meaningfully influencing the interestrate environment which could continue to adversely affect the bancorps results of operations and financial condition the business operations of subsidiaries of the bancorp such as fifth third bank national association have been and may also be disrupted in the future if significant portions of their workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions travel restrictions technology limitations andor disruptions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic furthermore the business operations of subsidiaries of the bancorp have been and may again in the future be disrupted due to vendors and third party service providers being unable to work or provide services effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic an increase in the remote work force due to the covid19 pandemic and the potential for a longterm change in fifth thirds remote work strategy may also increase risks related to cybersecurity and information security in response to the pandemic the bancorp provided financial hardship relief to borrowers that were negatively impacted by the pandemic and its related economic impacts these programs included payment deferrals and forbearances for both commercial and retail borrowers the bancorp has also temporarily suspended all residential foreclosure activity these actions are expected to negatively impact revenue and other results of operations of the bancorp in the near term and if not effective in mitigating the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the bancorps customers may adversely affect the bancorps business and results of operations more substantially over a longer period of time governmental authorities have taken significant measures to provide economic assistance to households and businesses to stabilize the markets and to support economic growth for example in response to the covid19 pandemic the frb and other us state and federal financial regulatory agencies took action to mitigate the resulting disruptions to economic activity and financial stability by implementing a number of facilities to provide emergency liquidity to various segments of the us economy and financial markets many of these facilities expired on or before december or were extended for brief periods into the expiration of these facilities could have an adverse effect on us economy and ultimately on the bancorps business among other relief programs the bancorp is a participating lender in the sbas paycheck protection program paycheck protection program loans are fixed unsecured low interest rate loans that are guaranteed by the sba and subject to numerous other regulatory requirements and a borrower may apply to have all or a portion of the loan forgiven if paycheck protection program borrowers fail to qualify for loan forgiveness the bancorp faces a heightened risk of holding these loans at unfavorable interest rates for an extended period of time while the paycheck protection program loans are guaranteed by the sba various regulatory requirements will apply to the bancorps ability to seek recourse under the guarantees and the related procedures are currently subject to uncertainty if a borrower defaults on a paycheck protection program loan these requirements and uncertainties may limit the bancorps ability to fully recover against the loan guarantee or to seek full recourse against the borrower these assistance efforts may adversely affect the bancorps revenue and results of operations and may make the bancorps results more difficult to forecast as the paycheck protection program forgiveness process has just begun and the timing and amount of forgiveness to which the bancorps borrowers will be entitled cannot be predicted the paycheck protection program and other government programs in which the bancorp may participate are complex and the bancorps participation may lead to governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity and damage to the bancorps reputation the extent to which the covid19 pandemic impacts the bancorps business results of operations and financial condition as well as its regulatory capital and liquidity ratios will depend on highly uncertain future developments including the scope and duration of the pandemic including the possibility of further surges of covid19 the timing and efficacy of the vaccination program in the us and further actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic government actions to mitigate the economic suffering caused by the covid19 pandemic may not be successful or may result in increased pressure on the banking sector which could adversely affect the bancorps business results of operations and financial condition more substantially over a longer period of time in addition the unique historical nature of the pandemic and the unprecedented level of governmental response may also significantly impact the bancorps ability to effectively manage its business or predict future performance as the covid19 pandemic subsides the us economy may require some time to fully recover from its effects the length of which is unknown the effects of the covid19 pandemic may heighten many of the other risks described in item risk factors of the bancorps annual report on form 10k and any subsequent quarterly report on form 10q or current report on form 8k including but not limited to risks of credit deterioration interest rate changes rating agency actions governmental actions market volatility theft fraud security breaches and technology interruptions
