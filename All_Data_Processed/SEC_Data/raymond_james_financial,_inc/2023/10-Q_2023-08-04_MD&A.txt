factors affecting forwardlooking statements certain statements made in this quarterly report on s with the securities and exchange commission the sec from time to time including our most recent annual report on sandreports within other reports and information banking operations our bank segment maintains an interestearning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash sbl ci loans cre loans reit loans and taxexempt loans as well as securities held in the availableforsale securities portfolio these interestearning assets are primarily funded by client deposits based on the current asset portfolio our banking operations are subject to interest rate risk we analyze interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of the asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit interest rate risk in our banking operations including scenario analysis and economic value of equity eve we utilize hedging strategies using interest rate swaps in our banking operations as a component of our asset and liability management process for further information regarding this hedging strategy see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of our form 10k and notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q to ensure that we remain within the tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios we use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12month time horizon assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement the slope of the yield curve and balance sheet composition and growth the model also considers interest raterelated risks such as pricing spreads pricing of client cash accounts including deposit betas and prepayments various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the following table is an analysis of our banking operations estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using our previously described assetliability model which assumes a dynamic balance sheet that the interest rates on substantially all of our deposits change by an amount equal to the change in market interest rates ie deposit beta of and that interest rates do not decline below zero while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longerterm impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis we test expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by the asset and liability committee instantaneous changes in rate net interest income in millions projected change in net interest income our 0basis point scenario was based on interest rates as of june and did not include the impact of the feds july increase in its benchmark shortterm rate the preceding table does not include the impacts of an instantaneous change in interest rates on net interest income on assets and liabilities outside of our banking operations or on our rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which are also sensitive to changes in interest rates and are included in account and service fees on our condensed consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income refer to managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations net interest analysis of this form

analysis of current interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities that incorporates all cash flows over their estimated remaining lives discounted at current rates the eve approach is based on a static balance sheet and provides an indicator of future earnings and capital levels as the changes in eve indicate the anticipated change in the value of future cash flows we monitor sensitivity to changes in eve utilizing board of directorsapproved limits these limits set a risk tolerance to changing interest rates and assist in determining strategies for mitigating this risk as eve approaches these limits as of june our eve analyses were within approved limits the following table shows the maturities of our bank loan portfolio at june including contractual principal repayments maturities are generally determined based upon contractual terms however rollovers or extensions that are included for the purposes of measuring the allowance for credit losses are reflected in

risk including how we manage such risk in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk of our form 10k corporate activities we maintain cash balances with the fed and with various financial institutions primarily global systemically important banks in our normal course of business a large portion of such balances are in excess of fdic insurance limits as a result we may be exposed to the risk that these financial institutions may not return our cash to us in the event that the institution experiences financial distress or ceases its operations in order to mitigate our credit risk to such financial institutions we monitor our exposure with each institution on a daily basis and subject each institution to limits based on various factors including but not limited to financial strength capitalization levels liquidity credit ratings and market factors to the extent applicable brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks exchanges clearing organizations and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations in addition certain commitments including underwritings may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument in addition we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security derivative and loan concentrations holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of our

performs assessments of compliance with credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information we seek to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses we utilize a thorough credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments for our residential mortgage loans and substantially all of our sbl we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance historical experience through various economic cycles industry or client concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs we determine the allowance required for specific loan pools based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements of our form 10k as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments see item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk of our form 10k for further information about the risk
