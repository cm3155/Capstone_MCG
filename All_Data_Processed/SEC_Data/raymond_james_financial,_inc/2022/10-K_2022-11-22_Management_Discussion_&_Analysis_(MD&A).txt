introduction the following managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda is intended to help the reader understand the results of our operations and financial condition this mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements where nm is used in various percentage change computations the computed percentage change has been determined to be not meaningful we operate as a financial holding company and bank holding company results in the businesses in which we operate are highly correlated to general economic conditions and more specifically to the direction of the us equity and fixed income markets changes in interest rates market volatility corporate and mortgage lending markets and commercial and residential credit trends overall market conditions economic political and regulatory trends and industry competition are among the factors which could affect us and which are unpredictable and beyond our control these factors affect the financial decisions made by market participants including investors borrowers and competitors impacting their level of participation in the financial markets these factors also impact the level of investment banking activity and asset valuations which ultimately affect our business results executive overview year ended september compared with the year ended september for the year ended september we generated net revenues of billion and pretax income of billion both higher compared with the prior year our net income available to common shareholders of billion was higher than the prior year and our earnings per diluted share of reflected a increase our return on common equity roce was compared with for the prior year in fiscal we completed the acquisitions of charles stanley group plc charles stanley tristate capital and sumridge partners which resulted in incremental revenues and expenses during the year during the year we also incurred acquisitionrelated expenses such as compensation largely related to retention awards initial provisions for credit losses on acquired loans and unfunded lending commitments amortization of identifiable intangible assets and other costs incurred to effect our acquisitions such as legal expenses and other professional fees these expenses totaled million this fiscal year an increase of million over the prior year excluding these acquisitionrelated expenses our adjusted net income available to common shareholders was billion an increase of compared with the prior year and our adjusted earnings per diluted share were an increase of adjusted roce for the year was compared with in the prior year and adjusted return on tangible common equity rotce was compared with in the prior year the increase in net revenues compared with the prior year was driven by the impact of higher pcg client assets in feebased accounts for most of the current fiscal year which positively impacted our asset management and related administrative fees the benefit of higher shortterm interest rates on both net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks and incremental revenues from our acquisitions of tristate capital charles stanley and sumridge partners brokerage revenues and investment banking revenues each declined compared with a strong prior year primarily as a result of market uncertainty during the current year compensation commissions and benefits expense increased primarily attributable to the growth in revenues and pretax income compared with the prior year as well as the aforementioned acquisitions our compensation ratio was compared with for the prior year excluding acquisitionrelated compensation expenses our adjusted compensation ratio was compared with for the prior year the decline in the compensation ratio primarily resulted from changes in our revenue mix due to higher net interest income and rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks which have little associated direct compensation adjusted net income available to common shareholders adjusted earnings per diluted share adjusted roce adjusted rotce and adjusted compensation ratio are nongaap financial measures in fiscal certain nongaap financial measures were adjusted for additional expenses directly related to our acquisitions that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results such as those related to amortization of identifiable intangible assets arising from acquisitions and acquisitionrelated retention prior periods have been conformed to the current presentation please see the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to gaap financial measures in this mda for a reconciliation of these nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap measures and for other important disclosures raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis noncompensation expenses increased due to incremental expenses from the aforementioned acquisitions as well as increases in the bank loan provision for credit losses business development expenses and communications and information processing expenses the bank loan provision for credit losses increased million to a provision of million in the current year compared with a benefit of million for the prior year however million of this increase related solely to the initial provision recorded on loans acquired as part of the tristate capital acquisition partially offsetting these increases we incurred million of losses on extinguishment of debt from the earlyredemption of certain of our senior notes during the prior year which did not recur in the current year our effective income tax rate was for fiscal an increase from for the prior year the increase in the effective tax rate from the prior year was primarily due to the negative impact of nondeductible valuation losses associated with our companyowned life insurance portfolio during the current year compared with nontaxable valuation gains for the prior year as of september our tier leverage ratio of and total capital ratio of were both well above the regulatory requirement to be considered wellcapitalized we also continued to have substantial liquidity with billion of cash at the parent company as of september which includes parent cash loaned to rja we believe our funding and capital position provide us the opportunity to continue to grow our balance sheet prudently and we expect to continue to be opportunistic in deploying our capital subsequent to the closing of tristate capital for the period june through september we repurchased million shares and subsequent to that date repurchased an additional thousand shares for a cumulative repurchase through november of approximately million shares of our common stock for million or approximately per share after the effect of those repurchases million remained under our board of directors share repurchase authorization we currently expect to continue to repurchase our common stock in fiscal to offset the impact of shares issued with the acquisition of tristate capital as well as to offset dilution from sharebased compensation however we will continue to monitor market conditions and other capital needs as we consider these repurchases on august the us enacted the inflation reduction act of which among other things establishes a excise tax on net repurchases of shares by domestic corporations whose stock is traded on an established securities market the excise tax will be imposed on repurchases that occur after december and will be recorded directly to equity as part of the repurchase transaction rather than as a component of our provision for income taxes the act also introduces a corporate alternative minimum tax which we do not expect to have an impact on our results of operations or cash flows in the future we believe we remain wellpositioned entering fiscal we expect fiscal results to be further positively impacted by a full years impact of the combined 300basis point increase in the feds shortterm benchmark interest rate during our fiscal as well as the 75basis point increase in november with clients domestic cash sweep balances of billion as of september and our high concentration of floatingrate assets we also believe we are wellpositioned for any further increases in shortterm interest rates which we expect to positively impact our net interest income and our rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks although we expect further declines in client cash balances in fiscal as we expect clients to continue to shift their cash to higheryielding investment products we also expect to continue to face macroeconomic uncertainties which may continue to have a negative impact on equity and fixed income markets as a result we may experience volatility in asset management fees and brokerage revenues as well as investment banking revenues despite our strong investment banking pipelines in addition asset management and related administrative fees will be negatively impacted in our fiscal first quarter of by the sequential decrease in pcg feebased assets as of september and lower financial assets under management however our recruiting pipelines remain strong and we continue to see solid retention of existing advisors net loan growth should result in additional provisions for credit losses and future economic deterioration could result in increased bank loan provisions for credit losses in future periods in addition although we remain focused on the management of expenses we expect that expenses will continue to increase in part as a result of inflationary pressures on our costs as business and eventrelated travel occur throughout the entire fiscal year and as we continue to make investments in our people and technology to support our growth year ended september compared with the year ended september refer to item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of our sandreports within other reports and information banking operations our bank segment maintains an interestearning asset portfolio that is comprised of cash sbl ci loans commercial and residential real estate loans reit loans and taxexempt loans as well as securities held in the availableforsale securities portfolio these interestearning assets are primarily funded by client deposits based on the current asset portfolio our banking operations are subject to interest rate risk we analyze interest rate risk based on forecasted net interest income which is the net amount of interest received and interest paid and the net portfolio valuation both across a range of interest rate scenarios one of the objectives of the asset and liability committee is to manage the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in market interest rates this committee uses several measures to monitor and limit interest rate risk in our banking operations including scenario analysis and economic value of equity we utilize a hedging strategy using interest rate swaps in our banking operations as a result of our asset and liability management process for further information regarding this hedging strategy see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k to ensure that we remain within the tolerances established for net interest income a sensitivity analysis of net interest income to interest rate conditions is estimated under a variety of scenarios we use simulation models and estimation techniques to assess the sensitivity of net interest income to movements in interest rates the model estimates the sensitivity by calculating interest income and interest expense in a dynamic balance sheet environment using current repricing prepayment and reinvestment of cash flow assumptions over a 12month time horizon assumptions used in the model include interest rate movement the slope of the yield curve and balance sheet composition and growth the model also considers interest raterelated risks such as pricing spreads pricing of client cash accounts and prepayments various interest rate scenarios are modeled in order to determine the effect those scenarios may have on net interest income raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the following table is an analysis of our banking operations estimated net interest income over a 12month period based on instantaneous shifts in interest rates expressed in basis points using our previously described assetliability model which assumes a dynamic balance sheet and that interest rates do not decline below zero while not presented additional rate scenarios are performed including interest rate ramps and yield curve shifts that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements we also perform simulations on time horizons of up to five years to assess longerterm impacts to various interest rate scenarios on a quarterly basis we test expected model results to actual performance additionally any changes made to key assumptions in the model are documented and approved by the asset and liability committee table start instantaneous changes in rate net interest income in millions projected change in net interest income table end our 0basis point scenario was based on interest rates as of september and did not include the impact of the feds november increase in

shortterm interest rates could have on the consolidated firms operations the following table shows the maturities of our bank loan portfolio at september including contractual principal repayments maturities are generally determined based upon contractual terms however rollovers or extensions that are included for the purposes of measuring the allowance for credit losses are reflected in

mortgage loan portfolio in our availableforsale securities portfolio we hold primarily fixedrate agencybacked mbs and agencybacked cmos which are carried at fair value on our consolidated statements of financial condition with changes in the fair value of the portfolio recorded through oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income at september our availableforsale securities portfolio had a fair value of billion with a weightedaverage yield of the effective duration of our availableforsale securities portfolio as of september was approximately where duration is defined as the approximate percentage change in price for a 100basis point change in rates see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on our availableforsale securities portfolio equity price risk we are exposed to equity price risk as a result of our capital markets activities our brokerdealer activities are generally clientdriven and we carry equity securities as part of our trading inventory to facilitate such activities although the amounts are not as significant as our fixed income trading inventory we attempt to reduce the risk of loss inherent in our inventory of equity securities by monitoring those security positions each day and establishing position limits equity securities held in our trading inventory are generally included in var in addition we have a private equity portfolio included in other investments on our consolidated statements of financial condition which is primarily comprised of investments in thirdparty funds see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on this portfolio foreign exchange risk we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our investments in foreign subsidiaries as well as transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar for example our bank loan portfolio includes loans which are denominated in canadian dollars totaling billion and billion at september and respectively when converted to the us dollar a majority of such loans are held in a canadian subsidiary of raymond james bank which is discussed in the following sections investments in foreign subsidiaries raymond james bank has an investment in a canadian subsidiary resulting in foreign exchange risk to mitigate its foreign exchange risk raymond james bank utilizes shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts these derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the consolidated financial statements see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding these derivatives at september we had foreign exchange risk in our investment in rj ltd of cad million and in our investment in charles stanley of million which were not hedged all of our other investments in subsidiaries located in europe are not hedged and we do not believe we had material foreign exchange risk either individually or in the aggregate pertaining to these subsidiaries as of september foreign exchange gainslosses related to our foreign investments are primarily reflected in oci on our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information regarding our components of oci transactions and resulting balances denominated in a currency other than the us dollar we are subject to foreign exchange risk due to our holdings of cash and certain other assets and liabilities resulting from transactions denominated in a currency other than the us dollar any currencyrelated gainslosses arising from these foreign currency denominated balances are reflected in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income the foreign exchange risk associated with a portion of such transactions and balances denominated in foreign currency are mitigated utilizing shortterm forward foreign exchange contracts such derivatives are not designated hedges and therefore the related gainslosses are included in other revenues in our consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for information regarding our derivatives raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis credit risk credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreedupon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks exchanges clearing organizations and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations in addition certain commitments including underwritings may create exposure to individual issuers and businesses the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument in addition we may be subject to concentration risk if we hold large positions in or have large commitments to a single counterparty borrower or group of similar counterparties or borrowers eg in the same industry we seek to mitigate these risks by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security derivative and loan concentrations holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our credit risk mitigation related to derivatives and collateralized agreements our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our determination of the allowance for credit losses associated with certain of our brokerage lending activities we offer loans to financial advisors for recruiting and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for further information about our loans to financial advisors banking activities our bank segment has a substantial loan portfolio our strategy for credit risk management related to bank loans includes welldefined credit policies uniform underwriting criteria and ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all credit exposures the strategy also includes diversification across loan types geographic location industry and client level regular credit examinations and management reviews of all corporate and taxexempt loans as well as individual delinquent residential loans the credit risk management process also includes annual independent reviews of the credit risk monitoring process that performs assessments of compliance with credit policies risk ratings and other critical credit information we seek to identify potential problem loans early record any necessary risk rating changes and chargeoffs promptly and maintain appropriate reserve levels for expected losses we utilize a thorough credit risk rating system to measure the credit quality of individual corporate and taxexempt loans and related unfunded lending commitments for our residential mortgage loans and substantially all of our sbl we utilize the credit risk rating system used by bank regulators in measuring the credit quality of each homogeneous class of loans in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance historical experience through various economic cycles industry or client concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs we determine the allowance required for specific loan pools based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis likewise the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows sbl loans in this segment are primarily collateralized by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards and to a lesser extent the cash surrender value of life insurance policies issued by an investmentgrade insurance company substantially all sbl are monitored daily for adherence to loantovalue ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status the vast majority of our sbl qualify for the practical expedient allowed under the cecl guidance whereby we estimate zero credit losses to the extent the fair value of the collateral securing the loan equals or exceeds the related carrying value of the loan sbl also generally qualify for lower capital requirements under regulatory capital rules ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on an ongoing basis this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which involve risks such as project budget overruns performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors or the inability to sell the project or secure permanent financing once the project is completed with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse information arising from any of these factors may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment reit loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance incomeproducing real estate across various property sectors this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types singlefamily residential including condominiums and land held for residential development within a range of markets deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business reductions in the value of real estate as well as increased vacancy and rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of the borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans we do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are also not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and the general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the level of chargeoff activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses the

september and respectively the level of nonperforming assets is another indicator of potential future credit losses nonperforming assets are comprised of both nonperforming loans and other real estate owned nonperforming loans include those loans which have been placed on nonaccrual status and certain accruing loans which are days or more past due and in the process of collection the following

million as of september and respectively of residential troubled debt restructurings which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of our bank segments assets remained low as of september any prolonged period of market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets an increase in our allowance for credit losses andor an increase in net chargeoffs in future periods although the extent would depend on future developments that are highly uncertain see further explanation of our bank loan

financial condition and results of operations results of operations bank of this form 10k loan underwriting policies a component of our bank segments credit risk management strategy is conservative welldefined policies and procedures our bank segments underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in the following sections sbl and residential mortgage loan portfolios our residential mortgage loan portfolio largely consists of first mortgage loans originated by us via referrals from our pcg financial advisors and the general public as well as first mortgage loans

senior bank executives approximately half of raymond james banks corporate borrowers are public companies a large portion of raymond james banks corporate loan portfolio is diversified among a number of industries in the us and canada and a large portion of these loans are to borrowers in industries in which we have expertise through coverage provided by our capital markets research analysts raymond james banks corporate loan portfolio is comprised of project finance real estate loans commercial lines of credit and term loans the majority of which are participations in shared national credit snc or other large syndicated loans raymond james bank is typically either involved in the syndication loans at inception or purchases loans in secondary trading markets the remainder of the corporate loan portfolio is comprised of smaller participations and direct loans there are no subordinated loans or mezzanine financings in the corporate loan portfolio raymond james banks taxexempt loans are longterm loans to governmental and nonprofit entities these loans generally have lower overall credit risk but are subject to other risks that are not usually present with corporate clients including the risk associated with the constituency served by a local government and the risk in ensuring an obligation has appropriate tax treatment tristate capital bank tristate capital banks

our personnel direct and actively monitor the servicers efforts through extensive communications regarding individual loan status changes and through requirements of timely and appropriate collection of property management actions and reporting including management of third parties used in the collection process eg appraisers attorneys etc residential mortgage loans over days past due are generally reviewed by our personnel monthly and documented in a written report detailing delinquency information balances collection status appraised value and other data points our senior management meets quarterly to discuss the status collection strategy and chargeoff recommendations on substantially all residential mortgage loan over days past due updated collateral valuations are generally obtained for loans over days past due and chargeoffs are typically taken on individual loans based on these valuations credit risk is also managed by diversifying the residential mortgage portfolio

of the loans which were still in their interestonly period at september begins amortizing is years corporate and taxexempt loans credit risk in our corporate and taxexempt loan portfolios is monitored on an individual loan basis for trends in borrower operating performance payment history credit ratings collateral performance loan covenant compliance semiannual snc exam results where applicable municipality demographics and other factors including industry performance and concentrations as part of the credit review process the loan rating is reviewed on an ongoing basis to confirm the appropriate risk rating for each credit the individual loan ratings resulting from the snc exams are incorporated in our internal loan ratings when the ratings are received if the snc rating is lower on an individual loan than our internal rating the loan is downgraded while we consider historical snc exam results in our loan ratings methodology differences between the snc exam and internal ratings on individual loans typically arise due to subjectivity of the loan classification process downgrades raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis resulting from these differences may result in additional provisions for credit losses in periods when snc exam results are received the majority of our taxexempt loan portfolio is comprised of loans to investmentgrade borrowers see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of this form 10k for additional information on our allowance for credit losses policies credit risk is managed by diversifying the corporate bank loan portfolio our corporate bank loan portfolio does not contain a significant concentration in any single industry the following table details the industry

disruptions and changes in consumer behavior in addition macroeconomic uncertainty and the ukraine conflict have further exacerbated supply chain stresses and inflation concerns in addition the feds measures to control inflation including through increases in shortterm interest rates have had an impact on consumer behavior and are likely to continue to do so in the nearterm these and related factors could negatively impact our borrowers particularly those in consumerfacing or supplydependent industries in addition we continue to monitor our exposure to office real estate where trends have

limited to business disruptions improper or unauthorized execution and processing of transactions deficiencies in our technology or financial operating systems and inadequacies or breaches in our control processes including cybersecurity incidents see item risk factors of this form 10k for a discussion of certain cybersecurity risks these risks are less direct than credit and market risk but managing them is critical particularly in a rapidly changing environment with increasing transaction volumes and complexity we operate different businesses in diverse markets and are reliant on the ability of our employees and systems to process a large number of transactions in the event of a breakdown or improper operation of systems or improper action by employees we could suffer financial loss regulatory sanctions and damage to our reputation in order to mitigate and control operational risk we have developed and continue to enhance specific policies and procedures that are designed to
