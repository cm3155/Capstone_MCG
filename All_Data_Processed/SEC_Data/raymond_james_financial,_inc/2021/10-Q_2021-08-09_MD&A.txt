derivatives are primarily accounted for as net investment hedges in the condensed consolidated financial statements see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements of our form 10k and note

adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreedupon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities see further discussion of our credit risk including how we manage such raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis risk in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk of our form 10k the initial decline in economic activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic caused increased credit risk particularly with regard to companies in sectors that were most significantly impacted by the economic disruption including energy airlines entertainment and leisure restaurants and gaming the speed and magnitude in which various sectors have recovered since the onset of the pandemic has been continually evolving given the stresses on certain of our clients liquidity we enhanced our credit monitoring activities with an increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk since the onset of the pandemic raymond james bank has enacted risk mitigation strategies including but not limited to the sale of loans in those sectors with a high likelihood of adverse impact arising from the pandemic we have also required collateral to be posted across our credit risk exposures in accordance with agreements with our borrowers and counterparties although economic conditions have generally improved we have maintained our increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss we offer loans to financial advisors and certain other key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us see notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for further information about our loans to financial advisors banking activities raymond james bank has a substantial loan portfolio while our bank loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy such as that experienced in our fiscal year as a result of the covid19 pandemic deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where we have a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs conversely should the economy recover at a faster pace than initially forecasted or the negative impact of the significant downtown event be less than originally projected the timing and magnitude of any decreases in required reserves for credit losses can be uncertain we determine the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis we evaluate our methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and make enhancements we consider appropriate our allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q as our bank loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which also look at other risks such as project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in any of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment reit loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance incomeproducing real estate across various property sectors this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types singlefamily residential including condominiums and land held for residential development within a range of markets deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business reductions in the value of real estate as well as increased vacancy and rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and the general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of our residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans we do not originate or purchase adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment sbl and other loans in this segment are collateralized generally by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status in evaluating credit risk we consider trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs our allowance for credit losses as of june was determined under the cecl model due to our october adoption of the new credit impairment standard see notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for further information our allowance for credit losses as well as our methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the allowance are regularly evaluated to determine if our methods and estimates continue to be appropriate for each class of loans with adjustments made on a quarterly basis several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for credit losses at june including loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings delinquency status collateral type and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments in addition the estimate of credit losses considered the relatively small amount of net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and the impact of the covid19 pandemic we also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors including commercial real estate and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio finally we considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio we continue to assess the impact of both the covid19 pandemic and the economic recovery therefrom as new information becomes available regarding the financial repercussions to our borrowers the risk ratings for individual loans will be updated and the allowance will be adjusted accordingly our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of bank loans held for investment was and at june october our cecl adoption date and september respectively during the three and nine months ended june we had a benefit for credit losses on our bank loan portfolio of million and million respectively raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis compared to a provision for credit losses of million and million for the three and nine months ended june respectively see further explanation of the credit loss provision increase in managements discussion and analysis results of operations raymond james bank of this form 10q and note in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for detail on the changes in our allowance for credit losses the level of chargeoff activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses the following table presents net loan chargeoffsrecoveries and the percentage of net loan chargeoffsrecoveries to the average outstanding loan balances by

june and september respectively although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of raymond james banks assets remained low as of june prolonged or further market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets an increase in our allowance for credit losses andor an increase in net chargeoffs in future periods although the extent will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain we have received requests from certain borrowers for forbearance which is generally a shortterm deferral of their loan payments or modification of certain covenant terms driven or exacerbated by the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic based on the amortized costs approximately million and million of our corporate and residential loans respectively were in active forbearance as of june as certain borrowers exit forbearance we have received requests for loan modifications including repayment plans in accordance with the cares act and the consolidated appropriations act we are not applying tdr classification to any covid19 related loan modifications performed from march through december to borrowers who were current as of december as of june we had residential loans of million for which the borrower had requested a loan modification where the request had been initiated but not completed or approved as the delinquency status is not affected for loans that are in active forbearance or for loan raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis modifications that have not yet been approved the recognition of chargeoffs delinquencies and nonaccrual status could be delayed for those borrowers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status forbearance and modification requests have continued to decline and the majority of the borrowers that have exited forbearance but have not requested loan modifications have become current on their principal and interest payments loan underwriting policies our underwriting policies for the major types of bank loans are described in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk of our form 10k there were no material changes in our bank loan underwriting policies during the nine months ended june risk monitoring process another component of credit risk strategy for our bank loan portfolio is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential sbl corporate and taxexempt credit exposures as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies there are various other factors included in these processes depending on the loan portfolio there were no material changes to those processes and policies during the nine months ended june residential mortgage and sbl and other loan portfolios the collateral securing our sbl and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure our loans are adequately secured resulting in minimizing its credit risk collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date we track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in our residential mortgage loan portfolio the factors include but are not limited to loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores level of documentation loan purpose

credit limits related to sectors that we believe to be most vulnerable to the covid19 pandemic such as the energy airlines entertainment and leisure restaurant and gaming sectors we may experience further losses on our remaining loans to borrowers in these sectors particularly if economic conditions do not continue to improve in the future in addition we continue to monitor our exposure to office real estate where trends have changed rapidly and possibly permanently as a result of the covid19 pandemic and may experience additional losses on loans in this sector in the future we may also experience further losses on corporate loans in other industries as a direct or indirect result of the pandemic including on our cre loans secured by retail and hospitality properties although we saw deterioration in oil prices for much of fiscal year due to the pandemic oil prices continued to improve during the first nine months of fiscal year and have now surpassed prepandemic levels as of the end of the fiscal third quarter of our energy portfolio has minimal direct commodity price exposure since it consists of loans to midstream distribution companies and convenience stores with no loans
