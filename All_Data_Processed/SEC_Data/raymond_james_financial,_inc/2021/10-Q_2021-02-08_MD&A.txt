credit risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in a borrowers issuers or counterpartys ability to meet its financial obligations under contractual or agreed upon terms the nature and amount of credit risk depends on the type of transaction the structure and duration of that transaction and the parties involved credit risk is an integral component of the profit assessment of lending and other financing activities see further discussion of our credit risk including how we manage such risk in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk of our form 10k raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the decline in economic activity as a result of the covid19 pandemic has caused increased credit risk in general and particularly with regard to companies in sectors that have been most significantly impacted by the economic disruption including energy airlines entertainment and leisure restaurants and gaming given the stresses on certain of our clients liquidity we enhanced our credit monitoring activities with an increased focus on monitoring our credit exposures and counterparty credit risk since the onset of the pandemic rj bank has enacted risk mitigation strategies including but not limited to the sale of loans in those sectors with a high likelihood of adverse impact arising from the pandemic we have also required collateral to be posted across our credit risk exposures in accordance with agreements with our borrowers and counterparties brokerage activities we are engaged in various trading and brokerage activities in which our counterparties primarily include brokerdealers banks and other financial institutions we are exposed to risk that these counterparties may not fulfill their obligations the risk of default depends on the creditworthiness of the counterparty andor the issuer of the instrument we manage this risk by imposing and monitoring individual and aggregate position limits within each business segment for each counterparty conducting regular credit reviews of financial counterparties reviewing security and loan concentrations holding and calculating the fair value of collateral on certain transactions and conducting business through clearing organizations which may guarantee performance our client activities involve the execution settlement and financing of various transactions on behalf of our clients client activities are transacted on either a cash or margin basis credit exposure results from client margin loans which are monitored daily and are collateralized by the securities in the clients accounts we monitor exposure to industry sectors and individual securities and perform analysis on a daily basis in connection with our margin lending activities we adjust our margin requirements if we believe our risk exposure is not appropriate based on market conditions in addition when clients execute a purchase we are at some risk that the client will default on their financial obligation associated with the trade if this occurs we may have to liquidate the position at a loss we offer loans to financial advisors and certain other key revenue producers primarily for recruiting transitional cost assistance and retention purposes we have credit risk and may incur a loss primarily in the event that such borrower is no longer affiliated with us see notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for further information about our loans to financial advisors banking activities rj bank has a substantial loan portfolio while rj banks loan portfolio is diversified a significant downturn in the overall economy such as that experienced in our fiscal year as a result of the covid19 pandemic deterioration in real estate values or a significant issue within any sector or sectors where rj bank has a concentration will generally result in large provisions for credit losses andor chargeoffs rj bank determines the allowance required for specific loan grades based on relative risk characteristics of the loan portfolio on an ongoing basis rj bank evaluates its methods for determining the allowance for each class of loans and makes enhancements it considers appropriate rj banks allowance for credit losses methodology is described in note of the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q as rj banks loan portfolio is segregated into six portfolio segments likewise the allowance for credit losses is segregated by these same segments the risk characteristics relevant to each portfolio segment are as follows ci loans in this segment are made to businesses and are generally secured by all assets of the business repayment is expected from the cash flows of the respective business unfavorable economic and political conditions including the resultant decrease in consumer or business spending may have an adverse effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment cre loans in this segment are primarily secured by incomeproducing properties for owneroccupied properties the cash flows are derived from the operations of the business and the underlying cash flows may be adversely affected by the deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business the underlying cash flows generated by nonowneroccupied properties may be adversely affected by increased vacancy and rental rates which are monitored on a quarterly basis this portfolio segment includes cre construction loans which also look at other risks such as project budget overruns and performance variables related to the contractor and subcontractors with respect to commercial construction of residential developments there is also the risk that the builder has a geographical concentration of developments adverse developments in any of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis reit loans in this segment are made to businesses that own or finance incomeproducing real estate across various property sectors this portfolio segment may include extensions of credit to companies that engage in real estate development repayment of these loans is dependent on income generated from real estate properties or the sale of real estate a portion of this segment may consist of loans secured by residential product types singlefamily residential including condominiums and land held for residential development within a range of markets deterioration in the financial condition of the operating business reductions in the value of real estate as well as increased vacancy and rental rates may all adversely affect the loans in this segment taxexempt loans in this segment are made to governmental and nonprofit entities and are generally secured by a pledge of revenue and in some cases by a security interest in or a mortgage on the asset being financed for loans to governmental entities repayment is expected from a pledge of certain revenues or taxes for nonprofit entities repayment is expected from revenues which may include fundraising proceeds these loans are subject to demographic risk therefore much of the credit assessment of taxexempt loans is driven by the entitys revenue base and general economic environment adverse developments in either of these areas may have a negative effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment residential mortgage includes home equity loanslines all of rj banks residential mortgage loans adhere to stringent underwriting parameters pertaining to credit score and credit history debttoincome ratio of borrower ltv and combined ltv including second mortgagehome equity loans rj bank does not originate or purchase option adjustable rate mortgage arm loans with negative amortization reverse mortgages or loans to subprime borrowers loans with deeply discounted teaser rates are not originated or purchased all loans in this segment are collateralized by residential real estate and repayment is primarily dependent on the credit quality of the individual borrower a decline in the strength of the economy particularly unemployment rates and housing prices among other factors could have a significant effect on the credit quality of loans in this segment sbl and other loans in this segment are collateralized generally by the borrowers marketable securities at advance rates consistent with industry standards these loans are monitored daily for adherence to ltv guidelines and when a loan exceeds the required ltv a collateral call is issued past due loans are minimal as any past due amounts result in a notice to the client for payment or the potential sale of the collateral which will bring the loan to a current status in evaluating credit risk rj bank considers trends in loan performance the level of allowance coverage relative to similar banking institutions industry or customer concentrations the loan portfolio composition and macroeconomic factors both current and forecasted these factors have a potentially negative impact on loan performance and net chargeoffs our allowance for credit losses as of december was determined under the cecl model due to our october adoption of the new credit impairment standard see notes and of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for further information our allowance for credit losses as well as our methodologies and assumptions used in estimating the allowance are regularly evaluated to determine if our methods and estimates continue to be appropriate for each class of loans with adjustments made on a quarterly basis several factors were taken into consideration in evaluating the allowance for credit losses at december including loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings delinquency status collateral type and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments in addition the estimate of credit losses considered the lack of net chargeoffs during the period the level of nonperforming loans and the impact of the covid19 pandemic rj bank also considered the uncertainty related to certain industry sectors including commercial real estate and the extent of credit exposure to specific borrowers within the portfolio finally rj bank considered current economic conditions that might impact the portfolio we will continue to assess the impact of the covid19 pandemic and as more information becomes available regarding the financial repercussions to our borrowers the risk ratings for individual loans will be updated and the allowance will be adjusted accordingly rj banks allowance for credit losses as a percentage of bank loans held for investment was and at december and september respectively see note in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for detail on the changes in rj banks allowance for credit losses the bank loan provision for credit losses for the three months ended december was million compared to a benefit for credit losses of million for the prioryear quarter see further explanation of the credit loss provision increase in managements discussion and analysis results of operations rj bank of this form 10q the level of chargeoff activity is a factor that is considered in evaluating the potential severity of future credit losses see note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for additional information on chargeoffs raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis the level of nonperforming loans is another indicator of potential future credit losses the following table presents the nonperforming loans balance and total allowance for credit losses for the periods presented december september in millions nonperforming loan balance allowance for credit losses balance nonperforming loan balance allowance for credit losses balance ci loans cre loans reit loans taxexempt loans residential mortgage loans sbl and other total nonperforming loans held for investment total nonperforming loans as a of rj bank total loans included in nonperforming residential mortgage loans as of december were million in loans for which million in chargeoffs were previously recorded resulting in less exposure within the remaining balance see note in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for loan categories as a percentage of total loans receivable the nonperforming loan balances in the preceding table exclude million as of both december and september of residential tdrs which were returned to accrual status in accordance with our policy total nonperforming assets including the nonperforming loans in the preceding table and other real estate acquired in the settlement of residential mortgages amounted to million and million at december and september respectively total nonperforming assets as a percentage of rj bank total assets were and at december and september respectively although our nonperforming assets as a percentage of rj bank assets remained low as of december prolonged or further market deterioration could result in an increase in our nonperforming assets an increase in our allowance for credit losses andor an increase in net chargeoffs in future periods although the extent will depend on future developments that are highly uncertain we have received requests from certain borrowers for forbearance which is generally a shortterm deferral of their loan payments to us driven or exacerbated by the economic impacts of the covid19 pandemic certain borrowers have also requested modifications of covenant terms and repayment plans in accordance with the cares act and the consolidated appropriations act we have elected to not apply tdr classification to any covid19 related loan modifications that were performed after march to borrowers who were current as of december based on the amortized costs as of the end of december we have active payment deferrals on approximately million and million of our corporate and residential loans respectively such deferrals could delay the recognition of chargeoffs delinquencies and nonaccrual status for these borrowers who would have otherwise moved into past due or nonaccrual status modification requests have continued to decline and a majority of the borrowers that have exited forbearance have become current on their principal and interest payments loan underwriting policies rj banks underwriting policies for the major types of loans are described in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations risk management credit risk of our form 10k there were no material changes in rj banks underwriting policies during the three months ended december risk monitoring process another component of credit risk strategy at rj bank is the ongoing risk monitoring and review processes for all residential sbl corporate and taxexempt credit exposures as well as our rigorous processes to manage and limit credit losses arising from loan delinquencies there are various other factors included in these processes depending on the loan portfolio there were no material changes to those processes and policies during the three months ended december residential mortgage and sbl and other loan portfolios the collateral securing rj banks sbl and other portfolio is monitored on a recurring basis with marketable collateral monitored on a daily basis collateral adjustments are made by the borrower as necessary to ensure rj banks loans are raymond james financial inc and subsidiaries managements discussion and analysis adequately secured resulting in minimizing its credit risk collateral calls have been minimal relative to our sbl and other portfolio with no losses incurred to date we track and review many factors to monitor credit risk in rj banks residential mortgage loan portfolio the factors include but are not limited to loan performance trends loan product parameters and qualification requirements borrower credit scores level of documentation loan purpose geographic concentrations average loan size risk rating and ltv ratios see note in the notes to the condensed consolidated financial statements of this form 10q for additional information the following table presents a summary of delinquent residential mortgage loans the vast majority of which are first mortgage loans which are comprised of loans which are two or more payments past due as well as loans in the process of foreclosure amounts in the following table do not include residential loans to borrowers who have been granted forbearance as a result of the covid19 pandemic and whose loans were not considered delinquent prior to the forbearance such loans may be considered delinquent after the forbearance period depending on their payment status as a result the amount of residential loans considered delinquent may increase significantly when the forbearance periods expire amount of delinquent residential loans delinquent residential loans as a percentage of outstanding loan balances in millions

managements discussion and analysis the covid19 pandemic negatively impacted our corporate loan portfolio in fiscal and could do so again in the future although we have reduced our exposure and revised our credit limits related to sectors that we believe to be most vulnerable to the covid19 pandemic such as the energy airlines entertainment and leisure restaurant and gaming sectors we may experience further losses on our remaining loans to borrowers in these sectors particularly if economic conditions deteriorate in addition we continue to monitor our exposure to office real estate where trends have changed rapidly and possibly permanently as a result of the covid19 pandemic and may experience additional losses on loans in this sector in the future we may also experience further losses on corporate loans in other industries as a direct or indirect result of the pandemic including on our cre loans secured by retail and hospitality properties although we saw deterioration in oil prices for much of fiscal year due to the pandemic and prices continued to be below prepandemic levels during the fiscal first quarter of our energy portfolio has minimal direct commodity price exposure since it consists of loans to midstream distribution companies and convenience stores with no loans to exploration and production enterprises however if we continue to see a significant deterioration in oil prices our borrowers and as a result our loans to such clients could be negatively impacted in the future liquidity risk see the section managements discussion and analysis of
