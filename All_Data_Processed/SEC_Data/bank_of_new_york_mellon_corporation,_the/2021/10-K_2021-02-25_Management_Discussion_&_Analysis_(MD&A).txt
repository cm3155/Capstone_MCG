basis of accounting rather than the generally accepted accounting principles gaap used for consolidated financial reporting these measurement principles are designed so that reported results of the

types of revenue by line of business and how our business segments are presented and analyzed see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements business segment results are subject to reclassification when organizational changes are made or for refinements in revenue and expense allocation methodologies refinements are typically reflected on a prospective basis the results of our business segments may be influenced by client and other activities that vary by quarter in the first quarter staff expense typically increases reflecting the vesting of longterm stock bny mellon awards for retirementeligible employees in the third quarter staff expense typically increases reflecting the annual employee merit increase in the third quarter depositary receipts revenue is typically higher due to an increased level of client dividend payments and volumerelated fees may decline due to reduced client activity in the fourth quarter we typically incur higher business development and marketing expenses however was an exception due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic in our investment and wealth management business segment performance fees are typically higher in the fourth and first quarters as those quarters represent the end of the measurement period for many of the performance feecligible relationships the results of our business segments may also be impacted by the translation of financial results denominated in foreign currencies to the us dollar we are primarily impacted by activities denominated in the british pound and the euro on a consolidated basis and in our securities services and market and wealth services business segments we typically have more foreign currencydenominated expenses than revenues however our investment and wealth management business segment typically has more foreign currencydenominated revenues than expenses overall currency fluctuations impact the yearoveryear growth rate in the investment and wealth

by product type the overall level of aum for a given period is determined by the beginning level of aum the net flows of new assets during the period resulting from new business wins and existing client inflows reduced by the loss of clients and existing client outflows and the impact of market price appreciation or depreciation foreign exchange rates and investment firm acquisitions or divestitures the mix of aum is a result of the historical growth rates of equity and fixed income markets and the cumulative net flows of our investment firms as a result of client asset allocation decisions actively managed equity multiasset and alternative assets typically generate higher percentage fees than fixed income and liabilitydriven investments and cash also actively managed assets typically generate higher management fees than indexed or passively managed assets of the same type market and regulatory trends have resulted in increased demand for lower fee asset management products and for performancebased fees investment management fees are dependent on the overall level and mix of aum and the management fees expressed in basis points onehundredth of one percent charged for managing those assets management fees are typically subject to fee schedules based on the overall level of assets managed for a single client or by individual asset class and style this is most common for institutional clients where we typically manage substantial assets for individual accounts performance fees are generally calculated as a percentage of a portfolios performance in excess of a benchmark index or a peer groups performance a key driver of organic growth in investment management and performance fees is the amount of net new aum flows overall market conditions are

our significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements certain of these policies include critical accounting estimates which require management to make subjective or complex judgments about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods our critical accounting estimates are those related to the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangibles and litigation and regulatory contingencies management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting estimates with the companys audit committee allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses covers financial assets subject to credit losses and measured at amortized cost including loans and lendingrelated commitments heldtomaturity securities certain securities financing transactions and deposits with banks the allowance for credit losses is intended to adjust the carrying value of these assets by an estimated amount of credit losses that we expect to incur over the life of the asset similarly the allowance for credit losses on lendingrelated commitments and other offbalance sheet financial instruments is meant to capture the credit losses that we expect to recognize in these portfolios as of the balance sheet date a quantitative methodology and qualitative framework is used to estimate the allowance for credit losses the quantitative component of our estimate uses models and methodologies that categorize financial assets based on product type collateral type and other credit trends and risk characteristics including relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability of the recorded amounts for the quantitative component we segment portfolios into various major components including commercial loans and lease financing commercial real estate financial institutions residential mortgages and other the segmentation of our debt securities portfolios is by major asset class and is influenced by whether the security is structured or nonstructured ie direct obligation as well as the issuer type the components of the credit loss calculation for each major portfolio or asset class include a probability of default loss given default and exposure at default as applicable and their values depend on the forecast behavior of variables in the macroeconomic environment we utilize a multiscenario macroeconomic forecast which includes a weighting of three scenarios a baseline and upside and downside scenarios and allows us to develop our estimate using a wide span of economic variables our baseline scenario reflects a view on likely performance of each global region and the other two scenarios are designed relative to the baseline scenario this approach incorporates a reasonable and supportable forecast period spanning the life of the asset and this period includes both an initial estimated economic outlook component as well as a reversion component for each economic input variable the length of each of the two components depends on the underlying financial instrument scenario and underlying economic input variable in general the initial economic outlook period for each economic input variable under each scenario ranges between several months and two years the speed at which the scenariospecific forecasts revert to long term historical mean is based on observed historical patterns of mean reversion at the economic variable input level that are reflected in our model parameter estimates certain macroeconomic variables such as unemployment or home prices take longer to revert after a contraction though specific recovery times are scenariospecific reversion will usually take longer the further away the scenariospecific forecast is from the historical mean on a quarterly basis and within a developed governance structure we update these scenarios for current economic conditions and may adjust the scenario weighting based on our economic outlook the company uses its best judgment to assess these economic conditions and loss data in estimating the allowance for credit losses and these estimates are subject to periodic refinement based on changes to underlying external or companyspecific historical data in the quantitative component of our estimate we measure expected credit losses using an individual evaluation method if the risk characteristics of the asset is no longer consistent with the portfolio or class of asset for these assets we do not employ the macroeconomic model calculation but consider factors such as payment status collateral value the obligors financial condition guarantor support the probability of collecting scheduled principal and bny mellon results of operations continued interest payments when due and recovery expectations if they can be reasonably estimated for loans we measure the expected credit loss as the difference between the amortized cost basis in the loan and the present value of the expected future cash flows from the borrower which is generally discounted at the loans effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent we generally consider nonperforming loans as well as loans that have been or are anticipated to be modified and classified under a troubled debt restructuring for individual evaluation given the risk characteristics of such loans availableforsale debt securities are recorded at fair value when an availableforsale debt security is in an unrealized loss position we employ a methodology to identify and estimate the credit loss portion of the unrealized loss position the measurement of expected credit losses is performed at the security level and is based on our best single estimate of cash flows on a discounted basis however we do not specifically employ the macroeconomic forecasting models and scenarios summarized above the qualitative component of our estimate for the allowance for credit losses is intended to capture expected losses that may not have been fully captured in the quantitative component through an established governance structure management determines the qualitative allowance each period based on an evaluation of various internal and environmental factors which include scenario weighting and sensitivity risk credit concentration risk economic conditions and other considerations we have made and may continue to make adjustments for idiosyncratic risks to the extent actual results differ from forecasts or managements judgment the allowance for credit losses may be greater or less than future chargeoffs and recoveries our allowance for credit losses is sensitive to a number of inputs most notably the credit ratings assigned to each borrower as well as macroeconomic forecast assumptions that are incorporated in our estimate of credit losses through the expected life of the loan portfolio thus as the macroeconomic environment and related forecasts change the allowance for credit losses may change materially the following sensitivity analyses do not represent bny mellon managements expectations of the deterioration of our portfolios or the economic environment but are provided as hypothetical scenarios to assess the sensitivity of the allowance for credit losses to changes in key inputs if commercial real estate property values were increased and all other credits were rated one grade better the quantitative allowance would have decreased by million and if commercial real estate property values were decreased and all other credits were rated one grade worse the quantitative allowance would have increased by million our multiscenario based macroeconomic forecast used in determining the dec allowance for credit losses consisted of three scenarios the baseline scenario reflects flat gdp growth continued moderate labor market recovery and stable commercial real estate prices through mid2022 that begin to increase in the second half of the upside scenario reflects faster gdp growth and labor market recovery and higher commercial real estate prices compared with the baseline the downside scenario contemplates negative gdp growth throughout the first quarter of and subsequent stabilization throughout as well as increasing unemployment throughout and lower commercial real estate prices than the baseline throughout we placed the most weight on our baseline scenario with the remaining weighting resulting in slightly more weight placed on the downside scenario than the upside scenario from a sensitivity perspective at dec if we had applied weighting to the downside scenario the quantitative allowance for credit losses would have been approximately million higher goodwill and other intangibles we initially record all assets and liabilities acquired in purchase acquisitions including goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other intangibles in accordance with accounting standards codification asc business combinations goodwill indefinitelived intangibles and other intangibles are subsequently accounted for in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other the initial measurement of goodwill and intangibles requires judgment concerning estimates of the fair value of the acquired assets and liabilities goodwill billion at dec and indefinitelived intangible assets billion at dec are not amortized but are subject to tests for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate it is more likely than not they may be results of operations continued impaired other intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are subject to impairment if events or circumstances indicate a possible inability to realize the carrying value bny mellons business segments include six reporting units for which annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in accordance with asc intangibles goodwill and other the goodwill impairment test compares the estimated fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired however if the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed its estimated fair value an impairment loss would be recorded a substantial goodwill impairment charge would not have a significant impact on our financial condition or our regulatory capital ratios but would have an adverse impact on our results of operations in addition due to regulatory restrictions the companys subsidiary banks could be restricted from distributing available cash to the parent resulting in the parent needing to issue additional longterm debt in the second quarter of we performed our annual goodwill impairment test on all six reporting units using an income approach to estimate the fair values of each reporting unit estimated cash flows used in the income approach were based on managements projections as of march the discount rate applied to these cash flows was and incorporated a market equity risk premium estimated cash flows extend far into the future and by their nature are difficult to estimate over such an extended time frame as a result of the annual goodwill impairment test of the six reporting units no goodwill impairment was recognized the fair values of all six of the companys reporting units were substantially in excess of the respective reporting units carrying value the investment management reporting unit with billion of allocated goodwill which is one of the two reporting units in the investment and wealth management segment exceeded its carrying value by approximately for the investment management reporting unit in the future small changes in the assumptions such as the discount rate changes in the level or mix of aum and operating margin could produce a noncash goodwill impairment key judgments in accounting for intangibles include useful life and classification between goodwill and indefinitelived intangibles or other intangibles requiring amortization indefinitelived intangible assets are evaluated for impairment at least annually by comparing their fair values estimated using discounted cash flow analyses to their carrying values other amortizing intangible assets million at dec are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment such evaluation of other intangible assets would be initially based on undiscounted cash flow projections see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding goodwill intangible assets and the annual and interim impairment testing litigation and regulatory contingencies significant estimates and judgments are required in establishing an accrued liability for litigation and regulatory contingencies for additional information on our policy see legal proceedings in note of the notes to

primary market risk is exposure to movements in us dollar interest rates and certain foreign currency interest rates we actively manage interest rate sensitivity and use earnings simulation and discounted cash flow models to identify interest rate exposures an earnings simulation model is the primary tool used to assess changes in pretax net interest revenue between a baseline scenario and hypothetical interest rate scenarios interest rate sensitivity is quantified by calculating the change in pretax net interest revenue between the scenarios over a 12month measurement period the baseline scenario incorporates the markets forward rate expectations and managements assumptions regarding client deposit rates credit spreads changes in the prepayment behavior of loans and securities and the impact of derivative financial instruments used for interest rate risk management purposes as of dec these assumptions have been developed through a combination of historical analysis and future expected pricing behavior and are inherently uncertain actual results may differ materially from projected results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and managements strategies among other factors client deposit levels and mix are key assumptions impacting net interest revenue in the baseline as well as the hypothetical interest rate scenarios the earnings simulation model assumes static deposit levels and mix and it also assumes that no management actions will be taken to mitigate the effects of interest rate changes typically the baseline scenario uses the average deposit balances of the quarter in the table below we use the earnings simulation model to assess the impact of various hypothetical interest rate scenarios compared to the baseline scenario beginning in the third quarter of we have refined our scenario analysis by replacing gradual rate ramp scenarios with scenarios that reflect the impact of instantaneous interest rate shock movements in each of the new scenarios all currencies interest rates are instantaneously shifted higher or lower the scenarios assume instantaneous rate changes at the start of the forecast longterm interest rates are defined as all tenors equal to or greater than three years and shortterm interest rates results of operations continued are defined as all tenors equal to or less than three months interim term points are interpolated where applicable the refined scenarios are intended to provide information on a basis that is consistent with industry practice the following table shows net interest revenue sensitivity for bny mellon the sensitivity for dec has been updated to reflect the impact of instantaneous interest rate shock movements estimated changes in net interest revenue dec sept dec in millions up bps rate shock vs baseline longterm up bps short term unchanged shortterm up bps long term unchanged longterm down bps short term unchanged down bp rate shock vs baseline the decreases in the rising rate sensitivities compared with sept are driven by the forecasted difference in asset yield changes versus deposit rate changes given the anticipated interest rate increases and higher net interest revenue in the baseline scenario while the net interest revenue sensitivity scenario calculations assume static deposit balances to facilitate consistent periodoverperiod comparisons it is likely that a portion of the recent monetary policydriven deposit inflows would run off ina rising shortterm rate environment noninterest bearing deposits are particularly sensitive to changes in shortterm rates to illustrate the net interest revenue sensitivity to deposit runoff we note that a billion instantaneous reduction of us dollar denominated noninterestbearing deposits would reduce the net interest revenue sensitivity results in the up basis point scenario in the table above by approximately million the impact would be smaller if the run off was assumed to be a mixture of interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits additionally given the continued low shortterm interest rates money market mutual fund fees and other similar fees are being waived to protect investors from negative returns see fee and other revenue for additional details on the impact of money market fee waivers for a discussion of factors impacting the growth or contraction of deposits see risk factors capital and liquidity risk our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not effectively manage our liquidity we also project future cash flows from our assets and liabilities over a longterm horizon and then discount these cash flows using instantaneous parallel shocks to prevailing interest rates this measure reflects the structural balance sheet interest rate sensitivity by discounting all future cash flows the aggregation of these discounted cash flows is the economic value of equity eve the following table shows how eve would change in response to changes in interest rates estimated changes in eve dec rate change up bps vs baseline up bps vs baseline the asymmetrical accounting treatment of the impact of a change in interest rates on our balance sheet may create a situation in which an increase in interest rates can adversely affect reported equity and regulatory capital even though economically there may be no impact on our economic capital position for example an increase in rates will result in a decline in the value of our availableforsale securities portfolio in this example there is no corresponding change on our fixed liabilities even though economically these liabilities are more valuable as rates rise these results do not reflect strategies that management could employ to limit the impact as interest rate expectations change to manage foreign exchange risk we fund foreign currencydenominated assets with liability instruments denominated in the same currency we utilize various foreign exchange contracts if a liability denominated in the same currency is not available or desired and to minimize the earnings impact of translation gains or losses created by investments in foreign markets we use forward foreign exchange contracts to protect the value of our net investment in foreign
