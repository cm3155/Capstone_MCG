item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition at march and december and our results of operations for the three months ended march and the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about our financial condition and results of operations which is not otherwise apparent from our consolidated financial statements the following discussion and analysis should be read along with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere herein and the risk factors discussed in part ii item risk factors herein as well as our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december form 10k and the other reports we have filed with the securities and exchange commission since we filed that form 10k impact of covid19 pandemic the outbreak and spread of a novel strain of the coronavirus or covid19 has created a global public health crisis that has resulted in unprecedented uncertainty volatility and disruption in financial markets and in governmental commercial and consumer activity in the united states and globally including the markets that we serve these actions included the decision by the federal reserve open markets committee to lower the target for the federal funds rate to a range of between zero to on march this action followed a prior reduction of the targeted federal funds rate to a range of to on march we have been intentional in our response to the covid19 pandemic to ensure strength in our balance sheet including initially increases in liquidity and reserves as a part of this intentional response we conducted an extensive loan review and rerisk grading process in during the second quarter of we performed an indepth review of all riskgraded loans greater than million for which we had granted the borrower the ability to defer the payment of principal andor interest for a period of up to days following the covid19 outbreak we also performed an indepth review of all of our hotel and retail commercial real estate loans greater than million regardless of their receipt of deferral during the third quarter of our focus broadened to include the other segments of the portfolio that are risk rated that we did not rerisk grade during the second quarter this extensive reunderwriting effort included our pass grade loans with exposures greater than million and watch list criticized or classified loans with exposures greater than during the fourth quarter of and again in the first quarter of we performed a followup indepth review of hotel loans million and greater all nonpass grade exposures greater than and a comprehensive review of loans with a low pass risk grade known to be impacted by the covid19 pandemic additionally throughout and into in response to the pandemic we have continued to adjust our business practices including restricting employee travel encouraging employees to work from home where possible offering until recently drivethru only service at certain of our locations with specific needs facilitated by appointment implementing social distancing guidelines within our offices and continuing to hold regular meetings of our pandemic response team many of these measures remain in place due to the continued prevalence of the virus though in april we began reopening our customer locations and bringing employees back into the office with a phased approach on march the coronavirus aid relief and economic security cares act was signed into law it contains substantial tax and spending provisions intended to address the impact of the covid19 pandemic the cares act included the paycheck protection program ppp a program designed to aid small and mediumsized businesses sole proprietors and other selfemployed persons through federally guaranteed loans distributed through banks these loans were intended to guarantee eight to weeks of payroll and other costs to provide support to participating businesses and increase the ability of these businesses to retain workers in addition these loans are fully guaranteed by the sba carry a term of two or five years dependent on the date originated and a annualized interest rate on december the coronavirus response and relief supplemental appropriations act coronavirus relief act was signed into law it contains significant additional relief programs including the authorization of a second round of ppp as of march under the ppp we had submitted applications and received funding of approximately billion of which approximately billion had received forgiveness as of that date we believe that we were effective in each round of the ppp in assisting the small businesses in our markets that continue to be impacted by the pandemic inclusive of fees from the sba our yield on ppp loans during the first quarter of was as a result of the pandemic we also implemented a shortterm loan modification program to provide temporary payment relief to certain of our borrowers this program allowed for a deferral of principal andor interest payments for days which may have been extended for an additional days for a maximum of days on a cumulative and successive basis for borrowers requiring a longerterm modification following the shortterm loan modification program we worked with eligible borrowers to modify such loans under section of the cares act the outstanding balance at march of loans which have received these section modifications was approximately million compared to approximately million at december we believe our response to the pandemic has allowed and continues to allow us to appropriately support our associates and clients and their communities the covid19 pandemic along with the implementation of cecl contributed to an increased provision for credit losses in and an extended duration of economic disruption resulting from the virus could lead to increased net chargeoffs and continued elevated levels of provisioning expense we continue to monitor the impact of covid19 the administration efficacy and public acceptance of covid19 vaccines the effects of the cares act coronavirus relief act american relief act and the prospects for additional fiscal stimulus programs closely covid19 continues to spread throughout the united states and cases hospitalizations and deaths in some of our markets remain elevated and recently new variants or mutations of the virus have begun to emerge that in some cases appear to be more contagious than the original virus accordingly the covid19 pandemic continues to impact our operations and the operations of certain of our customers though in the first quarter of the impact appears to be lessening as the average number of cases hospitalizations and deaths in most of our markets have started to decline and the number of residents in our markets that have been vaccinated against the virus continues to rise however our ability and the ability of our customers to recover from the pandemic remains uncertain and will depend on continued reductions in the number and severity of covid19 cases in our markets and improvement in economic conditions in our markets including as a result of continued government support of those individuals and businesses most adversely impacted by the virus overview our diluted net income per common share for the three months ended march was compared to for the same period in at march reflecting the significant number of loans we had originated under the ppp loans had increased to billion as compared to billion at december and total deposits increased to billion at march from billion at december results of operations our net interest income increased to million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in the prior year representing an increase of million for the three months ended march when compared to the comparable period in this increase was largely the result of lower cost of funds the impact of both interest and fees related to ppp loans and our pay down of a portion of the additional liquidity we acquired in in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable periods the net interest margin the ratio of net interest income to average earning assets for the three months ended march was compared to for the same period in and reflects the impact of loans made pursuant to the ppp and our acquisition and subsequent pay down of additional onbalance sheet liquidity as noted above the decline in shortterm interest rates declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets our provision for credit losses was million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in the higher level of provision expense during the three months ended march was largely the result of the anticipated economic impact of the covid19 pandemic the decrease in the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of is primarily due to anticipated improvements in economic conditions also contributing to the provision expense in the first quarter of and was an increase in net chargeoffs which totaled million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in at march our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans inclusive of ppp loans was compared to at december the decrease in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of improvements in the macroeconomic forecasts utilized by our cecl models to estimate future credit losses noninterest income increased by million or during the three months ended march compared to the same period in the growth in noninterest income was in large part attributable to an increase in income from our equity method investment in bhg of million or during the three months ended march compared to the same period in the prior year as well as gains on mortgage loans sold net which increased by million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in the prior year primarily due to the favorable interest rate environment and housing markets in our markets as well as our increased number of mortgage originators in the respective periods these increases were offset in part by a decline in wealth management revenues of million for the three months ended march compared to million in the same period in the prior year as well as the recording of net gains on sales of securities during the three months ended march of with no gains being recorded during the same period in other noninterest income which is the result of fee revenue lines of business other than those noted above increased during the three months ended march by million when compared to the same period in the prior year largely as a result of gains on other equity investments noninterest expense increased by million or during the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march impacting noninterest expense for the three months ended march as compared to the same prior year period was a million increase in salaries and employee benefits the change in salaries and employee benefits was the result of an increase in our associate base in the first quarter of versus the first quarter of annual merit increases as well as the accrual of both our cash and equity incentive plans at abovetarget payout during the three months ended march versus an accrual at belowtarget payout under such plans during the same period in also impacting noninterest expense in the first quarter of were lending related costs related to an increase in our offbalance sheet reserves the higher level of expense related to offbalance sheet reserves is due to the effect that macroeconomic factors impacted by the covid19 pandemic had on our cecl models during the three months ended march subsequent to the implementation of cecl effective january no such additional expense was booked in the first quarter of our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was for the three months ended march compared to for the same period in the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue during the three months ended march we recorded income tax expense of million compared to an income tax benefit of million for the three months ended march our effective tax rate for the three months ended march was compared to a benefit of for the three months ended march our tax expense in the first three months of was impacted by the increased provision for credit losses we recorded during that quarter as discussed above a portion of which was recorded as a discrete item of total income tax in the first quarter of and contributed a tax benefit of million our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equitybased awards previously granted under our equitybased compensation program resulting in the recognition of tax benefits of million for the three months ended march compared to tax benefits of for the three months ended march financial condition net loans increased million or during the three months ended march when compared to december contributing to increased loan volumes during the three months ended march were approximately million of loans issued through the sbas ppp net of forgiveness the remainder of the increase is primarily the result of loans made to borrowers that principally operate or are located in our core markets increases in the number of relationship advisors we employ and continued focus on attracting new customers to our company total deposits were billion at march compared to billion at december an increase of million or deposit growth during the period was likely aided by our clients continued desire to build liquidity to support their businesses through the covid19 pandemic proceeds from the ppp and other government stimulus programs and current stock market conditions but was also due in part to our intentional emphasis on gathering lowcost core deposits during both periods capital and liquidity at march and december our capital ratios including our banks capital ratios exceeded regulatory minimum capital requirements and those necessary to be considered wellcapitalized under applicable federal regulations see note regulatory matters in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q for additional information regarding our capital ratios from time to time we may be required to support the capital needs of our bank pinnacle bank at march we had approximately million of cash at the parent company that could be used to support our bank during the second quarter of we issued million depositary shares each representing a 140th interest in a share of our fixed rate noncumulative perpetual preferred stock series b series b preferred stock in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering expenses payable by us were approximately million the net proceeds were retained at pinnacle financial and the remaining portion thereof is available to support our capital needs and other obligations including payments related to our outstanding indebtedness to support the capital needs and other obligations of our bank and for other general corporate purposes additionally we believe we have various capital raising techniques available to us to provide for the capital needs of our company and bank such as a subordinated debt offering or entering into a new revolving credit facility with another financial institution we also periodically evaluate capital markets conditions to identify opportunities to access those markets if necessary or prudent to support our capital levels during the quarter ended march we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million under our previously authorized share repurchase agreement our last purchase of shares of our common stock under the prior share repurchase program occurred on march as we suspended the program due to uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and it remained suspended until its expiration on december on january our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock the authorization for this program will remain in effect through march we did not repurchase any shares under our current share repurchase program during the three months ended march critical accounting estimates the accounting principles we follow and our methods of applying these principles conform with us gaap and with general practices within the banking industry on january we adopted fasb asu financial instruments credit losses topic which significantly changes our methodology for determining our allowance for credit losses and asu intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment which simplifies our process for performing goodwill impairment testing there have been no other significant changes to our critical accounting estimates as described in our form 10k selected financial information the following is a summary of certain financial information for the three month

interest income represents the amount by which interest earned on various earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits and other interestbearing liabilities and is the most significant component of our revenues net interest income totaled million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in the prior year representing an increase of million for the three months ended march when compared to the comparable period in this increase was largely the result of lower cost of funds the impact of both interest and fees related to the ppp and our pay down of a portion of the additional liquidity we acquired in in response to the economic uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic as well as organic loan growth during the comparable periods offset in part by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio the following tables set forth the amount of our average balances interest income or interest expense for each category of interestearning assets and

a net interest spread of for the three months ended march net interest margin is the result of annualized net interest income calculated on a taxequivalent basis divided by average interestearning assets for the period for the three months ended march our net interest margin was compared to for the same period in our net interest margin for the three months ended march reflects the impact of loans made pursuant to the ppp and our acquisition and subsequent pay down of additional onbalance sheet liquidity as noted above the continued historically low levels for shortterm interest rates declining levels of positive impact from purchase accounting and the competitive rate environments for loans and deposits in our markets more specifically our net interest margin was negatively impacted by yield compression in our earning asset portfolio due to a declining macroeconomic interest rate environment which included a basis points reduction in the federal funds rate in march during the three months ended march our earning asset yield decreased by basis points from the same period in the prior year our total funding rates decreased by basis points compared to the same period in the prior year we continue to deploy various asset liability management strategies to manage our risk to interest rate fluctuations pricing for creditworthy borrowers and meaningful depositors is very competitive in our markets and this competition has adversely impacted and may continue to adversely impact our margins we believe this challenging competitive environment will continue throughout even during a time of economic uncertainty due to covid19 our strategy of adding additional onbalance sheet liquidity to aid in managing through the early uncertainties of covid19 as well as the meaningful increase in core deposit inflows we experienced in and the first quarter of has and will continue to negatively impact the net interest margin until onbalance sheet liquidity returns to more normalized levels provision for credit losses the provision for credit losses represents a charge to earnings necessary to establish an allowance for credit losses that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected credit losses the provision for credit losses amounted to million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march provision expense is impacted by growth in our loan portfolio recent historical and projected future economic conditions our internal assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio and net chargeoffs the higher provision expense during the first quarter of as compared to the first quarter of was the result of the anticipated economic impact of the covid19 pandemic in contrast to the deterioration in the economic outlook that occurred during the first quarter of projected economic conditions improved during the first quarter of resulting in the decrease in provision expense also contributing to provision expense in both periods are net chargeoffs which totaled million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in noninterest income our noninterest income is composed of several components some of which vary significantly between quarterly and annual periods service charges on deposit accounts and other noninterest income generally reflect customer growth trends while fees from our wealth management departments gains on mortgage loans sold gains and losses on the sale of securities and gains or losses related to our efforts to mitigate risks associated with interest rate volatility will often reflect financial market conditions and fluctuate from period to period the following is a summary of our noninterest income for the three months ended march and in thousands three months ended march increase decrease noninterest income service charges on deposit accounts investment services insurance sales commissions gains on mortgage loans sold net investment gains on sales of securities net trust fees income from equity method investment other noninterest income interchange and other consumer fees bankowned life insurance loan swap fees sba loan sales gains losses on other equity investments other noninterest income total other noninterest income total noninterest income the decrease in service charges on deposit accounts in the three months ended march compared to the three months ended march relates to a decline in analysis fees including fee waivers due to the low transaction volumes in commercial checking accounts which we believe is related to the ongoing impact of the covid19 pandemic income from our wealth management groups investments insurance and trust is also included in noninterest income for the three months ended march commissions and fees from investment services at our financial advisory unit pinnacle asset management a division of pinnacle bank and fees from our wealth advisory group pnfp capital markets inc decreased by million to million when compared to the three months ended march at march and pinnacle asset management was receiving commissions and fees in connection with approximately billion and billion respectively in brokerage assets these fees increased million during the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march and were offset by a decline in investment advisory fees from pnfp capital markets inc which decreased million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march revenues from the sale of insurance products by our insurance subsidiaries for the three months ended march decreased by compared to the same period in the prior year included in insurance revenues for the three months ended march was of contingent income received in the first quarter of that was based on sales production and claims experience compared to million recorded in the same period in the prior year additionally at march our trust department was receiving fees on approximately billion of managed assets compared to billion at march reflecting organic growth and increased market valuations we believe the change in our wealth management businesses during the three months ended march when compared to the comparable period in is primarily attributable to market volatility resulting from the uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and its ongoing impact gains on mortgage loans sold net consists of fees from the origination and sale of mortgage loans these mortgage fees are for loans primarily originated in our current markets that are subsequently sold to thirdparty investors substantially all of these loan sales transfer servicing rights to the buyer generally mortgage origination fees increase in lower interest rate environments and more robust housing markets and decrease in rising interest rate environments and more challenging housing markets mortgage origination fees will fluctuate from quarter to quarter as the rate environment changes gains on mortgage loans sold net were million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in the prior year this sizeable increase is the direct result of the current interest rate environment and the strong markets in which we operate we hedge a portion of our mortgage pipeline as part of a mandatory delivery program the hedge is not designated as a hedge for gaap purposes and as such changes in its fair value are recorded directly through the income statement there is a positive correlation between the dollar amount of the mortgage pipeline and the value of this hedge therefore the change in the outstanding mortgage pipeline at the end of any reporting period will directly impact the amount of gain recorded for mortgage loans held for sale during that reporting period at march the mortgage pipeline included million in loans expected to close in compared to million in loans at march expected to close in investment gains and losses on sales net represent the net gains and losses on sales of investment securities in our availableforsale securities portfolio during the periods noted during the three months ended march no securities were sold for gains or losses compared to the three months ended march when we sold approximately million of securities for a net gain of income from equitymethod investment income from equitymethod investment is comprised solely of income from our equitymethod investment in bhg bhg is engaged in the origination of commercial and consumer loans primarily to healthcare providers and other professionals throughout the united states the loans originated by bhg are either financed by secured borrowings or sold without recourse to independent financial institutions and investors bhg has expanded its operations to include commercial lending to other professional service firms such as attorneys accountants and others income from this equitymethod investment was million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period last year historically bhg has sold the majority of the loans its originates to a network of bank purchasers through a combination of online auctions direct sales and its direct purchase option in the second half of bhg began retaining more loans on its balance sheet than historically had been the case in recent years as a result of the economic disruption resulting from the covid19 pandemic bhg throughout and through the first quarter of sold more loans through its auction platform than we had previously anticipated and will likely continue to slow its transition to holding more loans on its balance sheet as the effects of covid19 are monitored in the third quarter of bhg completed its first securitization of approximately million in notes backed by commercial and consumer loans on its balance sheet to provide additional funding income from equitymethod investment is recorded net of amortization expense associated with customer lists and other intangible assets of for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march at march there wer e million of th ese intangible assets that are expected to be amortized in lesser amounts over the next years also included in income from equitymethod investment is accretion income associated with the fair valuation of certain of bhgs liabilities of for the three months ended march compared to for the three months ended march at march there were million of these liabilities that are expected to accrete into income in lesser amounts over the next five years during the three months ended march pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank received million in dividends from bhg in the aggregate during the three months ended march pinnacle financial and pinnacle bank received dividends of million in the aggregate dividends from bhg during such periods reduced the carrying amount of our investment in bhg while earnings from bhg during such periods increased the carrying amount of our investment in bhg profits from intercompany transactions are eliminated our proportionate share of earnings from bhg is included in our consolidated tax return during the three months ended march pinnacle bank purchased million in loans from bhg at par pursuant to bhgs joint venture loan program whereby bhg and pinnacle share proportionately in the credit risk of the acquired loans based on the rate on the loan and the rate of the purchase the yield on this portfolio to pinnacle bank is anticipated to be per annum no loans were purchased from bhg by pinnacle bank for the three months ended march for the three months ended march bhg reported million in revenues net of substitution losses of million compared to revenues of million for the three months ended march net of substitution losses of million earnings from bhg are likely to fluctuate from periodtoperiod approximately million of bhgs revenues for the three months ended march related to gains on the sale of commercial loans compared to million for the three months ended march these loans have typically been sold by bhg with no recourse to a network of community banks and other financial institutions at a premium to the par value of the loan the purchaser may access a bhg cash reserve account of up to of the loan balance to support loan payments bhg retains no servicing or other responsibilities related to the core product loan once sold as a result this gain on sale premium represents bhgs compensation for absorbing the costs to originate the loan as well as marketing expenses associated with maintaining its business model at march and there were billion and billion respectively of these loans previously sold by bhg that were being actively serviced by bhgs network of bank purchasers bhg at its sole option may also provide purchasers of these loans the ability to substitute the acquired loan with another more recentlyissued bhg loan should the previouslyacquired loan become at least 90days past due as to its monthly payments as a result bhg maintained a liability as of march and of million and million respectively that represents an estimate of the future inherent losses for the outstanding core portfolio that may be subject to future substitution due to payment default or loan prepayment this liability represents and respectively of core product loans previously sold by bhg that remain outstanding as of march and respectively the increase in this liability in the three months ended march compared to the period ended march was principally the result of the economic disruption associated with the covid19 pandemic which adversely impacted physician and dental practices in a material manner in addition to these loans that bhg sells into its auction market at march bhg reported loans that remained on bhgs balance sheet totaling billion compared to million as of march a portion of these loans do not qualify for sale accounting and accordingly an offsetting secured borrowing liability has been recorded at march and bhg had million and million respectively of secured borrowings associated with loans held for investment which did not qualify for sale accounting at march and bhg reported allowance for loan losses totaling million and million respectively interest income and fees amounted to million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march included in our other noninterest income are interchange and other consumer fees gains from bankowned life insurance swap fees earned for the facilitation of derivative transactions for our clients sba loan sales gains or losses on other equity investments and other noninterest income items interchange revenues increased during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due to increased debit and credit card transactions periodoverperiod and unused line fees during the first quarter of as compared to the same period in other noninterest income included changes in the cash surrender value of bankowned life insurance which was million for each of the three months ended march and the assets that support these policies are administered by the life insurance carriers and the income we recognize ie increases or decreases in the cash surrender value of the policies on these policies is dependent upon the crediting rates applied by the insurance carriers which are subject to change at the discretion of the carriers subject to any applicable floors earnings on these policies generally are not taxable loan swap fees decreased by million during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due primarily to a change in the volume of activity resulting from the current interest rate environment sba loan sales are also included in other noninterest income and fluctuate based on the current market environment additionally the carrying values of other equity investments are adjusted either upwards or downwards from the transaction price to reflect expected exit values as evidenced by financing and sale transactions with third parties or when determination of a valuation adjustment is confirmed through ongoing reviews by senior investment managers income related to these investments increased million during the three months ended march when compared to the same period in the prior year the other components of other noninterest income increased only slightly during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in and includes all other noninterest income not included in the above noted categories noninterest expense noninterest expense consists of salaries and employee benefits equipment and occupancy expenses other real estate expenses and other operating expenses the following is a summary of our noninterest expense for the three months ended march and in thousands three months ended march increase decrease noninterest expense salaries and employee benefits salaries commissions cash and equity incentives employee benefits and other total salaries and employee benefits equipment and occupancy other real estate expense net marketing and other business development postage and supplies amortization of intangibles other noninterest expense deposit related expense lending related expense wealth management related expense other noninterest expense total other noninterest expense total noninterest expense total salaries and employee benefits expenses increased million for the three months ended march compared to the same period in the change in salaries and employee benefits was the result of an increase in our associate base in versus annual merit raises as well as the accrual of our cash incentive plan at abovetarget payout during the three months ended march compared to an accrual at belowtarget payout due to the effects of covid19 on our anticipated earnings and performance during the three months ended march at march our associate base was fulltime equivalent associates as compared to at march we expect salary and benefit expenses will rise in compared to as we continue our focus on hiring experienced bankers in all of our markets particularly if we continue to accrue cash and equity incentives at abovetarget payout based on anticipated earnings and performance in we believe that cash and equity incentives are a valuable tool in motivating an associate base that is focused on providing our clients effective financial advice and increasing shareholder value as a result and unlike many other financial institutions all of our banks noncommissioned associates participate in our annual cash incentive plan with a minimum targeted bonus equal to of each associates annual salary and all of our banks associates participate in our equity compensation plans under the annual cash incentive plan the targeted level of incentive payments requires achievement of a certain soundness threshold and a targeted level of quarterly pretax preprovision net revenue ppnr and annual earnings per share subject to certain adjustments to the extent that the soundness threshold is met and ppnr and earnings per share are above or below the targeted amount the aggregate incentive payments are increased or decreased historically we have paid between and of our targeted incentives for maximum payouts under the plan could reach of target through the first quarter of we have accrued incentive costs for the cash incentive plan in at greater than of our targeted awards also included in employee benefits and other expense for the three months ended march were approximately million of compensation expenses related to equitybased awards for restricted shares restricted stock unit and performance stock unit awards compared to million for the three months ended march under our equity incentive plans we provide a broadbased equity incentive program for all of our banks associates we believe that equity incentives provide a vehicle for all associates to become meaningful shareholders of pinnacle financial over an extended period of time and create a shareholdercentric culture throughout our organization our compensation expense associated with equity awards for the three months ended march changed only modestly when compared to the three months ended march our compensation expense associated with equity awards with timebased vesting criteria is likely to continue to increase during the remainder of when compared to as a result of the increased number of associates and our intention to hire additional experienced financial advisors compensation expense associated with our performancebased vesting awards will continue to be impacted by our performance in and will likely be higher than the comparable prior year period during the remainder of as beginning in the second quarter of and for the remainder of the year we accrued for those awards at belowtarget levels employee benefits and other expenses were million for the three months ended march compared to million for the three months ended march and include costs associated with our plan health insurance and payroll taxes these costs fluctuate based on changes in our associate base and the level of participation in these programs by our associates costs associated with our health insurance and plan programs increased million in the aggregate during the three months ended march when compared to the same period in equipment and occupancy expenses for the three months ended march were million compared to million for the three months ended march these costs were generally consistent between periods though we expect to incur additional costs in future periods as we continue to enhance both our current locations and our technology infrastructure during the first quarter of a single new office location was opened in the north carolina market other real estate income and expenses net for the three months ended march were benefits of as compared to expenses of million for the same period in the prior year included in the quarter ended march were writedowns of previously foreclosed upon properties to market value based on updated appraisals obtained during that same time period marketing and business development expense for the three months ended march was million compared to million for the three months ended march the primary source of the decrease for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in continues to be the result of limited inperson client meetings and business development expenses as a result of the restrictions resulting from the covid19 pandemic intangible amortization expense was million for the three months ended march compared to million for the same period in the following table outlines our amortizing intangible assets

avenue bnc book of business intangible miller loughry beach insurance capitalmark bnc insurance bnc trust advocate capital these assets are being amortized on an accelerated basis which reflects the anticipated life of the underlying assets amortization expense of these intangibles is estimated to decrease from million to million per year over the next five years with lesser amounts for the remaining amortization period other noninterest expenses which consists primarily of deposit lending wealth management and administrative expenses decreased by million for the three months ended march when compared to the three months ended march deposit related expense increased by million during the three months ended march when compared to the same period in largely the result of increased fdic assessment costs primarily due to the firms increased asset base lendingrelated expenses decreased million during the three months ended march when compared to the same period in this decrease is primarily the result of the effect that macroeconomic factors impacted by the covid19 pandemic had on our cecl models during the three months ended march following the implementation of cecl effective january as a result of improving economic conditions we did not build additional reserves during the three months ended march wealth management related expenses and other noninterest expenses each remained relatively flat for the three months ended march when compared to the same period in our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income and noninterest income was for the three months ended march compared to for the same period in the efficiency ratio measures the amount of expense that is incurred to generate a dollar of revenue the efficiency ratio for the three months ended march compared to the same period in was impacted in part by increased noninterest expense during the period as a result increased salaries and employee benefits as a result of accrual of our cash and equity incentives at above target levels during the quarter gains on mortgage loans sold and income from our equity method investment in bhg income taxes during the three months ended march we recorded income tax expense of million compared to an income tax benefit of million for the three months ended march our effective tax rate for the three months ended march was compared to a benefit of for the three months ended march our effective tax rate differs from the combined federal and state income tax statutory rate in effect of primarily due to our investments in bankqualified municipal securities tax benefits from our real estate investment trust subsidiary participation in tennessees community investment tax credit citc program tax benefits associated with sharebased compensation bankowned life insurance and our captive insurance subsidiary offset in part by the limitation on deductibility of meals and entertainment expense nondeductible fdic insurance premiums and nondeductible executive compensation our tax expense in the three months ended march was impacted by the provision expense recorded in response to the covid19 pandemic which was recorded in the first quarter of as a discrete item of total income tax and contributed a tax benefit of million our tax rate in each period was also impacted by the vesting and exercise of equitybased awards previously granted under our equitybased compensation program resulting in the recognition of tax benefits of million for the three months ended march compared to tax benefits of for the three months ended march financial condition our consolidated balance sheet at march reflects an increase in total loans outstanding to billion compared to billion at december total deposits increased by million between december and march total assets were billion at march compared to billion at december loans the composition of loans at march and at december and the percentage of each classification to total loans are summarized as follows in thousands march december amount percent amount percent commercial real estate owneroccupied nonowner occupied consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total loans at march our loan portfolio composition had changed modestly from the composition at december principally as a result of the ppp loans which are classified as commercial and industrial loans though commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending generally continue to make up the largest segments of our portfolio at march approximately of the outstanding principal balance of our commercial real estate loans was secured by owneroccupied commercial real estate properties compared to at december owneroccupied commercial real estate is similar in many ways to our commercial and industrial lending in that these loans are generally made to businesses on the basis of the cash flows of the business rather than on the valuation of the real estate additionally the construction and land development loan segment continues to be a meaningful portion of our portfolio and reflects the development and growth of the local communities in which we operate and is diversified between commercial residential and land banking regulations have established guidelines for the construction ratio of less than of total riskbased capital and for the nonowner occupied ratio of less than of total riskbased capital should a banks ratios be in excess of these guidelines banking regulations generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by pinnacle banks total riskbased capital at march pinnacle banks construction and land development loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital was compared to at december construction and land development nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and as of march and december respectively at march pinnacle bank was within the and guidelines and has established what it believes to be appropriate controls to monitor its lending in these areas as it aims to keep the level of these loans to below the and thresholds the following table classifies our fixed and variable rate loans at march according to contractual maturities of one year or less after one year through five years and after five years the table also classifies our variable rate loans

are not included in nonperforming assets amounted to approximately million or of total loans at march compared to million or of total loans at december potential problem loans represent those loans with a welldefined weakness and where information about possible credit problems of borrowers has caused management to have doubts about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms this definition is believed to be substantially consistent with the standards established by pinnacle banks primary regulators for loans classified as substandard excluding the impact of substandard nonaccrual loans and substandard troubled debt restructurings troubled debt restructurings are not included in potential problem loans approximately million of potential problem loans were past due at least days but less than days as of march nonperforming assets and troubled debt restructurings at march we had million in nonperforming assets compared to million at december included in nonperforming assets were million in nonaccrual loans and million in oreo and other nonperforming assets at march and million in nonaccrual loans and million in oreo and other nonperforming assets at december at both march and december there were million of troubled debt restructurings all of which were accruing as of the restructured date and remain on accrual status in response to the covid19 pandemic and its economic impact to its customers pinnacle bank implemented a shortterm modification program in accordance with interagency regulatory guidance to provide temporary payment relief to those borrowers directly impacted by covid19 who were not more than days past due at the time of modification this program allows for a deferral of payments of principal andor interest for days which pinnacle bank may extend for an additional days for a maximum of days on a cumulative and successive basis pursuant to the interagency regulatory guidance pinnacle financial may elect to not classify loans for which these deferrals were granted as tdrs in addition to the shortterm modification program implemented by pinnacle bank as discussed above section of the cares act and bank regulatory interagency guidance gave entities temporary relief from the accounting and disclosure requirements for tdrs indicating that a lender could conclude that the modifications are not a troubled debt restructuring if the borrower was less than days past due as of december we have followed the guidance under the cares act and the interagency guidance related to these loan modifications at march we had approximately million in loans modified under section of the cares act compared to approximately million at december allowance for credit losses on loans allowance on january we adopted fasb asu which introduced the current expected credit losses cecl methodology and required us to estimate all expected credit losses over the remaining life of our loan portfolio accordingly the allowance for credit losses represents an amount that in managements evaluation is adequate to provide coverage for all expected future credit losses on outstanding loans as of march and december our allowance for credit losses was approximately million and million respectively which our management believes to be adequate at each of the respective dates our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans inclusive of ppp loans was at march down from at december no allowance for credit losses has been recorded for ppp loans as they are fully guaranteed by the sba the decrease in the allowance for credit losses is largely the result of the improvements in the macroeconomic forecast our cecl models rely largely on recent historical and projected future macroeconomic conditions to estimate future credit losses macroeconomic factors used in the model include the national unemployment rate gross domestic product the commercial real estate price index and certain us treasury interest rates projections of these macroeconomic factors obtained from an independent third party are utilized to predict quarterly rates of default these macroeconomic factors experienced significant deterioration during the first six months of resulting in a significant increase in our allowance for credit losses during the same period though these factors improved during the second half of and through the first quarter of should they deteriorate in future periods our modeling may require increased levels of provision expense over those recorded during the three months ended march under the cecl methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective basis for pools of loans with similar risk characteristics and for loans that do not share similar risk characteristics with the collectively evaluated pools evaluations are performed on an individual basis losses are predicted over a period of time determined to be reasonable and supportable and at the end of the reasonable and supportable period losses are reverted to long term historical averages at march reasonable and supportable periods of months were utilized for all loan segments followed by a month straight line reversion period to long term averages the following table sets forth based on managements estimate the allocation of the allowance for credit losses to categories of loans as of march and december and the percentage of loans in each category to total loans in thousands march december amount percent amount percent commercial real estate owner occupied nonowner occupied consumer real estate mortgage construction and land development commercial and industrial consumer and other total allowance for credit losses on loans the following is a summary of changes in the allowance for credit

outstanding for the period net chargeoffs for the yeartodate period ended march have been annualized pinnacle financials management assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis this assessment includes procedures to estimate the allowance and test the adequacy and appropriateness of the resulting balance the level of the allowance is based upon managements evaluation of historical default and loss experience current and projected economic conditions asset quality trends known and inherent risks in the portfolio adverse situations that may affect the borrowers ability to repay the loan including the timing of future payments the estimated value of any underlying collateral composition of the loan portfolio industry and peer bank loan quality indications and other pertinent factors including regulatory recommendations the allowance is increased by provisions charged to expense and decreased by chargeoffs net of recoveries of amounts previously chargedoff based upon our evaluation of the loan portfolio we believe the allowance for credit losses to be adequate to absorb our estimate of expected future credit losses on loans outstanding at march while our policies and procedures used to estimate the allowance for credit losses as well as the resultant provision for credit losses charged to operations are considered adequate by management they are necessarily approximate and imprecise there are factors beyond our control such as conditions in the local and national economy local real estate market or a particular industry or borrower which may negatively impact materially our asset quality and the adequacy of our allowance for credit losses and thus the resulting provision for credit losses in particular the length and severity of the economic disruption of the covid19 pandemic and the speed with which the economy will recover is difficult to predict and each may be worse than we have estimated which could cause our provision for credit losses to be negatively impacted for the duration of the pandemic and its aftermath we believe borrowers that operate in the restaurant entertainment hospitality and retail sectors including owners of commercial real estate properties and hotels continue to be the most likely to be negatively impacted by the economic disruptions related to the covid19 pandemic though other borrowers have been and are likely to continue to be negatively impacted as well if the strict social distancing practices or saferathome directives that were initially implemented in response to the spread of covid19 were to return these impacts could be more severe than currently anticipated investments our investment portfolio consisting primarily of federal agency bonds mortgagebacked securities and state and municipal securities amounted to billion and billion at march and december respectively our investment portfolio serves many purposes including serving as a stable source of income as collateral for public funds deposits and as a potential liquidity source a summary of our investment portfolio at march and december follows march december weighted average life years years effective duration tax equivalent yield the metric is presented net of fair value hedges tied to certain investment portfolio holdings the effective duration of the investment portfolio without the fair value hedges as of march and december was and respectively restricted cash our restricted cash balances totaled approximately million at march compared to million at december this restricted cash is maintained at other financial institutions as collateral primarily for our derivative portfolio the decrease in restricted cash is attributable primarily to a decrease in collateral requirements on certain derivative instruments for which the fair value has increased see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q securities purchased with agreement to resell during the three months ended march we entered into a million repurchase agreement transaction with a financial institution counterparty this investment deploys some of our liquidity position into an instrument that improves the return on those funds in the current low rate environment additionally we believe it positions us more favorably for a potential rising interest rate environment in the future deposits and other borrowings we had approximately billion of deposits at march compared to billion at december our deposits consist of noninterest and interestbearing demand accounts savings accounts money market accounts and time deposits additionally we routinely enter into agreements with certain customers to sell certain securities under agreements to repurchase the security the following day these agreements which are typically associated with comprehensive treasury management programs for our clients and provide them with shortterm returns for their excess funds amounted to million at march and million at december additionally at march and december pinnacle bank had borrowed million and billion respectively in advances from the federal home loan bank of cincinnati fhlb at march pinnacle bank had approximately billion in additional availability with the fhlb however incremental borrowings are subject to applicable collateral requirements and are made in a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb generally we have classified our funding base as either core funding or noncore funding as shown in the table below the following table represents the balances of our deposits and other funding and the percentage of each type to the total at march and december march percent december percent core funding noninterestbearing deposit accounts interestbearing demand accounts savings and money market accounts time deposit accounts less than reciprocating demand deposit accounts reciprocating

total wholesale funding total noncore funding totals the reciprocating categories consists of deposits we receive from a bank network the promontory network in connection with deposits of our customers in excess of our fdic coverage limit that we place with the promontory network as noted in the table above our core funding as a percentage of total funding increased from at december to at march primarily as a result of the significant increase in deposits estimated to have been funded in part by ppp loans and other government stimulus payments and decreases in wholesale funding that was intentionally utilized to build onbalance sheet liquidity as we prepared for the initial impact of the covid19 pandemic competition for core deposits in our markets remains very competitive and we anticipate that our percentage of noncore funding is likely to increase as ppp loan funds and stimulus monies are utilized when wholesale funding is necessary to complement the companys core deposit base management determines which source is best suited to address both liquidity risk management and interest rate risk management objectives our asset liability management policy imposes limitations on overall wholesale funding reliance and on brokered deposit exposure specifically both our overall reliance on wholesale funding and exposure to brokered deposits and brokered time deposits were within those policy limitations as of march our funding policies impose limits on the amount of noncore funding we can utilize based on the noncore funding dependency ratio which is calculated pursuant to regulatory guidelines periodically we may exceed our policy limitations at which time management will develop plans to bring our funding sources back into compliance with our core funding ratios at march and december we were in compliance with our core funding policies though growing our core deposit base is a key strategic objective of our firm and we experienced meaningful growth in core deposits in the first three months of we may increase our noncore funding amounts from current levels if we need to do so to fund growth or increase levels of onbalance sheet liquidity but we do not currently anticipate that such increases will exceed the limits we have established in our internal policies for total levels of noncore funding the amount of time deposits as of march amounted to billion the following table shows our time deposits in denominations of less than and in denominations of and greater by category based on time remaining until maturity and the weighted average rate for each category as of march in thousands balances weighted avg rate denominations less than three months or less over three but less than six months over six but less than twelve months over twelve

established or through acquisition acquired twelve statutory business trusts which were established to issue 30year trust preferred securities and certain other subordinated debt agreements these securities qualify as tier capital subject to annual phase outs beginning five years from maturity on april we established a credit facility with the federal reserve bank in conjunction with the ppp

preferred stock with a liquidation preference of per share of series b preferred stock in a registered public offering to both retail and institutional investors net proceeds from the transaction after underwriting discounts and offering costs were approximately million the net proceeds were initially retained by pinnacle financial and the remaining net proceeds are available to support our

general corporate purposes for additional information regarding our capital and shareholders equity see note regulatory matters in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q share repurchase program during the quarter ended march we repurchased approximately million shares of our common stock at an aggregate cost of million under our previously authorized share repurchase agreement our last purchase of shares of our common stock under the prior share repurchase program occurred on march as we suspended the program due to uncertainty surrounding the covid19 pandemic and it remained suspended until its expiration on december on january our board of directors authorized a new share repurchase program for up to million of our outstanding common stock the authorization for this program will remain in effect through march we purchased no shares under our current program in the first three months of dividends pursuant to tennessee banking law our bank may not without the prior consent of the tdfi pay any dividends to us in a calendar year in excess of the total of our banks retained net profits for that year plus the retained net profits for the preceding two years which was million at march our bank did not pay dividends to us during the three months ended march during the three months ended march we paid million in dividends to our common shareholders and million in dividends on our series b preferred stock on april our board of directors declared a per share quarterly cash dividend to common shareholders which should approximate million in aggregate dividend payments that are expected to be paid on may to common shareholders of record as of the close of business on may additionally on that same day our board of directors approved a quarterly dividend of approximately million or per share or per depositary share on the series b preferred stock payable on june to shareholders of record at the close of business on may the amount and timing of all future dividend payments if any is subject to board discretion and will depend on our earnings capital position financial condition and other factors including if necessary our receipt of dividends from pinnacle bank regulatory capital requirements as they become known to us and receipt of any regulatory approvals that may become required as a result of our and our bank subsidiarys financial results market and liquidity risk management our objective is to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring these policies which are designed to ensure acceptable composition of assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management interest rate sensitivity in the normal course of business we are exposed to market risk arising from fluctuations in interest rates alco measures and evaluates the interest rate risk so that we can meet customer demands for various types of loans and deposits alco determines the most appropriate amounts of onbalance sheet and offbalance sheet items measurements which we use to help us manage interest rate sensitivity include an earnings simulation model and an economic value of equity eve model our interest rate sensitivity modeling incorporates a number of assumptions for both earnings simulation and eve including loan and deposit repricing characteristics the rate of loan prepayments etc alco periodically reviews these assumptions for accuracy based on historical data and future expectations our alco policy requires that the base scenario assumes rates remain flat and is the scenario to which all others are compared in order to measure the change in net interest income and eve policy limits are applied to the results of certain modeling scenarios while the primary policy scenarios focus is on a twelve month time frame for the earnings simulations model longer time horizons are also modeled all policy scenarios assume a static volume forecast where the balance sheet is held constant although other scenarios are modeled earnings simulation model we believe interest rate risk is best measured by our earnings simulation modeling earning assets interestbearing liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments are combined with forecasts of interest rates for the next months and are combined with other factors in order to produce various earnings simulations over that same 12month period to limit interest rate risk we have policy guidelines for our earnings at risk which seek to limit the variance of net interest income in both gradual and instantaneous changes to interest rates for instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates from managements flat interest rate forecast over the next twelve months assuming a static balance sheet the following estimated changes are calculated estimated change in net interest income over months march instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps decrease negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact further the earnings simulation model does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate any potential adverse impact of changes in interest rates the behavior of our deposit portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios set out in the table above is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the projected impact on net interest income in the table above assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternative rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higheryielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce the assumed benefit of those deposits the projected impact on net interest income in the table above also assumes a throughthecycle nonmaturity deposit beta which may not be an accurate predictor of actual deposit rate changes realized in scenarios of smaller andor nonparallel interest rate movements at march our earnings simulation model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy economic value of equity model while earnings simulation modeling attempts to determine the impact of a changing rate environment to our net interest income our eve model measures estimated changes to the economic values of our assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items as a result of interest rate changes economic values are determined by discounting expected cash flows from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet items which establishes a base case eve we then shock rates as prescribed by our asset liability policy and measure the sensitivity in eve values for each of those shocked rate scenarios versus the base case the asset liability policy sets limits for those sensitivities at march our eve modeling calculated the following estimated changes in eve due to instantaneous upward and downward changes in rates march instantaneous rate change bps increase bps increase bps decrease negative interest rates are not contemplated in these scenarios the treasury curve and all shortterm rate indices such as fed funds libor etc are assumed to be zero bound while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this analysis to provide an estimate of exposure under these scenarios we believe that a gradual shift in interest rates would have a more modest impact since eve measures the discounted present value of cash flows over the estimated lives of instruments the change in eve does not directly correlate to the degree that earnings would be impacted over a shorter time horizon ie the current year further eve does not take into account factors such as future balance sheet growth changes in product mix changes in yield curve relationships hedging activities we might take and changing product spreads that could mitigate the adverse impact of changes in interest rates at march our eve model indicated we were in compliance with our policies for all interest rate scenarios for which we model as required by our board approved asset liability policy most likely earnings simulation models we also analyze a mostlikely earnings simulation scenario that projects the expected change in rates based on a forward yield curve adopted by management using expected balance sheet volumes forecasted by management separate growth assumptions are developed for loans investments deposits etc other interest rate scenarios analyzed by management may include delayed rate shocks yield curve steepening or flattening or other variations in rate movements to further analyze or stress our balance sheet under various interest rate scenarios each scenario is evaluated by management these processes assist management to better anticipate our financial results and as a result management may determine the need to invest in other operating strategies and tactics which might enhance results or better position the firms balance sheet to reduce interest rate risk going forward each of the above analyses may not on its own be an accurate indicator of how our net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates income associated with interestearning assets and costs associated with interestbearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates in addition the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income for example although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates in addition certain assets such as adjustable rate mortgage loans have features generally referred to as interest rate caps and floors which limit changes in interest rates prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the maturity of certain instruments the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease during periods of rising interest rates alco reviews each of the above interest rate sensitivity analyses along with several different interest rate scenarios as part of its responsibility to provide a satisfactory consistent level of profitability within the framework of established liquidity loan investment borrowing and capital policies managements model governance model implementation and model validation processes and controls are subject to review in our regulatory examinations to ensure they are in compliance with the most recent regulatory guidelines and industry and regulatory practices management utilizes a respected sophisticated third party asset liability modeling software to help ensure implementation of managements assumptions into the model are processed as intended in a robust manner that said there are numerous assumptions regarding financial instrument behavior that are integrated into the model the assumptions are formulated by combining observations gleaned from our historical studies of financial instruments and our best estimations of how if at all these instruments may behave in the future given changes in economic conditions technology etc these assumptions may prove to be inaccurate additionally given the large number of assumptions built into our asset liability modeling software it is difficult at best to compare our results to other firms alco may determine that pinnacle financial should over time become more or less asset or liability sensitive depending on the underlying balance sheet circumstances and our conclusions as to anticipated interest rate fluctuations in future periods at present alco has determined that its most likely rate scenario considers no change in shortterm interest rates throughout the remainder of our most likely rate forecast is based primarily on information we acquire from a service which includes a consensus forecast of numerous interest rate benchmarks we may implement additional actions designed to achieve our desired sensitivity position which could change from time to time we have in the past used and may in the future continue to use derivative financial instruments as one tool to manage our interest rate sensitivity including in our mortgage lending program while continuing to meet the credit and deposit needs of our customers for further details on the derivatives we currently use see note derivative instruments in the notes to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form 10q we may also enter into interest rate swaps to facilitate customer transactions and meet their financing needs these swaps qualify as derivatives even though they are not designated as hedging instruments liquidity risk management the purpose of liquidity risk management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows to satisfy loan demand deposit withdrawals and our other needs traditional sources of liquidity for a bank include asset maturities and growth in core deposits a bank may achieve its desired liquidity objectives from the management of its assets and liabilities and by internally generated funding through its operations funds invested in marketable instruments that can be readily sold and the continuous maturing of other earning assets are sources of liquidity from an asset perspective the liability base provides sources of liquidity through attraction of increased deposits and borrowing funds from various other institutions to assist in determining the adequacy of our liquidity we perform a variety of liquidity stress tests including idiosyncratic systemic and combined scenarios for both moderate and severe events liquidity is defined as the ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without significant loss and to raise additional funds by increasing liabilities liquidity management involves maintaining our ability to meet the daily cash flow requirements of our customers both depositors and borrowers we seek to maintain a sufficiently liquid asset balance to ensure our ability to meet our obligations the amount of the appropriate minimum liquid asset balance is determined through severe liquidity stress testing as measured by our liquidity coverage ratio calculation at march we were in compliance with our internal policies related to liquidity coverage ratio changes in interest rates also affect our liquidity position we currently price deposits in response to market rates if deposits are not priced in response to market rates a loss of deposits particularly noncore deposit could occur which would negatively affect our liquidity position scheduled loan payments are a relatively stable source of funds but loan payoffs and deposit flows fluctuate significantly being influenced by interest rates general economic conditions and competition additionally debt security investments are subject to prepayment and call provisions that could accelerate their payoff prior to stated maturity we attempt to price our deposit products to meet our assetliability objectives consistent with local market conditions our alco is responsible for monitoring our ongoing liquidity needs our regulators also monitor our liquidity and capital resources on a periodic basis in addition our bank is a member of the fhlb cincinnati as a result our bank receives advances from the fhlb cincinnati pursuant to the terms of various borrowing agreements which support our funding needs under the borrowing agreements with the fhlb cincinnati our bank has pledged certain qualifying residential mortgage loans and pursuant to a blanket lien all qualifying commercial mortgage loans as collateral as such pinnacle bank may use the fhlb cincinnati as a source of liquidity depending on its alco strategies additionally we may pledge additional qualifying assets reduce the amount of pledged assets or experience changes in the value of pledged assets with the fhlb cincinnati to increase or decrease our borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati at march we estimate we had billion in additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb cincinnati however incremental borrowings are made via a formal request by pinnacle bank and the subsequent approval by the fhlb cincinnati at march our bank had received advances from the fhlb cincinnati totaling million at march the scheduled maturities of pinnacle banks fhlb cincinnati advances and interest rates are as follows in thousands scheduled maturities amount interest rates thereafter deferred costs total federal home loan bank advances weighted average interest rate some fhlb cincinnati advances include variable interest rates and could increase in the future the table reflects rates in effect as of march pinnacle bank also has accommodations with upstream correspondent banks available for unsecured shortterm advances which aggregate million these accommodations have various covenants related to their term and availability and in most cases must be repaid within a month of borrowing we had no outstanding borrowings at march under these agreements our bank also had approximately billion in available federal reserve discount window lines of credit at march at march excluding reciprocating time and money market deposits issued through the promontory network we had billion of brokered deposits historically we have issued brokered certificates of deposit through several different brokerage houses based on competitive bid during and in response to the uncertainty resulting from the covid19 pandemic we intentionally increased our levels of onbalance sheet liquidity during the first quarter of this increase was funded by a combination of increased core deposits increased borrowings from the fhlb cincinnati and increases in brokered time deposits core deposit growth during the remainder of and through the first quarter of increased such that we were able to prepay certain wholesale maturities while maintaining an elevated level of onbalance sheet liquidity we intend to prepay andor let mature wholesale funding as core deposit growth allows over the next few quarters banking regulators have defined additional liquidity guidelines through the issuance of the basel iii liquidity coverage ratio lcr and the modified lcr these regulatory guidelines became effective january with phase in over subsequent years and require these large institutions to follow prescriptive guidance in determining an absolute level of a high quality liquid asset hqla buffer that must be maintained on their balance sheets in order to withstand a potential liquidity crisis event although pinnacle financial follows the principles outlined in the interagency policy statement on liquidity risk management issued march to determine its hqla buffer pinnacle financial is not currently subject to these regulations however these formulas could eventually be imposed on smaller banks such as pinnacle bank and require an increase in the absolute level of liquidity on our balance sheet which could result in lower net interest margins for us in future periods at march we had no individually significant commitments for capital expenditures but we believe the number of our locations including nonbranch locations will increase over an extended period of time across our footprint and that certain of our locations will be in need of required renovations in future periods these expansions and renovation projects may lead to additional equipment and occupancy expenses as well as related increases in salaries and benefits expense additionally we expect we will continue to incur costs associated with technology improvements to enhance the infrastructure of our firm offbalance sheet arrangements at march we had outstanding standby letters of credit of million and unfunded loan commitments outstanding of billion because these commitments generally have fixed expiration dates and many will expire without being drawn upon the total commitment level does not necessarily represent future cash requirements if needed to fund these outstanding commitments pinnacle bank has the ability to liquidate federal funds sold or on a shortterm basis to borrow and purchase federal funds from other financial institutions impact of inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with us gaap and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of
