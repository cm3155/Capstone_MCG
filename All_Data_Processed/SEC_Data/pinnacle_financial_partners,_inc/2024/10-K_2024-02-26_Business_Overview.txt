different competitors many of whom are larger and have more financial resources than we do such competitors primarily include national regional and internet banks within the various markets in which we operate though we also compete with smaller community banks that seek to offer service levels similar to ours we also face competition from many other types of institutions including without limitation savings and loans associations credit unions finance companies brokerage firms insurance companies and other financial intermediaries the financial services industry is becoming even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes and continued consolidation banks securities firms and insurance companies can operate as affiliates under the umbrella of a financial holding company which can offer virtually any type of financial service including banking securities underwriting insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking also technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems many of our nonbank competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures additionally due to their size many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and as a result may be able to develop and offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services finally our competitors may choose to offer lower interest rates and pay higher deposit rates than we do the actions of these competitors in these regards could cause us to lose customers or elements of the total business relationship we have with a client which could negatively impact our business we believe that the most important criteria to our banks targeted clients when selecting a bank is their desire to receive exceptional and personal service equally important is being able to enjoy convenient access to a broad array of financial products offered by a financial institution with an ability to meet the changing needs of a sophisticated client base additionally when presented with a choice we believe that many of our banks targeted clients would prefer to deal with an institution that favors local decision making as opposed to one where many important decisions regarding a clients financial affairs are made outside of the local community employees and human capital from our founding we have focused on building an excellent work environment because we believe excited associates lead to engaged clients and that engaged clients contribute to enriched shareholders our hiring philosophy has always been to create the best place to

relationships of the nations financial institutions in the us congress passed the doddfrank act which includes significant consumer protection provisions related to among other things residential mortgage loans that have increased and are likely to further increase our regulatory compliance costs the doddfrank act also imposes other restrictions on our operations including restrictions on the types of investments that bank holding companies and banks can make failure to comply with the requirements of the doddfrank act would negatively impact our results of operations and financial condition and could limit our growth or expansion activities while we cannot predict what effect any presently contemplated or future changes in the laws or regulations or their interpretations would have on us such changes could be materially adverse to our investors interchange fees the doddfrank act included provisions known as the durbin amendment which restrict interchange fees to those which are reasonable and proportionate for certain debit card issuers and limits the ability of networks and issuers to restrict debit card transaction routing the federal reserve issued final rules implementing the durbin amendment on june in the final rules interchange fees for debit card transactions were capped at plus five basis points plus for fraud loss in order to be eligible for a safe harbor such that the fee is conclusively determined to be reasonable and proportionate the interchange fee restrictions contained in the durbin amendment and the rules promulgated thereunder only apply to debit card issuers with billion or more in total consolidated assets like pinnacle bank the implications of the durbin amendment first became applicable to us on july the volcker rul e section of the bank holding company act and its implementing regulations commonly referred to as the volcker rule prohibit banking entities from engaging in proprietary trading and prohibits certain interests in or relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds the volcker rule applies to pinnacle financial pinnacle bank and their affiliates in october the federal banking agencies

bureau the doddfrank act also created the cfpb which took over responsibility for enforcing the principal federal consumer protection laws such as the truth in lending act the equal credit opportunity act the service members civil relief act the real estate settlement procedures act and the truth in saving act among others on july we are subject to oversight by the cfpb the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including among other things the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers a lack of financial savvy b inability to protect himself in the selection or use of consumer financial products or services or c reasonable reliance on a covered entity to act in the consumers interests the cfpb has the authority to investigate possible violations of federal consumer financial law hold hearings and commence civil litigation the cfpb can issue ceaseanddesist orders against banks and other entities that violate consumer financial laws the cfpb may also institute a civil action against an entity in violation of federal consumer financial law in order to impose a civil penalty or an injunction the cfpb has been active in bringing enforcement actions related to consumer financial protection laws and obtaining the forms of relief described above and we expect the cfpbs oversight and enforcement to continue to increase over the next few years as was the case in when the cfpb among other initiatives focused on deposit and other service charge fee practices of banks causing many banks including pinnacle bank to lower or in certain cases eliminate certain fees it charges customers who overdraw their accounts or have checks or other items presented when the customers account does not have sufficient funds to cover those checks or other items the rules issued by the cfpb will have a longterm impact on our business including our mortgage loan origination and servicing activities and our service charge practices compliance with these rules has increased and will continue to increase our overall regulatory compliance costs on july the cfpb took over conducting onsite consumer examinations from the fdic for all regulations that transferred under their supervision economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act on may president trump signed into law the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act the growth act the growth act alters some of the provisions of the doddfrank act certain of these provisions to which we became subject once our total assets exceeded billion are set out below along with the changes made to such provisions under the growth act under the doddfrank act publicly traded bank holding companies with billion or more in total assets like pinnacle financial were required to establish a risk committee responsible for oversight of enterprisewide risk management practices pinnacle financial established a risk committee on february the growth act raised the minimum asset threshold triggering the requirement to establish a risk committee from billion to billion as a result pinnacle financial is no longer required to maintain its standalone risk committee though it has done so and expects it will continue to do so pursuant to the doddfrank act any banking organization including whether a bank holding company or a depository institution with more than billion in total consolidated assets and regulated by a federal financial regulatory agency was required to conduct annual companyrun stress tests to ensure it had sufficient capital during periods of economic downturn pinnacle financials and pinnacle banks first stress tests were due in july the growth act raised the asset threshold at which companies are required to conduct the stress tests from billion to billion while we are no longer required to annually conduct stress tests under the doddfrank act we have continued to perform and expect to continue to perform stress tests from time to time in connection with our capital planning process and to monitor our capital consistent with the safety and soundness expectations of the federal regulators while the economic growth act provides some regulatory relief for midsized bank holding companies like us most provisions of the doddfrank act and its implementing regulations remain in place and will continue to result in additional operating and compliance costs that could have a material adverse effect on our business

economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies the federal reserves monetary policies have had and are likely to continue to have an important impact on the operating results of commercial banks through the federal reserves statutory power to implement national monetary policy in order among other things to curb inflation or combat a recession the federal reserve through its monetary and fiscal policies affects the levels of bank loans investments and deposits through its control over the issuance of united states government
