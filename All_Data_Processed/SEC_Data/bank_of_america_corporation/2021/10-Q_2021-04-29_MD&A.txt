management in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k market risk is the risk that changes in market conditions may adversely impact the value of assets or liabilities or otherwise negatively impact earnings this risk is inherent in the financial instruments associated with our operations primarily bank of america within our global markets segment we are also exposed to these risks in other areas of the corporation eg our alm activities in the event of market stress these risks could have a material impact on our results we have been affected and may continue to be affected by market stress resulting from the pandemic that began in the first quarter of for more information see executive summary recent developments covid19 pandemic on page trading risk management to evaluate risks in our trading activities we focus on the actual and potential volatility of revenues generated by individual positions as well as portfolios of positions var is a common statistic used to measure market risk our primary var statistic is equivalent to a percent confidence level which means that for a var with a oneday holding period there should not be losses in excess of var on

predefined statistical distribution table presents average trading var statistics at percent and percent confidence levels for the three months ended march december and march the increase in var for

total marketbased portfolio backtesting the accuracy of the var methodology is evaluated by backtesting which compares the daily var results utilizing a oneday holding period against a comparable subset of trading revenue for more information on our backtesting process see trading risk management backtesting in the mda of the corporations annual report on form 10k during the three months ended march there were no days where this subset of trading revenue had losses that exceeded our total covered portfolio var utilizing a oneday holding period total tradingrelated revenue total tradingrelated revenue excluding brokerage fees and cva dva and funding valuation adjustment gains losses represents the total amount earned from trading positions including marketbased net interest income which are taken in a diverse range of financial instruments and markets for more information see trading risk management total tradingrelated revenue in the mda of the corporations annual

months ended december during the three months ended march positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million this compares to the three months ended december where positive tradingrelated revenue was recorded for percent of the trading days of which percent were daily trading gains of over million and the largest loss was million trading portfolio stress testing because the very nature of a var model suggests results can exceed our estimates and it is dependent on a limited historical window we also stress test our portfolio using scenario analysis this analysis estimates the change in the value of our trading portfolio that may result from abnormal market movements for

12month forward rates december spot rates 12month forward rates table shows the pretax impact to forecasted net interest income over the next months from march and december resulting from instantaneous parallel and nonparallel shocks to the marketbased forward curve periodically we evaluate the scenarios presented so that they are meaningful in the context of the current rate environment the interest rate scenarios also assume us dollar rates are floored at zero during the three months ended march the decrease in asset sensitivity of our balance sheet to uprate and downrate scenarios was primarily due to an increase in longend rates we continue to be asset sensitive to a parallel upward move in interest rates with the majority of that impact coming from the short end of the yield curve additionally higher interest rates impact the fair value of debt securities and accordingly for debt securities classified as afs may adversely affect oci and thus capital levels under the basel capital rules under instantaneous upward parallel shifts the nearterm adverse impact to basel capital is reduced over time by offsetting positive impacts to net interest income

longend instantaneous change the sensitivity analysis in table assumes that we take no action in response to these rate shocks and does not assume any change in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated with changes in interest rates as part of our alm activities we use securities certain residential mortgages and interest rate and foreign exchange derivatives in managing interest rate sensitivity the behavior of our deposits portfolio in the baseline forecast and in alternate interest rate scenarios is a key assumption in our projected estimates of net interest income the sensitivity analysis in table assumes no change in deposit portfolio size or mix from the baseline forecast in alternate rate environments in higher rate scenarios any customer activity resulting in the replacement of lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits with higher yielding deposits or marketbased funding would reduce our benefit in those scenarios interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts we use interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts in our alm activities to manage our interest rate and foreign exchange risks specifically we use those derivatives to manage both the variability in cash flows and changes in fair value of various assets and liabilities arising from those risks our interest rate derivative contracts are generally nonleveraged swaps tied to various benchmark interest rates and foreign exchange basis swaps options futures and forwards and our foreign exchange contracts include crosscurrency interest rate swaps foreign currency futures contracts foreign currency forward contracts and options the derivatives used in our alm activities can be split into two broad categories designated accounting hedges and other risk management derivatives designated accounting hedges are primarily used to manage our exposure to interest rates as described in the interest rate risk management for the banking book section and are included in the sensitivities presented in table the corporation also uses foreign currency derivatives in accounting hedges to manage substantially all of the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations by hedging the foreign exchange risk of our foreign operations the corporations market risk exposure in this area is insignificant risk management derivatives are predominantly used to hedge foreign exchange risks related to various foreign currencydenominated assets and liabilities and eliminate substantially all foreign currency exposures in the cash flows of the corporations nontrading foreign currencydenominated financial instruments these foreign exchange derivatives are sensitive to other market risk exposures such as crosscurrency basis spreads and interest rate risk however as these features are not a significant component of these foreign exchange derivatives the market risk related to this exposure is insignificant for more information on the accounting for derivatives see note derivatives to the consolidated financial statements mortgage banking risk management we originate fund and service mortgage loans which subject us to credit liquidity and interest rate risks among others we determine whether loans will be held for investment or held for sale at the time of commitment and manage credit and liquidity risks by selling or securitizing a portion of the loans we originate changes in interest rates impact the value of interest rate lock commitments irlcs and the related residential first mortgage loans heldforsale lhfs as well as the value of the msrs because the interest rate risks of these hedged items offset we combine them into one overall hedged item with one combined economic hedge portfolio consisting of derivative contracts and securities for more

economy and risks related to the physical impacts of climate change the financial impacts of transition risk can lead to and amplify credit risk physical risk can also lead to increased credit risk by diminishing borrowers repayment capacity or collateral values as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types we have developed and continue to enhance processes to embed climate risk considerations into our risk framework and risk management programs established for strategic credit market liquidity compliance operational and reputational risks for more information on our
