regulations require major us bhcs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and noncapital standards established under the fdicia to the extent that the federal reserve increases our stress capital buffer scb global systemically important bank gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders could decrease as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal reserve those scenarios may affect our ccar stress test results which may impact the level of our scb additionally the federal reserve may impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing common stock dividends or repurchasing common stock for example as a result of the economic uncertainty resulting from the pandemic the federal reserve required that during the second half of all large banks including the corporation suspend share repurchase programs except for repurchases to offset shares awarded under equitybased compensation plans and limit common stock dividends to existing rates that did not exceed the average of the last four quarters net income in the first quarter of the federal reserve lifted the suspension of share repurchase programs and permitted large banks to pay common stock dividends and to repurchase shares in an amount that when combined with dividends paid does not exceed the average of net income over the last four quarters if the federal reserve finds that any of our banks are not wellcapitalized or wellmanaged we would be required to enter into an agreement with the federal reserve to comply with all applicable capital and management requirements which may contain additional limitations or conditions relating to our activities additionally the applicable federal regulatory authority is authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank or

creditors of the respective subsidiaries resolution planning as a bhc with greater than billion of assets the corporation is required by the federal reserve and the fdic to periodically submit a plan for a rapid and orderly resolution in the event of material financial distress or failure such resolution plan is intended to be a detailed roadmap for the orderly resolution of the bhc including the continued operations or solvent wind down of its material entities pursuant to the us bankruptcy code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the bhcs plan is not credible the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on growth activities or operations a summary of our plan is available on the federal reserve and fdic websites the fdic also requires the submission of a resolution plan for bank of america national association bana which must describe how the insured depository institution would be resolved under the bank resolution provisions of the federal deposit insurance act a description of this plan is available on the fdics website we continue to make substantial progress to enhance our resolvability including simplifying our legal entity structure and business operations and increasing our preparedness to implement our resolution plan both from a financial and operational standpoint across international jurisdictions resolution planning is the responsibility of national resolution authorities ra among those the jurisdictions of most impact to the corporation are the requirements associated with subsidiaries in the uk ireland and france where rules have been issued requiring the submission of significant information about locallyincorporated subsidiaries including information on intragroup dependencies legal entity separation and barriers to resolution as well as the corporations banking branches located in those jurisdictions that are deemed to be material for resolution planning purposes as a result of the ras review of the submitted information we could be required to take certain actions over the next several years that could increase operating costs and potentially result in the restructuring of certain businesses and subsidiaries for more

receiver of an insured depository institution if it is insolvent or in certain other circumstances in addition under the financial reform act when a systemically important financial institution sifi such as the corporation is in default or danger of default the fdic may be appointed receiver in order to conduct an orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations the orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the federal deposit insurance act but also adopts certain concepts from the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the us bankruptcy code for example in certain circumstances the fdic could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant eg shortterm table start bank of america table end creditors or operating creditors in lieu of paying other obligations eg longterm creditors without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review the insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a bhcs outstanding equity as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt under the fdics single point of entry strategy for resolving sifis the fdic could replace a distressed bhc with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original bhc furthermore the federal reserve requires that bhcs maintain minimum levels of longterm debt required to provide adequate loss absorbing capacity in the event of a resolution for more information regarding our resolution see item risk factors liquidity on page limitations on acquisitions the riegleneal
