federal reserve regulations require major us bhcs to submit a capital plan as part of an annual comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar our ability to pay dividends and make common stock repurchases depends in part on our ability to maintain regulatory capital levels above minimum requirements plus buffers and noncapital standards established under the fdicia to the extent that the federal reserve increases our stress capital buffer scb global systemically important bank gsib surcharge or countercyclical capital buffer our returns of capital to shareholders including dividends and common stock repurchases could decrease as part of its ccar the federal reserve conducts stress testing on parts of our business using hypothetical economic scenarios prepared by the federal

additionally the corporations gsib surcharge increased to percent on january the federal reserve could also impose limitations or prohibitions on taking capital actions such as paying or increasing

operations or solvent wind down of its material entities pursuant to the us bankruptcy code under one or more hypothetical scenarios assuming no extraordinary government assistance if both the federal reserve and the fdic determine that the bhcs plan is not credible the federal reserve and the fdic may jointly impose more stringent capital leverage or liquidity requirements or restrictions on

orderly liquidation of such institution in the event of such appointment the fdic could among other things invoke the orderly liquidation authority instead of the us bankruptcy code if the secretary of the treasury makes certain financial distress and systemic risk determinations the orderly liquidation authority is modeled in part on the federal deposit insurance act but also adopts certain concepts from the us bankruptcy code the orderly liquidation authority contains certain differences from the us bankruptcy code for example in certain circumstances the fdic could permit payment of obligations it determines to be systemically significant eg shortterm creditors or operating creditors in lieu of paying other obligations eg longterm creditors without the need to obtain creditors consent or prior court review the insolvency and resolution process could also lead to a large reduction or total elimination of the value of a bhcs outstanding equity as well as impairment or elimination of certain debt under the fdics single point of entry strategy for resolving sifis the fdic could replace a distressed bhc with a bridge holding company which could continue operations and result in an orderly resolution of the underlying bank but whose equity is held solely for the benefit of creditors of the original bhc furthermore the federal reserve requires that bhcs maintain
