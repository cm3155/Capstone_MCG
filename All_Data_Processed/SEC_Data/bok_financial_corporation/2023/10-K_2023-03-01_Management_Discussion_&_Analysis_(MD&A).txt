discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report this section and other sections provide information about our recent financial performance for information about results of operations for compared with see the respective sections in managements discussion and analysis included in our form 10k filed february economic conditions have been volatile in with soaring inflation fluctuating oil prices caused by the russiaukraine conflict and the lingering effects of the covid19 pandemic in order to combat rising inflation the federal reserve began increasing the federal funds rate in march and continued to do so through the end of the year for a total basis point increase consumer spending has remained high through and unemployment remains low at for december see summary of credit loss experience section of managements discussion and analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast performance summary net income for the year ended december totaled million or per diluted share compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december preprovision net revenue ppnr a nongaap measure was million for compared to million in the prior year highlights of included net interest revenue totaled billion for an increase of million over the prior year net interest margin was for compared to for in response to rising inflation the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate basis points since the beginning of the year the resulting impact on market interest rates has increased net interest margin as our earning assets led by our significant percentage of variablerate commercial loans reprice at a higher rate and faster pace than our interestbearing liabilities average earning assets were billion for down billion compared to largely due to decreased trading securities fees and commissions revenue was million for a decrease of million compared to mortgage banking revenue decreased million due to a decrease in mortgage production volume caused by rising mortgage interest rates and continued housing inventory shortages other revenue decreased million primarily due to lower production revenue on repossessed oil and gas properties sold in brokerage and trading revenues grew million largely due to increased customer hedging and investment banking revenues fiduciary and asset management revenue increased million with growth in mutual fund fees and decreased fee waivers other gains and losses net decreased million due to sales of an alternative investment and repossessed assets in the prior year other operating expense totaled billion a million decrease compared to personnel expense decreased million primarily driven by lower incentive compensation costs partially offset by higher regular compensation nonpersonnel expense increased million largely due to additional business promotion fees projectrelated data processing and communications and professional fees these were partially offset by lower mortgage banking costs and expenses on repossessed assets the net economic cost of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related economic hedges was million during compared to an economic benefit of million during due to increased market volatility throughout we recorded a million provision for expected credit losses in primarily due to strong growth in loans and loan commitments partially offset by improvement in credit quality metrics the uncertainty in our economic forecast increased and some key economic factors were less favorable to growth across all scenarios a negative million provision for expected credit losses was recorded in the combined allowance for credit losses totaled million or of outstanding loans at december the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at december nonperforming assets not

interest margin was compared to in response to rising inflation the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate another basis points in the fourth quarter the resulting impact on market interest rates increased our net interest margin fees and commissions revenue was relatively consistent with the prior quarter at million increased brokerage and trading revenue transaction card revenue and other revenue was offset by lower revenue from mortgage banking and deposit service charges operating expense increased million to million personnel expense increased million largely driven by higher incentive compensation expense nonpersonnel expense increased million primarily related to projectrelated professional fees and data processing and communications costs we recorded a million provision for expected credit losses in the fourth quarter of primarily due to strong growth in loans and loan commitments the level of uncertainty in the economic outlook remained high and key economic factors in the base case were slightly less favorable to economic growth we also recorded a million provision for expected credit losses in the third quarter of primarily as a result of growth in loans and loan commitments during the quarter critical accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the companys accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with gaap that may be highly subjective complex and subject to variability actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates the following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from loan commitments the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments is determined by a senior management allowance committee which requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise because of the subjective forwardlooking nature of the calculation changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events in future periods management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods on january bok financials accounting policies changed significantly with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no financial instruments credit losses topic assets measured at amortized cost asu or cecl prior years were not restated prior to january general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses see note to the consolidated financial statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments for the majority of riskgraded loans the accruing loans expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario and appropriate adjustments significant assumptions and estimates affecting the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk include probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses probability of default is based on risk grades a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan this subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios are overseen by a senior management economic forecast committee which includes members independent of the allowance process the allowance committee may increase or decrease the allowance to reflect risks not captured in the quantitative component examples of circumstances that may result in adjustments include but are not limited to new lines of business market conditions that have not been previously encountered observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions although the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents managements best estimates at the time actual credit losses will differ from managements estimate portfolio composition will change over time actual economic conditions will differ from probabilityweighted assumptions borrowerspecific circumstances will change as well as other factors differences between actual losses and managements estimates may materially affect the companys results of operations we describe critical elements affecting our estimate of expected credit loss in the summary of credit loss experience section of managements discussion and analysis while it is challenging to evaluate the allowance impact for a change in a particular input results of such an analysis demonstrate how the quantitative element of the allowance behaves under different conditions the sensitivity to managements economic scenario weighting may be quantified by comparing the results of weighting each economic scenario at for example compared to a base case scenario a downside case would result in an additional million in quantitative reserve while a upside case would result in million less in quantitative reserve at december such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the related allowance for a number of reasons including managements weighting of multiple forecasted economic scenarios in estimating expected credit losses managements predictions of future economic trends and relationships among the scenarios may differ from actual events and managements application of subjective measures to modeled results when appropriate fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date an orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale a hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly level and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities level fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a nonrecurring basis fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs level are considered critical accounting policies and estimates additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in notes and of the consolidated financial statements mortgage servicing rights we have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights msrs our msrs are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders msrs may be purchased from other lenders both originated and purchased msrs are initially recognized at fair value we carry all msrs at fair value changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur msrs are not traded in active markets the fair value of msrs is determined by discounting the projected cash flows certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing msrs are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds assumed servicing costs earnings on escrow deposits ancillary income and discount rates assumptions used to value our msrs are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset a separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates housing turnover rates estimated loan curtailment anticipated defaults and other relevant factors the prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio the discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our msrs are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements at least quarterly we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model the assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful considering all related assumptions we expect a basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by million we expect an million decrease in the fair value of our msrs from a basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled billion for an increase of million over the prior year this includes million of ppp loan fees for and million for net interest revenue increased million due to changes in interest rates and decreased million from a decrease in earning assets partially offset by a decrease in interestbearing liabilities table shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and interestbearing liabilities in addition see the annual financial summary of consolidated daily average balances yields and rates as shown in table net interest margin was for and for the taxequivalent yield on earning assets was for compared to in during the federal reserve increased the federal funds rate basis points in response to rising inflation the resulting impact on market interest rates has increased net interest margin as our earning assets led by our significant percentage of variablerate commercial loans reprice at a higher rate and faster pace than our interestbearing liabilities loan yields increased basis points to the available for sale securities portfolio yield increased basis points to the yield on trading securities grew basis points to and the yield on interestbearing cash and cash equivalents increased basis points to

margin from earning assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities was basis points for up from basis points for average earning assets for decreased billion or compared average trading securities balances decreased billion in response to lower origination volumes in the residential mortgage industry driven by increases in mortgage interest rates the average balance of available for sale securities which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by us government agencies decreased billion while investment securities increased billion in the second quarter we transferred billion of us government agency mortgagebacked securities from available for sale to the investment securities portfolio to limit the effect of future rate increases on the tangible common equity ratio average loans net of allowance for loan losses decreased million total average deposits decreased million compared to the prior year average interestbearing transaction account balances decreased billion while average demand deposit balances increased billion average time deposits also decreased million average shortterm borrowings decreased billion our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet in such a way as to limit exposure to changes in interest rates these strategies are further described in the market risk section of this report approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be assetsensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to manage toward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the market risk section of this report table annual financial summary consolidated daily average balances average

combined net interest revenue before provision for credit losses and fees and commission revenue we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile many of these economic factors such as rising interest rates that we expect will result in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading the velocity of changes in market conditions and interest rates may result in timing differences between when offsetting impacts and benefits are realized as interest rates are expected to move higher we expect to experience increased benefits to our net interest margin which provides an offset to reduced mortgagerelated fee income generally for operating revenues not as directly related to movement in interest rates we expect growth to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic conditions including the recent impact of the covid19 pandemic regulatory constraints increased competition and saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases brokerage and trading revenue which includes revenues from trading customer hedging

disruption of the fixed income markets early in this was largely offset by favorable market conditions and increased market volatility which led to higher margins and increased trading activity in the second half of the year see additional discussion in lines of business section of managements discussion and analysis customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in

lines of business commercial banking consumer banking and wealth management commercial banking includes lending treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses middle market and larger commercial customers commercial banking also includes the transfund eft network consumer banking includes retail lending and deposit services lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage loan origination and servicing activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private bank services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business the funds management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds and capital costs credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered the difference between credit costs attributed to the lines of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to funds management in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years in order to appropriately reflect the organizational value of these deposits to the lines of business methodology adjustments are made each january that attribute more or less deposit credit value to the business lines dependent upon historical and forwardlooking interest rate expectations with the offset to funds management and other after several years of decreased funding credits provided to business lines from a sustained low interest rate environment increases in shortterm and longterm rates in response to the federal reserves actions to control inflation caused a commensurate increase in funding credits to business lines in economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts

customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures the effects of changes in commodity prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluated across a range of

required a deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in bok financial recognizing a loss as the fair value of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts this occurs if the credit standing of the customer or counterparty deteriorates such that either the fair value of underlying
