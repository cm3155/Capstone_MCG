analysis to assist in the understanding and evaluation of the financial condition and results of operations of bok financial corporation bok financial or the company this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report after completing its 11th consecutive year of expansion in the us economy experienced extreme volatility throughout the worldwide spread of covid19 affected every part of the economic environment economic conditions in the us declined drastically in march and april of following the initial us covid19 outbreak congress quickly passed the cares act economic relief package which alleviated some of the downturn with the government stimulus package and some time to settle into the current new normal the economy rebounded significantly in the second half of the year the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate to near zero by april and has initiated additional programs to infuse liquidity and stimulate economic activity the federal reserve is expected to keep the federal funds rate at or near zero until the labor market has fully recovered and inflation has stabilized at see summary of credit loss experience section of managements discussion and analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast performance summary net income for the year ended december totaled million or per diluted share compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december a pretax provision for expected credit losses of million was included in while a pretax provision for incurred losses of million was included in the company adopted the current expected credit loss cecl model on january preprovision net revenue a nongaap measure was million for compared to million in the prior year this is a measure of revenue less expenses and is calculated before provision for credit losses and income tax expense preprovision net revenue is a financial measure frequently used by investors and analysts that enables them to assess a companys ability to generate earnings to cover credit losses through a credit cycle it also provides an additional basis for comparing the results of operations between periods by isolating the impact of the provision for credit losses which can vary significantly between periods we incurred million of integration costs in related to the acquisition of cobiz financial inc cobiz on october which resulted in an per share reduction in the fluctuation discussion in the highlights below excludes this impact highlights of included net interest revenue totaled billion for consistent with the prior year net interest margin was for compared to for the federal reserve reduced the federal funds rate to near zero early in the year putting pressure on the margin in average earning assets were billion for up billion over the increase was largely due to increased trading securities loans primarily related to the small business administrations paycheck protection program ppp and the expansion of the available for sale securities portfolio as we repositioned the balance sheet for a lower rate environment fees and commissions revenue was million for up million compared to mortgage banking revenue increased million and brokerage and trading revenue increased million lower mortgage interest rates increased both mortgage loan production and related trading activities these increases were partially offset by a decrease in deposit service charges of million and fiduciary and asset management revenue of million other operating expense totaled billion a million increase compared to personnel expense increased million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense due to expanded trading activities this was partially offset by lower employee benefits costs increased data processing and communications expense occupancy and equipment expense mortgage banking costs and charitable contributions were partially offset by lower business promotions expense the net economic benefit of the changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights

for the fourth quarter of and for the fourth quarter of the increase in the trading securities portfolio combined with the repricing of our available for sale securities portfolio decreased the net interest margin fees and commissions revenue totaled million up million over the fourth quarter of increased mortgage banking revenue stemming from the low interest rate environment was largely offset by decreased brokerage and trading revenue fiduciary and asset management revenue and deposit service charges operating expenses in the fourth quarter totaled million an million increase compared to the prior year personnel expense increased million primarily due to higher incentive compensation expense partially offset by regular compensation expense nonpersonnel expenses increased million largely due to increased data processing and communications expense and higher charitable contributions partially offset by lower business promotion expense based on an evaluation of economic forecasts and loan portfolio characteristics the company recorded a million negative provision for expected credit losses in the fourth quarter of and a million provision for incurred credit losses in the fourth quarter of critical accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the companys accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with gaap that may be highly subjective complex and subject to variability actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates the following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from loan commitments the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments is determined by a senior management allowance committee which requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise because of the subjective forwardlooking nature of the calculation changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events in future periods management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods as of january bok financials accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no financial instruments credit losses topic assets measured at amortized cost asu or cecl prior years are not restated prior to january general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses see note to the consolidated financial statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments for the majority of riskgraded loans the accruing loans expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses probability of default is based on risk grades a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan this subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss other subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios both of which are overseen by a senior management economic forecast committee which includes members independent of the allowance process the allowance committee may increase or decrease the allowance based on factors that include for example new lines of business market conditions that have not been previously encountered observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions although the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents managements best estimates at the time actual credit losses will differ from managements estimate portfolio composition will change over time actual economic conditions will differ from probabilityweighted assumptions borrowerspecific circumstances will change as well as other factors differences between actual losses and managements estimates may materially affect the companys results of operations fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date an orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale a hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly level and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities level fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a nonrecurring basis fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs level are considered critical accounting policies and estimates additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in notes and of the consolidated financial statements mortgage servicing rights we have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders occasionally mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value we carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur mortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds assumed servicing costs earnings on escrow deposits ancillary income and discount rates assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset a separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates housing turnover rates estimated loan curtailment anticipated defaults and other relevant factors the prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio the discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements at least annually we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model the assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful considering all related assumptions we expect a basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by million we expect a million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates valuation of impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets the fair value of collateral for certain impaired loans and real estate and other repossessed assets is measured on a nonrecurring basis the fair value of real estate is generally based on unadjusted thirdparty appraisals derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data fair value measurements based on these appraisals are considered to be based on level inputs fair value measurements based on appraisals that are not based on observable inputs or that require significant adjustments by us or fair value measurements that are not based on thirdparty appraisals are considered to be based on level inputs significant unobservable inputs include listing prices for comparable assets uncorroborated expert opinions or managements knowledge of the collateral or industry the fair value of mineral rights is generally determined by our internal staff of engineers based on projected cash flows from proven oil and gas reserves under existing economic and operating conditions proven oil and gas reserves are estimated quantities that geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs using existing prices and costs projected cash flows incorporate assumptions related to a number of factors including production sales prices operating expenses severance ad valorem taxes capital costs and appropriate discount rate fair values determined through this process are considered to be based on level inputs income taxes determination of income tax expense and related assets and liabilities is complex and requires estimates and judgments when applying tax laws rules regulations and interpretations it also requires judgments as to future earnings and the timing of future events accrued income taxes represent an estimate of net amounts due to or from taxing jurisdictions based upon these estimates interpretations and judgments management evaluates the companys current tax expense or benefit based upon estimates of taxable income tax credits and statutory tax rates annually we file tax returns with each jurisdiction where we conduct business and adjust recognized income tax expense or benefit to filed tax returns we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based upon the differences between the values of assets and liabilities as recognized in the financial statements and their related tax basis using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to be recovered or settled a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion of the entire deferred tax asset may not be realized we also recognize the benefit of uncertain tax positions when based upon all relevant evidence it is morelikelythannot that our position would prevail upon examination including resolution of related appeals or litigation based upon the technical merits of the position unrecognized tax benefits including estimated interest and penalties are part of our current accrued income tax liability estimated penalties and interest are recognized in income tax expense income tax expense in future periods may decrease if an uncertain tax position is favorably resolved generally upon completion of an examination by the taxing authorities expiration of a statute of limitations or changes in facts and circumstances goodwill impairment goodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated for impairment annually as of october 1st or more frequently if conditions indicate that impairment may have occurred the evaluation of possible goodwill impairment involves significant judgment based upon shortterm and longterm projections of future performance during the evaluation for impairment management qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less than their carrying value including goodwill reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements this assessment includes consideration of relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions the financial and stock performance of the company and other relevant factors specifically the analysis may include general economic conditions including overall economic activity consumer spending and mobility unemployment rates consumer confidence and duration and severity of any current market moving instability global health concerns including ongoing pandemics or potential for widespread health issues the future course of a pandemic and the potential for medical advances regional economic conditions including demand for oil and price stability of oil other overarching conditions that may be affecting any of the companys primary states such as weather or other catastrophes pandemics and health related lockdowns or other state mandates industry conditions including federal funds rate movement by the federal reserve the interest rate environment and the resulting effect on net interest revenue and operating revenue and regulatory mandates that hinder or provide relief to the financial services industry company specific conditions including current and forecasted income changes in stock price the companys stock price compared to peers and other indexes book value per share compared to fair value per share goodwill compared to total shareholders equity current capital and liquidity position demand for products and services health of the loan portfolio and other credit related factors and current credit ratings with the ratings agencies and regulatory ratings reporting unit performance and forecasts including any event that may significantly impact a reporting unit if management concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired a quantitative impairment test will be applied to goodwill at all reporting units the quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill the fair value of each reporting unit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of the reporting unit including goodwill both the qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis require significant management judgment including estimates of changes in future economic conditions and their underlying causes and duration the reasonableness and effectiveness of managements responses to those changes changes in governmental fiscal and monetary policies and fair value measurements based largely on significant unobservable inputs the results of these judgments may have a significant impact on the companys reported results of operations see note goodwill and intangible assets for breakout of goodwill by reporting unit results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled billion for consistent with the prior year this includes million of net purchase discount accretion for and million for approximately million of purchase accounting discount remains to be accreted net interest revenue decreased million due to changes in interest rates and increased million from growth in earning assets table shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets and

interest margin was for and for the taxequivalent yield on earning assets was for compared to in in response to the anticipated impact to the economy from the covid19 pandemic the federal reserve

reduce our exposure to falling shortterm interest rates average loans net of allowance for loan losses increased billion primarily related to billion in average ppp loans trading securities balances increased billion total average deposits grew by billion over the prior year this increase is largely due to the combination of focused deposit gathering initiatives stimulusrelated deposits and customers retaining elevated balances in the current economic environment average interestbearing transaction account balances increased billion average demand deposit balances increased billion average shortterm borrowings decreased billion our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report as shown in table approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rateneutral position we purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the market risk section of this report fourth quarter net interest revenue taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the fourth quarter of an increase of million compared to the fourth quarter of net interest revenue increased million primarily due to

significant part of our business strategy and represented of total revenue for excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on asset sales securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile as an example of this strength many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading we expect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in other markets however current and future economic conditions including the impact of the covid19 pandemic regulatory constraints increased competition and

deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage loan origination and servicing activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private bank services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business the funds management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds actual net credit losses and capital costs in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable libor or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on libor or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm libor rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term libor rate and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years during the funds transfer pricing rates for nonmaturity deposits became inverted due to the flattening of the yield curve short term rates continued to increase while long term rates remained relatively flat in order to appropriately reflect the organizational value of these deposits to the lines of business we increased the funding credit to reflect the upward rate moves those adjustments are set annually each january during shortterm rates moved down materially which was reflected in the funding credit to the business lines beginning in january economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business as shown in table following net income attributable to our lines of business decreased million or compared to
