accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states ofamerica gaap the companys accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in the form10k management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes inconformity with gaap that may be highly subjective complex and subject to variability actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions andestimates the following discussion represents significant changes to critical accounting policies and estimates during in the most critical areas where theseassumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company significant changes to critical accountingpolicies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from loan commitments the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loansand related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions as well as reasonableand supportable forecasts of future economic conditions determining appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit riskfrom unfunded loan commitments requires management judgment about effects of uncertain matters resulting in a subjective calculation which contains a certainamount of imprecision because of the subjective forwardlooking nature of the calculation changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actualeconomic events in future periods management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances inthose future periods as of january bok financials accounting policies have changed significantly with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasbaccounting standards update no financial instruments credit losses topic assets measured at amortized cost asu or ceclprior years are not restated prior to january general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses see note to theconsolidated financial statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheetcredit risk from unfunded loan commitments for the majority of riskgraded loans the accruing loans expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment particularly probability of default andloss given default assumptions changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario and judgmentalallocations for risks otherwise not captured in the calculation probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual lossesprobability of default is based on risk grades a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan this subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of lossother subjective measures include the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios both of which areoverseen by a senior management committee with members independent of the allowance process determining appropriateness of the allowance for loan lossesand accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments requires management judgment about effects of uncertain matters which may bereflected as industry or product judgmental allocations or nonspecific allowances this results in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecisealthough the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents managements best estimates at the time actual credit losses will differ from managementsestimate portfolio composition will change over time actual economic conditions will differ from probabilityweighted assumptions borrowerspecificcircumstances will change as well as other factors differences between actual losses and managements estimates may materially affect the companys results ofoperations goodwill impairment goodwill for each reporting unit is evaluated for impairment annually as of october 1st or more frequently if conditions indicate that impairment may haveoccurred the evaluation of possible goodwill impairment involves significant judgment based upon shortterm and longterm projections of future performance during the evaluation for impairment management qualitatively assesses whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting units is less thantheir carrying value including goodwill reporting unit carrying value includes sufficient capital to exceed regulatory requirements this assessment includesconsideration of relevant events and circumstances including but not limited to macroeconomic conditions industry and market conditions the financial and stockperformance of the company and other relevant factors specifically the analysis may include general economic conditions including overall economic activity consumer spending and mobility unemployment rates consumer confidence andduration and severity of any current market moving instability regional economic conditions including demand for oil and price stability of oil other overarching conditions that may be affecting any of the companysprimary states such as

ratings agencies andregulatory ratings reporting unit performance and forecasts including any event that may significantly impact a reporting unit if management concludes based on the qualitative assessment that goodwill may be impaired a quantitative impairment test will be applied to goodwill at allreporting units the quantitative analysis compares the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying value including goodwill the fair value of each reportingunit is estimated by the discounted future earnings method goodwill is considered impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value ofthe reporting unit including goodwill both the qualitative assessment and quantitative analysis require significant management judgment including estimates of changes in future economic conditionsand their underlying causes and duration the reasonableness and effectiveness of managements responses to those changes changes in governmental fiscal andmonetary policies and fair value measurements based largely on significant unobservable inputs the results of these judgments may have a significant impact onthe companys reported results of operations results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and otherborrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is thedifference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greaterthan net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equitytaxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the second quarter of and million in the second quarter of ppp

basispoints for the first quarter of our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet to be relatively neutral to changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risksection of this report approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate or fixed rate that will reprice withinone year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is abalance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities one of the strategies that we use to managetoward a relative rateneutral position is to purchase fixedrate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund themwith marketratesensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio wealso may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interestrate sensitivity projections as shown in the market risk section of this report other operating revenue other operating revenue was million for the second quarter of a million increase over the second quarter of and a million increaseover the first quarter of lower mortgage interest rates have positively affected both our brokerage and trading and mortgage banking revenue leading toincreases of million and million over the second quarter of respectively and million and million over the first quarter of 2020respectively fees and commissions revenue diversified sources of fees and commissions revenue are a significant part of our business strategy and represented percent of total revenue for the secondquarter of excluding provision for credit losses and gains and losses on other assets securities and derivatives and the change in the fair value of mortgageservicing rights we believe that a variety of fee revenue sources provides an offset to changes in interest rates values in the equity markets commodity prices andconsumer spending all of which can be volatile as an example of this strength many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in a decline inmortgage related trading activities and mortgage production volumes may also increase net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue weexpect growth in other operating revenue to come through offering new products and services and by further development of our presence in othermarkets however current and future economic conditions including the recent impact of the covid19 pandemic regulatory constraints increased competitionand saturation in our existing markets could affect the rate of future increases brokerage and trading revenue brokerage and trading revenue which includes revenues from trading customer hedging retail brokerage and investment banking increased million or 53percent compared to the second quarter of trading revenue includes net realized and unrealized gains and losses primarily related to sales of residential mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by usgovernment agencies and related derivative

securities and other financial instruments that we sell to institutional customersalong with changes in the fair value of financial instruments we hold as economic hedges against market risk of our trading securities trading revenue was 439million for the second quarter of a million or percent increase compared to the second quarter of industrywide mortgage loan productiongrew in the second quarter of driven by lower rates as the federal reserve stepped in to provide market stability we increased our bond trading pipeline toprovide greater liquidity to the housing market during a time of record loan production volumes customer hedging revenue is based primarily on realized and unrealized changes in the fair value of derivative contracts held for customer risk managementprograms as more fully discussed under customer derivative programs in note of the consolidated financial statements we offer commodity interest rateforeign exchange and equity derivatives to our customers customer hedging revenue totaled million for the second quarter of an thousand or 17percent increase compared to the second quarter of brokerage and trading revenue increased million compared to the

holding of assets for customers and executing transactions or providing related servicesapproximately percent of fiduciary and asset management revenue is primarily based on the fair value of assets rates applied to asset values vary based on thenature of the relationship fiduciary relationships and managed asset relationships generally have higher fee rates than nonfiduciary andor managed relationshipsfiduciary and asset management revenue decreased million or percent compared to the second quarter of and million compared to the first quarterof the decrease is largely due to the decline in the fair value of average assets combined with the addition of approximately million in fee waivers adistribution of assets under management or administration and related fiduciary and asset management revenue follows mortgage banking revenue mortgage banking revenue increased million or percent compared to the second quarter of mortgage loan production volumes increased 262million

toindustrywide capacity constraints service charges deposit service charges and fees decreased million compared to the second quarter of and million compared to the first quarter of thisdecrease was due in part to shelter in place orders that led to lower activity and also to certain fee waivers in order to help our customers during uncertain timescaused by the pandemic net gains on other assets securities and derivatives other net gains totaled million in the second quarter of compared to other net gains of million in the second quarter of and other net losses of107 million in the first quarter of these fluctuations are primarily related to changes in the fair value of investments related to deferred compensation thatare largely offset in deferred compensation expense the first

changes in primary mortgageloan rates and other assumptions we attempt to mitigate the earnings volatility caused by changes in the fair value of msrs by designating certain financialinstruments as an economic hedge changes in the fair value of these instruments are generally expected to partially offset changes in the fair value of msrs inthe second quarter of we completed a sale of mortgage servicing rights on billion of unpaid principal balance primarily related to loans guaranteed bythe veterans administration this sale was completed to reduce exposure to out of footprint msrs with higher credit risk where no other relationships with theborrower exist the fair value of contracts held as an economic hedge increased in the second quarter of while the fair value of msrs was largely

measure the performance of our business lines after allocation of certain indirect expenses and taxes based onstatutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for fundswith similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable libor or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepaymentand liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that supports assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates forfunds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on libor or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula appliedto deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based

compared to march at june the available for sale securities portfolio consisted primarily of us government agencyresidential mortgagebacked securities and us government agency commercial mortgagebacked securities both residential and commercial mortgagebackedsecurities have credit risk from delinquency or default of the underlying loans we mitigate this risk by primarily investing in securities issued by us governmentagencies principal and interest payments on the underlying loans are fully guaranteed commercial mortgagebacked securities have prepayment penalties similarto commercial loans a primary risk of holding residential mortgagebacked securities comes from extension during periods of rising interest rates or prepayment during periods offalling interest rates we evaluate this risk through extensive modeling of risk both before making an investment and throughout the life of the security our bestestimate of the duration of the combined residential

customer derivative programs we offer programs that permit our customers to hedge various risks including fluctuations in energy cattle and other agricultural product prices interest rates andforeign

selected counterparties to minimize market risk due to changes in commodity pricesinterest rates or foreign exchange rates the counterparty contracts are identical to the customer contracts except for a fixed pricing spread or a fee paid to us ascompensation for administrative costs credit risk and profit the customer derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our customers and from the counterparties customer creditrisk is monitored through existing credit policies and procedures the effects of changes in commodity prices interest rates or foreign exchange rates are evaluatedacross a range of possible scenarios to determine the maximum exposure we are willing to have individually to any customer customers may also be required toprovide cash

limits may be reduced and additional margin collateral may be required a deterioration of the credit standing of one or more of the customers or counterparties to these contracts may result in bok financial recognizing a loss as the fairvalue of the affected contracts may no longer move in tandem with the offsetting contracts this occurs if the credit standing of the customer or

derivative assets these risks are modeled as part of the management of these programs based on current prices a decrease in marketprices equivalent to per barrel of oil would not be great enough to create a scenario in which we are owed by our customers this is due to the price of oilbeing within the weighted average fixed price of the portfolio rather we would be owed by the counterparties however due to our margining status withcounterparties one would not see any impact here an increase in prices equivalent to per barrel of oil would increase the fair value of derivative assets by127 million as margin received falls faster than the asset values further increases in price to the equivalent of per barrel of oil would increase the fairvalue of our derivative assets by million with lending customers comprising the bulk of the assets liquidity requirements of this program may also beaffected by our credit rating at june a decrease in our credit rating to below investment grade

activities during the second quarter the company sold certain mortgage servicing rights related to residential mortgage loans transferred tomortgagebacked securities these servicing rights expose the company to credit risk for amounts that exceed the us government agency guarantees the civilian unemployment rate is used in estimating expected credit losses for a number of our portfolios because historically it has been a good indicator offinancial difficulty the upward change in unemployment rates during the first half of was unprecedented and has been considered within the context of thegovernments response through the cares act these enacted economic stimulus programs which expire in the third quarter of have increased benefitsavailable and broadened definitions of those eligible for unemployment benefits as a result the historical relationship between unemployment rates and creditlosses is currently not a reliable indicator of future expected credit losses instead management developed a forecast for civilian unemployment rates then analyzedthe effect of enacted economic stimulus this analysis showed current expected credit losses are likely more similar to unemployment rates to percentagepoints lower than forecasted rates we reduced the base case forecasted civilian unemployment rate for the third quarter of to percent the downside caseto percent and the upside case to percent management took a similar approach in estimating the impact of possible future government stimulus programs deployed after the third quarter of for theremainder of the forecast period expected credit losses are likely to be more similar to unemployment rates that are percentage point lower than forecasted ratescausing management to reduce its estimate of expected credit losses through a qualitative adjustment of million the second quarter provision for credit losses was also affected by changes in risk grading a summary of loans by risk grade is included in note to

nonpass graded energy loans totaled billion at june a716 million increase from march the recent oil price decline coupled with the capital markets environment requiring certain customers to work through theirliquidity needs weighed on some energy borrowers the forward price curve for energy particularly oil remained depressed throughout most of the secondquarter but recovered somewhat in june this risk grade migration was realized as we completed most of our energy borrowing base redeterminations in april andmay prices have improved since but do remain fragile and closely tied to the continued economic recovery should current price levels hold into our next semiannual borrowing base redetermination in the fall we would anticipate positive credit quality migration in this portfolio although fiscal stimulus through ppp sba support and other cares act programs have had a positive impact on credit quality we received a number of deferralor forbearance requests early in the second

due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument these changes may be the result ofvarious factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices or equity prices financial instruments that are subject to market risk can beclassified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading market risk excludes changes in fair value due to the credit of the individual issuers offinancial instruments bok financial is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on both its assets held for purposes other than trading and tradingassets the effects of other changes such as foreign exchange rates commodity prices or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to bok financial bokfinancial has no material investments in assets that are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices energy and agricultural product derivativecontracts which are affected by changes in commodity prices are matched against offsetting contracts as previously discussed the assetliability committee is responsible for managing market risk in accordance with policy limits established by the board of directors the committeemonitors projected variation in net interest revenue net income and economic value of equity due to specified changes in interest rates these limits also setmaximum levels for shortterm borrowings shortterm assets public funds and brokered deposits and establish minimum levels for unpledged assets among otherthings further the board approved market risk limits for fixed income trading mortgage pipeline and mortgage servicing assets inclusive of economic hedgebenefits exposure is measured daily and compliance is reviewed monthly deviations from the board approved limits which periodically occur throughout thereporting period may require management to develop and execute plans to reduce exposure these plans are subject to escalation to and approval by the boardthe simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effects of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent ofrepricing characteristics future cash flows and customer behavior these assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result models cannot precisely estimate orprecisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interestrate changes market conditions and management strategies among other factors interest rate risk other than trading as previously noted in the net interest revenue section of this report management has implemented strategies to manage the companys balance sheet to haverelatively limited exposure to changes in interest rates over a twelvemonth period the effectiveness of these strategies in managing the overall interest rate risk isevaluated through the use of an assetliability model bok financial performs a sensitivity analysis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures includingembedded option positions on net interest revenue a simulation model is used to estimate the effect of changes in interest rates on our performance acrossmultiple interest rate scenarios our current internal policy limit for net interest revenue variation due to a basis point parallel change in market interest ratesover twelve months is a maximum decline of percent the results of a decrease in interest rates in the current lowrate environment are not meaningful the companys primary interest rate exposures include the federal funds rate which affects shortterm borrowings and the prime lending rate and libor whichare the basis for much of the variable rate loan pricing additionally residential mortgage rates directly affect the prepayment speeds for residential mortgagebacked securities and mortgage servicing rights derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used for purposes other than trading are includedin this simulation in addition the impact on the level and composition of demand deposit accounts and other core deposit balances resulting from a significantincrease in shortterm market interest rates and the overall interest rate environment is likely to be material the simulation incorporates assumptions regarding theeffects of such changes based on a combination of historical analysis and expected behavior the impact of planned growth and new business activities is factoredinto the simulation model bok financial is also subjected to market risk through
