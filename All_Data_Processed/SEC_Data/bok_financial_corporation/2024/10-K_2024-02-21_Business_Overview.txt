supervision and prudential standards applicable to bank holding companies with consolidated assets of billion or more and nonbank covered companies designated as systematically important to the financial stability oversight council often referred to as systemically important financial institutions the doddfrank act mandated that certain regulatory requirements applicable to systemically important financial institutions be more stringent than those applicable to other financial institutions subsequent legislation raised the threshold for systemically important financial institutions from billion to billion while providing the federal reserve board with authority to establish incremental prudential standards for banks between billion and billion current rules adopted by the occ require heightened standards for financial institutions that report at least billion of average consolidated assets over a four quarter period after an 18month grace period these heightened standards require establishing and implementing a risk governance framework to cover the banks risktaking activities consumer financial protection we are subject to a number of federal and state consumer

savings act the electronic fund transfer act the expedited funds availability act the home mortgage disclosure act the fair housing act the real estate settlement procedures act the fair debt

obtain these and other remedies including regulatory sanctions customer rescission rights action by the state and local attorneys general in each jurisdiction in which we operate and civil money penalties failure to comply with consumer protection requirements may also damage our reputation and result in our failure to obtain any required bank regulatory approval for merger or acquisition transactions we may wish to pursue or our prohibition from engaging in such transactions even if approval is not required the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority for a wide range of consumer financial laws that apply to all banks including among other things the authority to prohibit unfair deceptive or abusive acts and practices abusive acts or practices are defined as those that materially interfere with a consumers ability to understand a term or condition of a consumer financial product or service or take unreasonable advantage of a consumers i lack of financial savvy ii inability to

at least satisfactory in its most recent examination under the cra furthermore banking regulators take into account cra ratings when considering a request for an approval of a proposed transaction bokf na received a rating of outstanding in its most recent cra examination which is above satisfactory financial privacy the federal banking regulators adopted rules that limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties these limitations require disclosure of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain personal information to a nonaffiliated third party these regulations affect how consumer information is transmitted through diversified financial companies and is conveyed to outside parties capital adequacy and prompt corrective action the federal reserve board the occ and the fdic have issued substantially similar riskbased and leverage capital guidelines applicable to united states banking organizations to ensure capital adequacy based upon the risk levels of assets and offbalance sheet financial instruments in addition these regulatory agencies may from time to time require that a banking organization maintain capital above the minimum levels whether because of its financial condition or actual or anticipated growth capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations involve quantitative measures of assets liabilities and certain offbalance sheet items calculated under regulatory accounting practices capital amounts and classifications are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators regarding components risk weighting and other factors federal reserve board riskbased guidelines define four capital metrics based on three categories of regulatory capital cet1 includes common shareholders equity less goodwill most intangible assets and other adjustments tier capital consists of cet1 capital plus certain additional capital instruments and related surplus tier consists of preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital qualifying mandatory convertible debt securities limited amounts of subordinated debt other qualifying term debt and allowances for credit losses subject to limitations assets and offbalance sheet exposures are assigned to categories of riskweights based primarily upon relative credit risk riskbased capital ratios are calculated by dividing cet1 tier and total capital by riskweighted assets in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the company is also subject to the leverage ratio the leverage ratio is determined by dividing tier capital by adjusted average total assets additional capital rules were effective for banks and bank holding companies including bok financial on january as part of a package of regulatory reforms developed by the bcbs to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector commonly referred to as the basel iii framework failure to meet minimum capital requirements would be subject to regulatory restrictions on capital distributions including but not limited to dividends and share repurchases and executive bonus payments the fdicia among other things identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions from well capitalized to critically undercapitalized and requires the respective federal regulatory agencies to implement systems for prompt corrective action for institutions failing to meet minimum capital requirements within such categories fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive covenants on operations management and capital distributions depending upon the category in which an institution is classified the various regulatory agencies have adopted substantially similar regulations that define the five capital categories identified by fdicia using the total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital and leverage capital ratios as the relevant capital measures such regulations establish various degrees of corrective action to be taken when an institution is considered undercapitalized stress testing the regulatory relief act eliminated the requirement for periodic company run capital stress tests known as the doddfrank act stress test for banks with assets less than billion although the mandate has been lifted the company still continues to perform capital stress testing on a regular basis executive and incentive compensation guidelines adopted by federal banking agencies prohibit excessive compensation as an unsafe and unsound practice and describe compensation as excessive when the amounts paid are unreasonable or disproportionate to the services performed by an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder the federal reserve board has issued comprehensive guidance on incentive compensation intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies do not undermine safety and soundness by encouraging excessive risk taking this guidance covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group based on key principles that i incentives do not encourage risktaking beyond the organizations ability to identify and manage risk ii compensation arrangements are compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii compensation arrangements are supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective board oversight deficiencies in compensation practices may affect supervisory ratings and enforcement actions may be taken if incentive compensation arrangements pose a risk to safety and soundness deposit insurance substantially all of the deposits held by the subsidiary banks are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act established a plan in september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of percent within eight years this plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate based on the fdics recent projections however the fdic determined that the dif reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of september without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates on october the fdic finalized a rule that increased the initial base deposit insurance assessment rates by basis points beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of the increased assessment improves the likelihood that the dif reserve ratio would reach the required minimum by the statutory deadline consistent with the fdics amended restoration plan the rule became effective as of january on november the fdic approved a final rule to implement a special assessment on certain banking organizations with financial institution subsidiaries with more than billion in assets in order to recover the costs associated with protecting uninsured depositors following the closures of silicon valley bank and signature bank in march the special assessment will be collected beginning with the first quarterly assessment period of at an annual rate of approximately basis points for an anticipated total of eight quarterly periods and is subject to periodic adjustments the assessment base is equal to uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the

title vi of the doddfrank act commonly known as the volcker rule prohibits the company from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for our own account and having certain ownership interests in or relationships with private equity or hedge funds the fundamental prohibitions of the volcker rule apply to banking entities of any size including the company and its bank subsidiary trading activity
