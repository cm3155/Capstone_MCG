item risk factors bok financial corporation and its subsidiaries could be adversely affected by risks and uncertainties that could have a material impact on its financial condition and results of operations as well as on its common stock and other financial instruments risk factors which are significant to the company include but are not limited to strategic compliance and regulatory risk factors adverse factors could impact bok financials ability to implement its operating strategy although bok financial has developed an operating strategy which it expects to result in continuing improved financial performance bok financial cannot ensure that it will be successful in fulfilling this strategy or that this operating strategy will be successful achieving success is dependent upon a number of factors many of which are beyond bok financials direct control factors that may adversely affect bok financials ability to implement its operating strategy include deterioration of bok financials asset quality deterioration in general economic conditions especially in bok financials core markets inability to control bok financials noninterest expenses inability to increase noninterest income inability to access capital decreases in net interest margins increases in competition a breach in the security of bok financials systems and adverse regulatory developments substantial competition could adversely affect bok financial banking is a competitive business bok financial competes actively for loan deposit and other financial services business in the southwest region of the united states bok financials competitors include a large number of small and large local and national banks savings and loan associations credit unions trust companies brokerdealers and underwriters as well as many financial and nonfinancial firms that offer services similar to those of bok financial large national financial institutions have substantial capital technology and marketing resources such large financial institutions may have greater access to capital at a lower cost than bok financial does which may adversely affect bok financials ability to compete effectively bok financial has expanded into markets outside of oklahoma where it competes with a large number of financial institutions that have an established customer base and greater market share than bok financial with respect to some of its services bok financial competes with nonbank companies that are not subject to regulation the absence of regulatory requirements may give nonbanks a competitive advantage the increasingly competitive environment is in part a result of changes in regulation changes in technology and product delivery systems and the accelerating pace of consolidation among financial service providers our success depends on our ability to respond to the threats and opportunities of financial technology innovations developments in fintech and cryptocurrencies have the potential to disrupt the financial industry and change the way banks do business investment in new technology to stay competitive could result in significant costs and increased cybersecurity risk our success depends on our ability to adapt to the pace of the rapidly changing technological environment which is important to retention and acquisition of customers government regulations and political environment could adversely affect bok financial bok financial and bokf na are subject to banking laws and regulations that limit the type of acquisitions and investments that we may make in addition certain permitted acquisitions and investments are subject to prior review and approval by banking regulators including the federal reserve occ and fdic banking regulators have broad discretion on whether to approve proposed acquisitions and investments in deciding whether to approve a proposed acquisition federal banking regulators will consider among other things the effect of the acquisition on competition the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including our record of compliance under the community reinvestment act and our effectiveness in combating money laundering they will also consider our financial condition and our future prospects including projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of our management and our record of compliance with laws and regulations regulatory authorities may change their interpretation of these statutes and regulations including the occ our primary regulator and the cfpb our regulator for certain designated consumer laws and regulations violations of laws and regulations could limit the growth potential of bok financials businesses we have made extensive investments in human and technological resources to address enhanced regulatory expectations including investments in the areas of risk management compliance and capital planning political developments including recent federal executive and legislative changes add additional uncertainty to the implementation scope and timing of changes in the regulatory environment for the banking industry and for the broader economy concern regarding the ability of congress and the president to reach agreement on federal budgetary matters including the debt ceiling or prolonged stalemates leading to total or partial governmental shutdowns may also have adverse economic consequences and create the risk of economic instability or market volatility with potential negative consequences to our business and financial performance additionally changes in fiscal monetary or regulatory policy including as a result of labor shortages wage pressures supply chain disruptions and higher inflation could increase our compliance costs and adversely affect our business operations and results of operations federal budget deficit concerns and the potential for political conflict over legislation to raise the us governments debt limit may increase the possibility of a default by the us government on its debt obligations related creditrating downgrades or an economic recession in the united states many of our investment securities are issued by the us government and government agencies and sponsored entities as a result of uncertain domestic political conditions including potential future federal government shutdowns the possibility of the federal government defaulting on its obligations for a period of time due to debt ceiling limitations or other unresolved political issues investments in financial instruments issued or guaranteed by the federal government pose liquidity risks in connection with prior political disputes over us fiscal and budgetary issues leading to the us government shutdown in sp lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the us from aaa to aa on august fitch ratings announced its decision to downgrade the us longterm credit ratings from aaa to aa but maintained the country credit ceiling at aaa a further downgrade or a downgrade by other rating agencies as well as sovereign debt issues facing the governments of other countries could have a material adverse impact on financial markets and economic conditions in the us and worldwide the effects of climate change and resulting government regulations could adversely affect bok financial and bok financial customers the current and anticipated effects of climate change have resulted in increased political and social attention climate changes present physical and transition risks to bok financial both of which are expected to increase over time physical risks relate to the harm of people or property arising from acute climaterelated disaster events such as hurricanes or tornadoes as well as longerterm chronic phenomena such as higher average temperatures physical risks specific to bok financial include increases in extreme weather events could damage or destroy the property of bok financial or its customers disrupting operations and causing significant expenditures significant damages to real properties securing our loans could cause the value of the loan portfolio to contract borrowers may be unable to make payments on loans increasing delinquency rates and average loan loss severity wideranging weather disasters including but not limited to long periods of drought and rising sea levels could result in an economic downturn and a decline in market conditions liquidity risks could arise as operational needs change for both bok financial and its customers we may not have adequate insurance coverage for some potential natural catastrophic climate changerelated events transition risks relate to stresses arising from the shifts in regulatory policies consumer or business sentiment or technologies required to limit climate change the us congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies have continued to propose and advance numerous legislative and regulatory initiatives seeking to mitigate the effects of climate change transition risks specific to bok financial include compliance operating maintenance and remediation costs may require a significant amount of capital affecting bok financials liquidity position bok financials credit portfolios include carbonintensive industries which could be adversely impacted by the transition to a lowcarbon economy bok financial has a longstanding relationship with the energy industry and the local economies within bok financials geographical footprint have a concentration in energyrelated industries the regulatory impacts on the energy industry could lead to sharp changes in the values of certain assets or liabilities increase costs hinder financial results and shrink the industry these changes could have a significant effect on the general economic conditions within our footprint reputational risk may increase as stakeholders become more focused on climate risk credit risk factors adverse regional economic developments could negatively affect bok financials business at december loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in texas represented approximately of the total loan portfolio loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in oklahoma represented approximately of our total loan portfolio and loans to businesses and individuals with collateral primarily located in colorado represented approximately of our total loan portfolio these geographic concentrations subject the loan portfolio to the general economic conditions within these areas poor economic conditions in texas oklahoma colorado or other markets in the southwest region may cause bok financial to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in bok financials loan portfolio a regional economic downturn could also adversely affect revenue from brokerage and trading activities mortgage loan originations and other sources of feebased revenue extended oil and gas commodity price downturns could negatively affect bok financial customers at december of bok financials total loan portfolio is comprised of loans to borrowers in the energy industry the energy industry is historically cyclical and prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices could negatively impact borrowers ability to pay in addition the company does business in several major oil and natural gas producing states including oklahoma texas and colorado the economies of these states could be negatively impacted by prolonged periods of low oil and gas commodity prices resulting in increased credit migration to classified and nonaccruing categories higher loan loss provisions and risk of credit losses from both energy borrowers and businesses and individuals in those regional economies other adverse economic factors affecting particular industries including commercial real estate and healthcare could have a negative effect on bok financial customers and their ability to make payments to bok financial certain industryspecific economic factors also affect bok financial for example bok financials loan portfolio includes commercial real estate loans these types of loans may expose a lender to a higher degree of credit risk of nonpayment or loss as commercial real estate loans are subject to cyclical downturns are generally more sensitive to interest rates and usually do not fully amortize over the loan term a downturn in the real estate industry in general or in certain segments of the commercial real estate industry could also have an adverse effect on bok financials operations the development of remote work or hybrid work models may cause volatility in vacancy rates and rents in certain urban markets weakening of the commercial real estate market may increase the likelihood of default of these loans which could negatively impact our loan portfolios performance and asset quality if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values we could incur material losses regulatory changes in healthcare may negatively affect our customers legislation affecting reimbursement rates along with the continued transition to managed care in place of fee for service payments could affect their ability to pay liquidity price and interest rate risk factors fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect bok financials business bok financials business is highly sensitive to the monetary policies implemented by the federal reserve board including the discount rate on bank borrowings and changes in reserve requirements which affect bok financials ability to make loans and the interest rates we may charge changes in prevailing interest rates due to the dependency of the subsidiary bank on interest income changes in depositor behavior and open market operations in us government securities a significant increase in market interest rates or the perception that an increase may occur could adversely affect both bok financials ability to originate new loans and bok financials ability to grow conversely a decrease in interest rates could result in acceleration in the payment of loans including loans underlying bok financials holdings of residential mortgagebacked securities and termination of bok financials mortgage servicing rights in addition changes in market interest rates changes in the relationships between shortterm and longterm market interest rates or changes in the relationships between different interest rate indices could affect the interest rates charged on interestearning assets differently than the interest rates paid on interestbearing liabilities this difference could result in an increase in interest expense relative to interest income which would reduce the companys net interest revenue in a rising interest rate environment the composition of the deposit portfolio could shift resulting in a mix that is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than is the current mix deposit repricing behavior may also differ from our models or from previous rate increases an increase in market interest rates also could adversely affect the ability of bok financials floatingrate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations if this occurred it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs which could adversely affect bok financials business changes in mortgage interest rates could adversely affect mortgage banking operations along with mortgage servicing rights as well as bok financials substantial holdings of residential mortgagebacked securities and brokerage and trading revenue bok financial derives a substantial amount of revenue from mortgage banking activities the production and sale of mortgage loans and the servicing of mortgage loans in addition as part of bok financials mortgage banking business bok financial has substantial holdings of mortgage servicing rights revenue generated from the production and sale of mortgage loans is affected by mortgage interest rates and government policies related to economic stimulus and home ownership falling interest rates tend to increase mortgage lending activities and related revenue while rising interest rates have an opposite effect mortgage servicing revenue is a fee earned over the life of the related loan however mortgage servicing rights are assets that are carried at fair value which are very sensitive to numerous factors with the primary factor being changes in market interest rates falling interest rates tend to increase loan prepayments which may lead to a decrease in the value of related servicing rights we attempt to manage this risk by maintaining an active hedging program the primary objective of the companys hedging program is to provide an offset to changes in the fair value of these rights due to hedgeable risks primarily changes in market interest rates due to numerous unhedgeable factors hedging strategies may not offset all changes in the fair value of the asset such unhedgeable factors include but are not limited to changes in customer prepayment or delinquency behavior that is inconsistent with historical actual performance in a similar market environment changes in the longterm or shortterm primarysecondary mortgage spreads and changes in surveydriven assumptions such as the cost of servicing and discount rates we also hold a substantial portfolio of residential mortgagebacked securities issued by us government agencies the fair value of residential mortgagebacked securities is highly sensitive to changes in interest rates a significant decrease in interest rates may lead mortgage holders to refinance the mortgages constituting the pool backing the securities subjecting bok financial to a risk of prepayment and decreased return on investment due to subsequent reinvestment at lower interest rates a significant decrease in interest rates may also accelerate premium amortization conversely a significant increase in interest rates may cause mortgage holders to extend the term over which they repay their loans which delays the companys opportunity to reinvest funds at higher rates we mitigate this risk somewhat by investing principally in shorter duration mortgage products which are less sensitive to changes in interest rates however this strategy may not be successful in addition the company actively engages in trading activities that provide us government agency residential mortgagebacked securities and related derivative instruments to our customers trading activities generate net interest revenue and trading revenue trading revenue and customer hedging revenue varies in response to customer demand the value of trading securities will increase in response to decreases in interest rates or decrease in response to increases in interest rates and other bond market factors we mitigate the market risk of holding trading securities through appropriate economic hedging techniques which may not be effective models may fail to reasonably predict changes in values caused by changes in interest rates prepayment speeds and other relevant stimuli which could adversely affect our business or results of operations we use quantitative models to assist in measuring risk and predicting changes in the value of financial instruments the outputs of these models are used to determine hedging strategy related to mortgage servicing rights mortgage production pipeline and trading securities we also use models to estimate the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures in order to adequately structure assets and liabilities to manage interest rate sensitivity inaccurate information obtained from these models could result in poor management decisions that lead to an elevated exposure to interest rates which could adversely affect our results of operations market disruptions could impact bok financials funding sources bok financials subsidiary bank may rely on other financial institutions and the federal home loan bank of topeka as a significant source of funds our ability to fund loans manage our interest rate risk and meet other obligations depends on funds borrowed from these sources the inability to borrow funds at market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our operations in addition idiosyncratic factors as well as other factors outside of bok financials control such as a general market disruption or an operational problem that affects third parties could impair the companys ability to access shortterm funding or create an unforeseen outflow of cash due to among other factors draws on unfunded commitments or deposit attrition withdrawals of brokered or institutional deposits could require us to pay significantly higher interest rates on our retail deposits or on other wholesale funding sources which would have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net income furthermore changes to the fhlbs underwriting guidelines for wholesale borrowings or lending policies may limit or restrict our ability to borrow and therefore could have a significant adverse impact on our liquidity in the event of future turmoil in the banking industry or other idiosyncratic events there is no guarantee that the us government will invoke the systemic risk exception create additional liquidity programs or take any other action to stabilize the banking industry or provide liquidity the companys inability to monetize liquid assets or to access shortterm funding or capital markets could constraint the companys ability to make new loans or meet existing lending commitments and could ultimately jeopardize bok financials overall liquidity and capitalization loss of deposits or a change in deposit mix could increase bok financials funding costs deposits are a low cost and stable source of funding bok financial competes with banks and other financial institutions for deposits and as a result the company could lose deposits in the future clients may shift their deposits into higher cost products or the company may need to raise interest rates to avoid deposit attrition funding costs may also increase if deposits lost are replaced with wholesale funding higher funding costs reduce bok financials net interest margin net interest income and net income in addition recent events impacting the banking industry including the bank failures in march and april have resulted in significant disruption and volatility in the capital markets reduced current valuations of bank securities and decreased confidence in banks among depositors and other counterparties as well as investors a decrease in the supply of deposits or significant increase in competition for deposits could result in substantial increases in costs to retain and service deposits increased adoption of consumer banking technology can result in reduced deposit stickiness due to the relative ease with which depositors may transfer deposits to a different depository institution in the event that confidence is lost in bokf na the cost of resolving the recent bank failures has also prompted the fdic to issue a special assessment to recover costs to the deposit insurance fund for information on the fdics special assessment refer to the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations a downgrade in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs and limit our business activities we are regularly evaluated by ratings agencies our credit ratings are based on a number of factors such as the financial strength of bokf and bokf na and conditions generally affecting the financial services industry many qualitative and quantitative factors are used by the ratings agencies including capital adequacy liquidity asset quality business mix and earnings these ratings are subject to change at any time and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings reductions in one or more of our credit ratings could adversely affect our ability to borrow funds and increase our cost of capital and limit the number of investors or counterparties willing to do business with or lend to us this could also affect our ability to attract or retain customers including deposits in addition if we were downgraded below investment grade certain counterparty contracts may require renegotiation or require additional posting of collateral operating and transaction risk factors dependence on technology increases cybersecurity data privacy and technology failure risk the company is dependent on its technological ability to process record and monitor a large number of customer transactions and store and protect a significant amount of sensitive customer information our customers use of our internetbased services and our customer and regulatory expectations regarding operational and information security and reliability have increased over time we face compliance risks and costs relating to the data privacy laws existing in multiple jurisdictions congress and the legislatures of states in which we operate regularly consider legislation that would impose more stringent data privacy requirements resulting in increased compliance costs cybersecurity risks for financial institutions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies the increased use of the internet and mobile technologies to conduct financial transactions and the increased sophistication and ever changing cyberattack techniques used by organized crime hackers terrorists hostile foreign governments and other external parties to obtain confidential customer information and misappropriate customer funds and may disrupt operations through ransomware such parties may seek to gain access to our systems directly or use equipment or security passwords belonging to employees customers thirdparty services providers or other users of our systems accordingly our operational systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions breakdowns and cyber attacks our business financial accounting data processing systems and other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled as a result of a number of factors that may be wholly or partially beyond our control in addition to cyber attacks there could be sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical or telecommunications outages extended disruptions in operations or technology natural disasters pandemics and events arising from political or social matters including terrorist attacks third parties with whom we do business or that facilitate our business activities including exchanges clearing houses financial intermediaries or vendors that provide services or security solutions for our operations could also be sources of operational or information security risk to the company including breakdowns or failures of their own systems capacity constraints or cyber attacks cybersecurity risk management programs are expensive to maintain and will not protect the company from all risks associated with maintaining the security of customer data from external and internal intrusions disaster recovery and failures in controls used by our vendors a material breach of customer data security or operational or system failure may negatively impact our business reputation and cause a loss of customers result in increased expense to contain the event andor require that we provide credit monitoring services for or reimburse affected customers result in regulatory fines penalties or intervention or result in litigation all of which could have a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition although to date we have not experienced any material losses relating to cyber attacks or other information security breaches or operational failures there can be no assurance that we will not suffer such losses in the future attempts to compromise our cybersecurity are regular and frequent our risk and exposure to these matters remains heightened and as a result the continued development and enhancement of our controls processes and practices designed to protect and facilitate the recovery of our systems computers software data and networks from attack damage or unauthorized access remains a high priority for us as an additional layer of protection we have purchased network and privacy liability risk insurance coverage our cybersecurity insurance may not provide sufficient coverage in the event of a breach or may not be available in the future on acceptable terms we depend on third parties for critical components of our infrastructure we outsource a significant portion of our information systems communications data management and transaction processing to third parties we are heavily reliant on a single vendor for many of these functions these third parties are sources of risk associated with operational errors system interruptions or breaches unauthorized disclosure of confidential information and misuse of intellectual property if the service providers encounter any of these issues we could be exposed to disruption of service reputation damages and litigation risk that could be material to our business we may be adversely affected and experience losses related to fraud or theft attempts to commit fraud including but not limited to card fraud check fraud electronic fraud wire fraud social engineering and phishing attacks are becoming increasingly more sophisticated and may go undetected by the systems and procedures we have in place to monitor our operations we have experienced and may experience again in the future losses incurred due to customer employee or thirdparty fraud and theft these losses may be material negatively affect our results of operations financial condition or prospects and may lead to significant reputational risks and other effects we continue to invest in fraud prevention in the form of people and systems designed to prevent detect and mitigate the customer and financial impacts recent events impacting the financial services industry could adversely affect bok financials business recent events affecting the financial services industry have generated significant market volatility among publicly traded bank holding companies with particular focus on regional banks these events occurred following a period of rapidly rising interest rates which resulted in unrealized losses in longer duration securities and loans held by banks as well as more competition for bank deposits these recent events have and may continue to adversely impact the market price and volatility of the companys stock potentially adverse changes to laws or regulations governing banks and bank holding companies may occur including but not limited to new regulations directed towards banks of similar size in areas such as deposit composition the level of uninsured deposits brokered deposits unrealized losses in securities portfolios liquidity cre composition and concentration and capital which could increase the costs of doing business the company could also face increased scrutiny or be viewed as higher risk by regulators and the investor community which could negatively affect our future results as a result of recent bank failures the fdic proposed and finalized a special assessment to replenish the deposit insurance fund which increased fdic insurance premiums above the recently increased levels which will result in higher costs risks related to an investment in our stock although publicly traded bok financials common stock has substantially less liquidity than the average trading market for a stock quoted on the nasdaq national market system a relatively small fraction of bok financials outstanding common stock is actively traded the risks of low liquidity include increased volatility of the price of bok financials common stock low liquidity may also limit holders of bok financials common stock in their ability to sell or transfer bok financials shares at the price time and quantity desired bok financials principal shareholder controls a majority of bok financials common stock mr george b kaiser owns approximately of the outstanding shares of bok financials common stock at december mr kaiser is able to elect all of bok financials directors and effectively control the vote on all matters submitted to a vote of bok financials common shareholders mr kaisers ability to prevent an unsolicited bid for bok financial or any other change in control could have an adverse effect on the market price for bok financials common stock a substantial majority of bok financials directors are not officers or employees of bok financial or any of its affiliates however because of mr kaisers control over the election of bok financials directors he could change the composition of bok financials board of directors so that it would not have a majority of outside directors possible future sales of shares by bok financials principal shareholder could adversely affect the market price of bok financials common stock mr kaiser has the right to sell shares of bok financials common stock in compliance with the federal securities laws at any time or from time to time the federal securities laws will be the only restrictions on mr kaisers ability to sell because of his current control of bok financial mr kaiser could sell large amounts of his shares of bok financials common stock by causing bok financial to file a registration statement that would allow him to sell shares more easily in addition mr kaiser could sell his shares of bok financials common stock without registration under rule of the securities act although bok financial can make no predictions as to the effect if any that such sales would have on the market price of bok financials common stock sales of substantial amounts of bok financials common stock or the perception that such sales could occur could adversely affect market prices if mr kaiser sells or transfers his shares of bok financials common stock as a block another person or entity could become bok financials controlling shareholder statutory restrictions on subsidiary dividends and other distributions and debts of bok financials subsidiaries could limit amounts bok financials subsidiaries may pay to bok financial a substantial portion of bok financials cash flow typically comes from dividends paid by bokf na statutory provisions and regulations restrict the amount of dividends bokf na may pay to bok financial without regulatory approval management also developed and the bok financial board of directors approved an internal capital policy that is more restrictive than the regulatory capital standards in the event of liquidation creditors of the subsidiary banks and other nonbank subsidiaries of bok financial are entitled to receive distributions from the assets of that subsidiary before bok financial as holder of an equity interest in the subsidiaries is entitled to receive any distributions general risk factors our business may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees an increasing competitive factor in the financial services industry is the ability to attract and retain talented and diverse employees across several lines of business the transition by many employers to remote work and workfromhome that occurred during the covid19 pandemic seems likely to continue employers now less constrained by physical geography particularly those in markets with elevated employee compensation may increasingly compete for our employees adverse global economic factors could have a negative effect on bok financial customers and counterparties economic conditions globally could impact bok financials customers and counterparties with which we do business pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic may affect economies around the world the russiaukraine conflict and israelhamas conflict have resulted in volatile oil prices as well as affected other global economic factors bok financial its customers and counterparties may be negatively affected by the volatility and uncertainty related to inflation and the effects of inflation prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively affecting our fixed costs and expenses including increasing funding costs and expenses related to talent acquisition and retention additionally inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer purchasing power and negatively impact the need or demand for our products or services if significant inflation continues the creditworthiness of our borrowers and their ability to repay loans timely may be affected the company its customers and counterparties may also be adversely affected by global events such as natural disasters and other external events beyond our control including public health issues terrorist attacks and acts of war these global events may significantly affect longterm and shortterm interest rates energy prices the value of financial assets and ultimately economic activity in our primary markets the adverse effect of these events on the company may include narrowing of the spread between interest income and interest expense a reduction in fee income an increase in credit losses and a decrease in demand for loans and other products and services our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected by a health pandemic such as the covid19 pandemic or other health crisis a pandemic or other health crisis could destabilize the financial markets and the general economy forced shutdowns or regulations limiting business could have an adverse effect on our customers limiting their ability to satisfy obligations and limiting growth or demand for our loans and other services which could affect our liquidity financial condition and results of operations
