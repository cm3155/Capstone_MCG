item quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is a broad term for the risk of economic loss due to adverse changes in the fair value of a financial instrument these changes may be the result of various factors including interest rates foreign exchange rates commodity prices or equity prices financial instruments that are subject to market risk can be classified either as held for trading or held for purposes other than trading market risk excludes changes in fair value due to credit of the individual issuers of financial instruments bok financial is subject to market risk primarily through the effect of changes in interest rates on both its assets held for purposes other than trading and trading assets the effects of other changes such as foreign exchange rates commodity prices or equity prices do not pose significant market risk to bok financial bok financial has no material investments in assets that are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates or equity prices energy and agricultural product derivative contracts which are affected by changes in commodity prices are matched against offsetting contracts as previously discussed the assetliability committee is responsible for managing market risk in accordance with policy limits established by the board of directors the committee monitors projected variation in net interest revenue net income and economic value of equity due to specified changes in interest rates these limits also set maximum levels for shortterm borrowings shortterm assets public funds and brokered deposits and establish minimum levels for unpledged assets among other things further the board approved market risk limits for fixed income trading mortgage pipeline and mortgage servicing assets inclusive of economic hedge benefits exposure is measured daily and compliance is reviewed monthly deviations from the board approved limits which periodically occur throughout the reporting period may require management to develop and execute plans to reduce exposure these plans are subject to escalation to and approval by the board the simulations used to manage market risk are based on numerous assumptions regarding the effects of changes in interest rates on the timing and extent of repricing characteristics future cash flows and customer behavior these assumptions are inherently uncertain and as a result models cannot precisely estimate or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes market conditions and management strategies among other factors interest rate risk other than trading as previously noted in the net interest revenue section of this report management has implemented strategies to manage the companys balance sheet to have relatively limited exposure to changes in interest rates over a twelvemonth period the effectiveness of these strategies in managing the overall interest rate risk is evaluated through the use of an assetliability model bok financial performs a sensitivity analysis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures including embedded option positions on net interest revenue a simulation model is used to estimate the effect of changes in interest rates on our performance across multiple interest rate scenarios our current internal policy limit for net interest revenue variation due to a basis point parallel change in market interest rates over twelve months is a maximum decline of the results of a decrease in interest rates in the current lowrate environment are not meaningful the companys primary interest rate exposures include the federal funds rate which affects shortterm borrowings and the prime lending rate and libor which are the basis for much of the variable rate loan pricing additionally residential mortgage rates directly affect the prepayment speeds for residential mortgagebacked securities and mortgage servicing rights derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments used for purposes other than trading are included in this simulation in addition the impact on the level and composition of demand deposit accounts and other core deposit balances resulting from a significant increase in shortterm market interest rates and the overall interest rate environment is likely to be material the simulation incorporates assumptions regarding the effects of such changes based on a combination of historical analysis and expected behavior the impact of planned growth and new business activities is factored into the simulation model the interest rate sensitivity in table indicates managements estimation of the impact of rate changes on net interest revenue should deposit costs be more sensitive to changes in rates the variation in net interest revenue over the next twelve months would be or million for the basis point increase scenario alternatively should deposit funding costs be less sensitive to changes in rates the variation in net interest revenue over the next twelve months would be or million for the basis point increase scenario table interest rate sensitivity dollars in thousands table start bp increase bp increase anticipated impact over the next twelve months on net interest revenue anticipated impact over months twelve through twentyfour table end bok financial is also subjected to market risk through changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights are highly dependent on changes in primary mortgage rates offered to borrowers intermediateterm interest rates that affect the value of custodial funds and assumptions about servicing revenues servicing costs and discount rates as primary mortgage rates increase prepayment speeds slow and the value of our mortgage servicing rights increases as primary mortgage rates fall prepayment speeds increase and the value of our mortgage servicing rights decreases we maintain a portfolio of financial instruments which may include debt securities issued by the us government or its agencies and interest rate derivative contracts held as an economic hedge of the changes in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights composition of this portfolio will change based on our assessment of market risk changes in the fair value of residential mortgagebacked securities are highly dependent on changes in secondary mortgage rates required by investors and interest rate derivative contracts are highly dependent on changes in other market interest rates while primary and secondary mortgage rates generally move in the same direction the spread between them may widen and narrow due to market conditions and government intervention changes in the forwardlooking spread between the primary and secondary rates can cause significant earnings volatility management performs a stress test

residential mortgages held for sale rmhfs rmhfs are generally outstanding for to days which represents the typical period from commitment to originate a loan to sale of the closed loan to an investor primary mortgage interest rate changes during this period affect the value of rmhfs commitments and loans we use forward sale contracts to mitigate market risk on all closed mortgage loans held for sale and on an estimate of mortgage loan commitments that are expected to result in closed loans a variety of methods are used to monitor market risk of mortgage origination activities these methods include daily marking of all positions to market value independent verification of inventory pricing and revenue sensitivity limits management performs a stress test to measure market risk due to

as an intermediary for customers and for its own account as an intermediary we take positions in securities generally residential mortgagebacked securities government agency securities and municipal bonds these securities are purchased for resale to customers which include individuals corporations foundations and financial institutions on a limited basis we may also take trading positions in us treasury securities residential mortgagebacked securities and municipal bonds to enhance returns on securities portfolios both of these activities involve interest rate risk liquidity risk and price risk bok financial has an insignificant exposure to foreign exchange risk and does not take positions in commodity derivatives a variety of methods are used to monitor and manage the market risk of trading activities these methods include daily marking of all positions to market value independent verification of inventory pricing and position limits for each trading activity risk management tools include value at risk var stress testing and sensitivity analysis economic hedges in either the futures or cash markets may be used to reduce the risk associated with some trading programs basis risk can result when trading asset values and the instruments used to hedge them move at different rates var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon bok financial utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a 10day holding period and a confidence level presented in table below are var measures for both the three months ended december and september due to inherent limitations of the var methodology including its reliance on past market behavior which might not be indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing stressed var and sensitivity analysis stressed var is calculated using the same internal models as used for the varbased measure stressed var is calculated over a tenday holding period at a onetail confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelvemonth historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the companys trading portfolio the trading portfolios var and stressed var profiles are influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories table below summarizes certain var and stressed var based measures for the three months ended december and september in the fourth quarter of both var
