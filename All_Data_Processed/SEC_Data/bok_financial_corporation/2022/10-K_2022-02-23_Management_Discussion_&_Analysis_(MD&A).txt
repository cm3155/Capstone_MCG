discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report economic conditions across the us have continued to improve throughout following the initial year of the covid19 pandemic as of december the unemployment rate was down to a sharp decline from the levels experienced in in real gdp increased compared to in inflation continues to be well above the fomcs target of the federal reserve has kept the federal funds rate at or near zero throughout but has recently announced that increases may soon be appropriate in addition the fomc has decided to reduce the monthly pace of net asset purchases and bring them to an end in march see summary of credit loss experience section of managements discussion and analysis for additional discussion around our economic forecast performance summary net income for the year ended december totaled million or per diluted share compared with net income of million or per diluted share for the year ended december an improved outlook of economic conditions related to the covid19 pandemic and massive government stimulus drove a million reversal in of the million provision for credit losses recorded in preprovision net revenue ppnr a nongaap measure was million for compared to million in the prior year the decrease in ppnr was due to lower combined net interest revenue and fees and commission revenue this was largely driven by lower average loan balances due to customer deleveraging during current economic uncertainty narrowing net interest margin and compressed margins and production volumes from our mortgagebanking activities the decline was partially offset by gains recognized on the sales of an alternative investment and repossessed assets highlights of included net interest revenue totaled billion for consistent with the prior year net interest margin was for compared to for the full impact of the reduction of the federal funds rate by the federal reserve in was realized in the following reduction in other shortterm market interest rates reduced the yield on floatingrate assets by more than the amount by which funding costs could be reduced compressing the margin average earning assets were billion for up billion over largely due to increased trading securities fees and commissions revenue was million for a decrease of million compared to brokerage and trading revenues decreased million due to a shift from fee revenue to net interest revenue combined with narrowing margins mortgage banking revenue decreased million due to a decrease in mortgage production volume combined with a reduction in production revenue as a percentage of production volume other revenue increased million primarily due to higher production revenue on repossessed oil and gas properties which was largely offset by related operating expenses other gains net increased million to million due to sales of an alternative investment and

charitable donation to the bokf foundation increases in business promotion costs professional fees and other expenses were partially offset by lower personnel expense continued strength in commodity

expected credit losses in the fourth quarter of a million negative provision for expected credit losses was recorded in the third quarter of critical accounting policies estimates the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap the companys accounting policies are more fully described in note of the consolidated financial statements management makes significant assumptions and estimates in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with gaap that may be highly subjective complex and subject to variability actual results could differ significantly from these assumptions and estimates the following discussion addresses the most critical areas where these assumptions and estimates could affect the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from loan commitments the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments represent the portion of amortized cost basis of loans and related unfunded commitments we do not expect to collect over the assets contractual life considering past events current conditions as well as reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions appropriateness of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments is determined by a senior management allowance committee which requires judgment about effects of uncertain matters resulting in a subjective calculation which is inherently imprecise because of the subjective forwardlooking nature of the calculation changes in these measures may not directly correlate with actual economic events in future periods management judgment may consider new or changed information which may cause significant changes in these allowances in those future periods on january bok financials accounting policies changed significantly with the adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards update no financial instruments credit losses topic assets measured at amortized cost asu or cecl prior years were not restated prior to january general allowances and nonspecific allowances were based on incurred credit losses see note to the consolidated financial statements for the description of the expected credit losses calculation of the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk from unfunded loan commitments for the majority of riskgraded loans the accruing loans expected credit loss estimate is sensitive to management judgment particularly probability of default and loss given default assumptions changes in specific macroeconomic factor forecasts and the probability weight assigned to each economic scenario and appropriate adjustments significant assumptions and estimates affecting the allowance for loan losses and accrual for offbalance sheet credit risk include probability of default and loss given default measurements are based on historical data that may not be a good predictor of future performance or actual losses probability of default is based on risk grades a subjective measurement of the risk of a loan this subjective assessment of risk may not reflect actual risk of loss the forecast for each relevant economic loss driver and the probability weighting of economic scenarios are overseen by a senior management economic forecast committee which includes members independent of the allowance process the allowance committee may increase or decrease the allowance to reflect risks not captured in the quantitative component examples of circumstances that may result in adjustments include but are not limited to new lines of business market conditions that have not been previously encountered observed changes in credit risk that are not yet reflected in macroeconomic factors or economic conditions that impact loss given default assumptions although the resulting expected credit loss estimate represents managements best estimates at the time actual credit losses will differ from managements estimate portfolio composition will change over time actual economic conditions will differ from probabilityweighted assumptions borrowerspecific circumstances will change as well as other factors differences between actual losses and managements estimates may materially affect the companys results of operations we describe critical elements affecting our estimate of expected credit loss in the summary of credit loss experience section of managements discussion and analysis while it is challenging to evaluate the allowance impact for a change in a particular input results of such an analysis demonstrate how the quantitative element of the allowance behaves under different conditions the sensitivity to managements economic scenario weighting may be quantified by comparing the results of weighting each economic scenario at for example compared to a base case scenario a downside case would result in an additional million in quantitative reserve while a upside case would result in million less in quantitative reserve at december such sensitivity calculations do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the related allowance for a number of reasons including managements weighting of multiple forecasted economic scenarios in estimating expected credit losses managements predictions of future economic trends and relationships among the scenarios may differ from actual events and managements application of subjective measures to modeled results when appropriate fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are recorded at fair value in the consolidated financial statements fair value is defined by applicable accounting guidance as the price to sell an asset or transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants in the principal markets for the given asset or liability at the measurement date based on market conditions at that date an orderly transaction assumes exposure to the market for a customary period for marketing activities prior to the measurement date and not a forced liquidation or distressed sale a hierarchy for fair value has been established that prioritizes the inputs of valuation techniques used to measure fair value into three broad categories unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level other observable inputs that can be observed either directly or indirectly level and unobservable inputs for assets or liabilities level fair value may be recorded for certain assets and liabilities every reporting period on a recurring basis or under certain circumstances on a nonrecurring basis fair value measurements of significant assets or liabilities that are based on unobservable inputs level are considered critical accounting policies and estimates additional discussion of fair value measurement and disclosure is included in notes and of the consolidated financial statements mortgage servicing rights we have a significant investment in mortgage servicing rights our mortgage servicing rights are primarily retained from sales in the secondary market of residential mortgage loans we have originated or purchased from correspondent lenders occasionally mortgage servicing rights may be purchased from other lenders both originated and purchased mortgage servicing rights are initially recognized at fair value we carry all mortgage servicing rights at fair value changes in fair value are recognized in earnings as they occur mortgage servicing rights are not traded in active markets the fair value of mortgage servicing rights is determined by discounting the projected cash flows certain significant assumptions and estimates used in valuing mortgage servicing rights are based on current market sources including projected prepayment speeds assumed servicing costs earnings on escrow deposits ancillary income and discount rates assumptions used to value our mortgage servicing rights are considered significant unobservable inputs and represent our best estimate of assumptions that market participants would use to value this asset a separate third party model is used to estimate prepayment speeds based on interest rates housing turnover rates estimated loan curtailment anticipated defaults and other relevant factors the prepayment model is updated periodically for changes in market conditions and adjusted to better correlate with actual performance of our servicing portfolio the discount rate is based on benchmark rates for mortgage loans plus a market spread expected by investors in servicing rights significant assumptions used to determine the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements at least annually we request estimates of fair value from outside sources to corroborate the results of the valuation model the assumptions used in this model are primarily based on mortgage interest rates evaluation of the effect of a change in one assumption without considering the effect of that change on other assumptions is not meaningful considering all related assumptions we expect a basis point increase in primary mortgage interest rates to increase the fair value of our servicing rights by million we expect a million decrease in the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights from a basis point decrease in primary mortgage interest rates results of operations net interest revenue and net interest margin net interest revenue net interest revenue is the interest earned on debt securities loans and other interestearning assets less interest paid for interestbearing deposits and other borrowings the net interest margin is calculated by dividing taxequivalent net interest revenue by average interestearning assets net interest spread is the difference between the average rate earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest spread due to interest income earned on assets funded by noninterest bearing liabilities such as demand deposits and equity taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled billion for consistent with the prior year this includes million of ppp loan fees for and million for at december million of ppp loan fees remain to be recognized also included in was million of net purchase discount accretion compared to million in approximately million of purchase accounting discount remains to be accreted net interest revenue decreased million due to changes in interest rates and increased million from growth in earning assets table shows the effects on net interest revenue due to changes in average balances and interest rates for the various types of earning assets

largely due to an increase in our trading of us government agency residential mortgagebacked securities partially offset by a reduction in the loan portfolio average trading securities balances increased billion due to increased customer demand average loans net of allowance for loan losses decreased billion largely due to purposeful deleveraging by our customers as borrowers continue to pay down during this time of economic uncertainty the average balance of available for sale securities which consists largely of residential and commercial mortgagebacked securities guaranteed by us government agencies increased million fair value option securities that we hold as an economic hedge against changes in the fair value of mortgage servicing rights decreased million total average deposits grew by billion over the prior year this increase is largely due to customers retaining elevated balances in the current economic environment combined with government stimulusrelated deposits average interestbearing transaction account balances increased billion average demand deposit balances increased billion average shortterm borrowings decreased billion our overall objective is to manage the companys balance sheet for changes in interest rates as is further described in the market risk section of this report approximately of our commercial and commercial real estate loan portfolios are either variable rate loans or fixed rate loans that will reprice within one year these loans are funded primarily by deposit accounts that are either noninterest bearing or that reprice more slowly than the loans the result is a balance sheet that would be asset sensitive which means that assets generally reprice more quickly than liabilities among the strategies that we use to manage toward a relatively rateneutral position we purchase fixed rate residential mortgagebacked securities issued primarily by us government agencies and fund them with market rate sensitive liabilities the liabilitysensitive nature of this strategy provides an offset to the assetsensitive characteristics of our loan portfolio we also may use derivative instruments to manage our interest rate risk the effectiveness of these strategies is reflected in the overall change in net interest revenue due to changes in interest rates as shown in table and in the interest rate sensitivity projections as shown in the market risk section of this report fourth quarter net interest revenue taxequivalent net interest revenue totaled million for the fourth quarter of a decrease of million

markets commodity prices and consumer spending all of which can be volatile as an example of this strength many of the economic factors such as rising interest rates resulting in growth in net interest revenue or fiduciary and asset management revenue may also decrease mortgage banking production volumes and related trading we expect growth in other operating revenue to come through

banking and wealth management commercial banking includes lending treasury and cash management services and customer risk management products for small businesses middle market and larger commercial customers commercial banking also includes the transfund eft network consumer banking includes retail lending and deposit services lending and deposit services to small business customers served through our consumer branch network and all mortgage loan origination and servicing activities wealth management provides fiduciary services private bank services insurance and investment advisory services in all markets wealth management also underwrites state and municipal securities and engages in brokerage and trading activities in addition to our lines of business we have a funds management unit the primary purpose of this unit is to manage our overall liquidity needs and interest rate risk each line of business borrows funds from and provides funds to the funds management unit as needed to support their operations operating results for funds management and other include the effect of interest rate risk positions and risk management activities securities gains and losses including impairment charges the provision for credit losses in excess of net loans charged off tax planning strategies and certain executive compensation costs that are not attributed to the lines of business the funds management unit also initially recognizes accruals for loss contingencies when losses become probable actual losses are recognized by the lines of business if the accruals are settled we allocate resources and evaluate the performance of our lines of business using the net direct contribution which includes the allocation of funds and capital costs credit costs are attributed to the lines of business based on net loans charged off or recovered the difference between credit costs attributed to the lines of business and the consolidated provision for credit losses is attributed to funds management in addition we measure the performance of our business lines after allocations of certain indirect expenses and taxes based on statutory rates the cost of funds borrowed from the funds management unit by the operating lines of business is transfer priced at rates that approximate market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on the applicable wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates adjusted for prepayment risk and liquidity risk this method of transferpricing funds that support assets of the operating lines of business tends to insulate them from interest rate risk the value of funds provided by the operating lines of business to the funds management unit is also based on rates that approximate wholesale market rates for funds with similar repricing and cash flow characteristics market rates are generally based on a proxy of wholesale borrowing rates or interest rate swap rates the funds credit formula applied to deposit products with indeterminate maturities is established based on their repricing characteristics reflected in a combination of the shortterm wholesale funding rate and a moving average of an intermediate term swap rate with an appropriate spread applied to both shorter duration products are weighted towards the short term wholesale funding rates and longer duration products are weighted towards the intermediate swap rates the expected duration ranges from days for certain ratesensitive deposits to five years in order to appropriately reflect the organizational value of these deposits to the lines of business methodology adjustments are made each january that attribute more or less deposit credit value to the business lines dependent upon historical and forwardlooking interest rate expectations with the offset to funds management and other during shortterm rates moved down materially which was reflected in the funding credit to the business lines beginning in january those funding credits continued their downward trend in as a result of the sustained lowrate environment economic capital is assigned to the business units by a capital allocation model that reflects managements assessment of risk this model assigns capital based upon credit operating interest rate and other market risk inherent in our business lines and recognizes the diversification benefits among the units the level of assigned economic capital is a combination of the risk taken by each business line based on its actual exposures and calibrated to its own loss history where possible average invested capital includes economic capital and amounts we have invested in the lines of business as shown in table following net income

derivative programs create credit risk for potential amounts due to the company from our customers and from the counterparties customer credit risk is monitored through existing credit policies and
