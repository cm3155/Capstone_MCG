item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report in the following discussion unless otherwise noted references to increases or decreases in average balances in items of income and expense for a particular period and balances at a particular date refer to the comparison with corresponding amounts for the period or date for the previous year critical accounting policies we have established certain accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report certain of these policies require the use of judgments estimates and economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variation that may significantly affect our reported results of operations and financial position for the periods presented or in future periods management believes that the judgments estimates and economic assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses in accordance with asu the company adopted asc on january the allowance for credit losses under asc is an accounting estimate of expected losses over the contractual life of assets carried at amortized cost within the companys loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the asu requires a financial asset or group of financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset the quantitative allowance is calculated using a dcf approach with a probability of default methodology the probability of default is an assumption derived from regression models which determine the relationship between historical defaults and certain economic variables the company determines a reasonable and supportable forecast and applies that forecast to the model to determine defaults over the forecast period following the forecast period the economic variables used to calculate the probability of default revert to a historical average other assumptions relevant to the discounted cash flow model to derive the quantitative allowance include the loss given default which is the estimate of loss for a defaulted loan and the discount rate applied to future cash flows the model calculates the net present value of each loan using both the contractual and expected cash flows respectively the acl is determined at the end of each quarter and is based on all relevant information and expectations at that time in accordance with gaap and the acl guidance future changes to the estimate are likely as new information becomes available regarding economic conditions loan composition and identifiable risk factors while quantifiable estimates are generated management judgements regarding credit risks and the inherent imprecision with the models utilized support the overall acl in addition to the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the effects of the following qualitative factors in its calculation of expected losses in the loan portfolio economic and business conditions concentration of credit lending management and staff lending policies and procedures loss and recovery trends nature and volume of the portfolio trends in problem loans loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans quality of internal loan review and other external factors such as the effect of economic stimulus and loan modification programs these qualitative factors are based in quantitative factors but also include a high degree of subjectivity and changes in any of the factors could have a significant impact on our calculation of the allowance loans for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral are considered collateraldependent the allowance for credit losses for collateraldependent loans is measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral when foreclosure is probable table of contents our allowance policy and the judgments estimates and economic assumptions involved are described in greater detail in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments and letters of credit section of this discussion and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report business combinations the company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price a bargain purchase gain is recognized acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred valuation and recoverability of goodwill goodwill represented million of our billion in total assets as of december the company has a single reporting unit we review goodwill for impairment annually as of july 31st and also test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount such events and circumstances may include among others a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements under the intangiblesgoodwill and other topic of the fasb asc goodwill is not amortized but rather is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis asu intangibles goodwill and other topic simplifying the test for goodwill impairment was issued in january and was effective january reduced the cost and complexity of goodwill impairment testing this asu eliminated the second step of the goodwill impairment test the test for impairment requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value the difference is the amount of impairment and goodwill is written down to the fair value of the reporting unit prior to the issuance of asu the second step of the impairment process was to compare the implied fair value of goodwill with its carrying value prior to completing the impairment test however the company may assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if such an assessment indicates the fair value of the reporting unit is more likely than not greater than its carrying value then the impairment test need not be completed the accounting estimates related to our goodwill require us to make considerable assumptions about fair value our assumptions regarding fair value require significant judgment about economic and industry factors and the growth and earnings prospects of the bank changes in these judgments either individually or collectively may have a significant effect on the estimated fair value based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test we determined that no goodwill impairment charges were required as our single reporting units fair value exceeded its carrying amount as of december we determined there were no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item

loans have potential weaknesses that if left uncorrected may result in deterioration of the repayment prospects for the asset or in the companys credit position at some future date loans with a risk rating of substandard or worse are reviewed to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and as a result the risk rating or accrual status may be adjusted

ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets tier to riskweighted assets or total capital to riskweighted assets above the minimum but below the capital conservation buffer will face constraints on dividends equity repurchases and compensation based on the amount of the shortfall the company and the bank are required to maintain such additional capital conservation buffer of of cet1 effectively resulting in minimum ratios of i cet1 to riskweighted assets of at least ii tier capital to riskweighted assets of at least and iii total capital to riskweighted assets of at least the company and the bank met all such capital requirements as of december in addition fdic regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as wellcapitalized as discussed in item businesssupervision

february to shareholders of record at the close of business on february applicable federal and washington state regulations restrict capital distributions including dividends by the companys banking subsidiary such restrictions are tied to the institutions capital levels after giving effect to distributions our ability to pay cash dividends is substantially dependent upon receipt of dividends

and average common equity to average assets ratios for all reported periods nongaap financial measures in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets the company believes these measures are useful because they reflect the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these measures allows readers to compare certain aspects of the companys capitalization to other organizations these ratios differ from capital measures defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes shareholders equity associated with preferred securities the nature and extent of which varies across organizations additionally these measures present capital adequacy inclusive and exclusive of accumulated other comprehensive income these calculations are intended to complement the capital ratios defined by banking regulators for both absolute and comparative purposes because gaap in the united states of america does not include capital ratio measures the company believes there are no comparable gaap financial measures to these tangible common equity ratios the following table reconciles the companys calculation of these measures to amounts reported under gaap table of contents despite the importance of these measures to the company there are no standardized definitions for them and as a result the companys
