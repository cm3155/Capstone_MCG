periods financial performance comparison of current quarter to prior quarter earnings per diluted common share was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended december the increase for the three months ended march as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by a million decrease in the provision for credit losses as well as a decrease in noninterest expense largely due to the prior quarter including million for the fdic special assessment this favorable change was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest income driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and net interest income net interest income decreased due to higher deposit costs relative to the fourth quarter and lower income earned on investment securities given slower prepayment activity net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended december the decrease for the three months ended march was due to the effect of deposit repricing and balance mix shift during the quarter noninterest income was million for the three months ended march as compared to million for the three months ended december the decline was driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of million in the first quarter compared to a net fair value gain of million in the fourth quarter noninterest expense was million for the three months ended march as compared to million for the three months ended december the

the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended march the increase for the three months ended march as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses due to the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans that was recorded in the first quarter of noninterest expense also decreased primarily due to lower mergerrelated expenses and net interest income increased primarily due to a full quarter operating as a combined company compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended march the decrease for the three months ended march compared to the prior year

were impacted by the full quarter as a combined company compared to only one month as a combined company for the prior year period table of contents noninterest expense was million for the three months ended march as compared to million for the three months ended march the decrease for the three months ended march reflects a decrease in mergerrelated expenses of million partially offset by

month as a combined company for the prior year period comparison of current period end to prior year end total loans and leases were billion as of march an increase of million as compared to december the increase in total loans and leases was primarily in the commercial real estate and commercial loan balances and was driven primarily by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the quarter higher commercial real estate term balances reflect projects that transitioned from construction to permanent financing total deposits were billion as of march an increase of million as compared to december the increase was due to growth in money market accounts time deposits and interestbearing demand deposits partially offset by a decline in noninterestbearing demand

as of december nonperforming loans and leases were million or of total loans and leases as of march compared to million or of total loans and leases as of december the increase in nonperforming assets during the quarter was driven primarily by migration in our sba portfolio and an owneroccupied commercial real estate property the allowance for credit losses was million as of march a decrease of million compared to december the decrease in the allowance for credit losses was due to changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our cecl calculation for

credit losses of million for the three months ended december and million for the three months ended march the decrease for the three months ended march compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to

critical accounting estimates our critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the critical accounting estimates section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december filed with the sec on february the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported management believes that the estimates for acl business combinations and goodwill are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and require difficult subjective or complex judgments there have been no material changes in the methodology of these estimates during the three months ended march results of operations columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february the merger date reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis accordingly columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect only uhc financial results through the closing of the merger as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the first quarter of may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had net income of million for the three months ended march compared to net income of million for the three months ended december the increase in net income is mainly attributable to a decrease in noninterest expense and a decrease in provision for credit losses partially offset by decreases in net interest income and noninterest income the decrease of million in noninterest expense is mainly due to a decrease in fdic assessments as a result of the fdic special assessment of million in the fourth quarter of as well as decreases in all categories as a result of lower discretionary spending and other expense items compared to expense items in the fourth quarter the company conducted an enterprisewide evaluation of our operations during the first quarter of which resulted in consolidated positions simplified reporting and organizational structures the changes are expected to be carried out in the second and third quarters of to achieve a core expense run rate for the fourth quarter of of million to million annualized the expected core expense run rate excludes cdi amortization mergerrelated expenses exit and disposal costs and the fdic special assessment the decrease of million in provision for credit losses reflects changes in the economic assumptions used in credit models and a recalibration of our cecl calculation for nonhomogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans the decrease of million in net interest income is due to higher interest expense driven by higher average rates and balances in interestbearing liabilities in addition to a decrease in interest income largely driven by lower income earned on investment securities given slower prepayment activity the company is actively managing and selectively reducing deposit offered rates the decrease of million in noninterest income was primarily driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the three months ended march the company had net income of million compared to net loss of million for the same period in the prior year the increase in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in net interest income a decrease in provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest expense the increase of million in net interest income was due to higher loan interest income from increasing rates and higher average loan and lease balances as well as the impact of purchase accounting accretion and amortization these increases were partially offset by higher funding costs the decrease of million in provision for credit losses was driven primarily by the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans that was recorded in the first quarter of the decrease of million in noninterest expense was due to a decrease in mergerrelated expenses of million partially offset by increases in amortization of intangible assets of million and salaries and employee benefits of million which were impacted by the full quarter

average common shareholders equity gaap and average tangible common shareholders equity nongaap for the periods indicated for each period presented the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity this measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization tangible common equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be viewed in conjunction with the return on average

assets return on average common shareholders equity return on average tangible common shareholders equity calculation of average common tangible shareholders equity average common shareholders equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net average tangible common shareholders equity additionally management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered nongaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equity and the total shareholders equity ratio table of contents the following table provides a

december total shareholders equity subtract goodwill other intangible assets net tangible common shareholders equity total assets subtract goodwill other intangible assets net tangible assets total shareholders equity to total assets ratio tangible common equity ratio nongaap financial measures have inherent limitations are not required to be uniformly applied and are not reviewed or audited although we believe these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap net interest income comparison of current quarter to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended march was million a decrease of million compared to the three months ended december the decrease was driven by a million increase in interest expense due to higher average rates and balances in interestbearing liabilities in addition to a million decrease in interest income largely driven by lower income earned on investment securities given slower prepayment activity the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended december the contraction in net interest margin was driven by higher average deposit costs which increased at an accelerated pace through the fourth quarter and into january before stabilizing in the latter part of the first quarter the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended march remained flat compared to the three months ended december the cost of interestbearing liabilities for the three months ended march increased by basis points compared to the three months ended december due to rising rates and product mix shift to higher cost money market and time deposits this was partially offset by a lower cost for borrowings as the company was able to utilize the more favorable rates associated with the frb btfp comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period net interest income for the three months ended march was million an increase of million compared to the three months ended march the increase reflects a larger average balance sheet for the three months ended march compared to the prior year period as a result of the merger in addition to higher average yields on interestearning assets partially offset by higher rates on interestbearing liabilities table of contents the net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended march as compared to for the three months ended march the decrease for the three months ended march compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs deposit repricing and a shift in product mix the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended march increased by basis points as compared to the same period in primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities increased by basis points for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due to a higher mix of highercost time deposits and term borrowings as well as rising interest rates our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in the yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds the federal reserve increased the target range for the federal funds rate by between march and july which marked the most recent increase to the federal funds rate during that period our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the federal reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing since the federal reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate we have experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaces the increase in our earning asset yields as our deposits have continued to reprice higher and our funding base has experienced a shift toward highercost sources as federal reserve actions have reduced available liquidity within the banking industry as a result our net interest margin has contracted since july due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets table of contents the following table

leases the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended march was as compared to for the three months ended december the change in provision for credit losses reflects changes in the economic assumptions and recalibration of our cecl calculation for nonhomogeneous commercial loans and leases and residential development loans during the first quarter we recalibrated the commercial cecl model to be more reflective of the postmerger loan portfolio after a full year operating as a combined organization we believe the recalibrated model is more reflective of the quality

loans in a nonaccrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or chargedoff however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases

value adjustments including the fair value loss on equity securities are inversely influenced by the change in longer term interest rates comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period other income for the three months ended march decreased as compared to the three months ended march primarily due to interest rate fluctuations resulting in a loss on the fair value of certain loans held

higher commercial real estate term balances reflect projects that transitioned from construction to permanent financing delinquency and nonaccrual loan movements during the quarter reflect an anticipated move toward a normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptional high credit quality the increase in nonperforming assets during the quarter was driven primarily by

properties located in suburban markets secure the majority of our office portfolio as only of nonowner occupied loans are located in downtown core business districts loans secured by multifamily properties including construction represent approximately of the total loan portfolio these assets continue to perform well due to demand for rental properties in our geographic footprint although management believes such concentrations have no more than the normal risk of collectability a substantial decline in the economy in general material increases in interest rates changes in tax policies tightening credit or refinancing markets or a decline in real estate values in the banks primary geographic footprint in particular could have an adverse impact on the repayment of these loans the

forecast which shows a worsening economic situation from the forecast used in the prior quarter refer to note allowance for credit losses for further information on key components of the forecast the models for calculating the acl are sensitive to changes to economic variables which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time we believe that the acl as of march is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information available if the economic conditions decline the bank may need additional provisions for credit losses in future periods residential mortgage servicing rights the following table presents the changes in our residential msr portfolio for the periods indicated

over a period of years using the sumoftheyearsdigits method intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment no impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented deposits total deposits were billion as of march an increase of million as compared to december the increase was due to growth in money market time deposits and interestbearing demand accounts partially offset by a decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits the interestbearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from noninterestbearing to interestbearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment the following table presents the deposit balances by category as of the dates presented march december

of march the bank had outstanding securities sold under agreements to repurchase of million a decrease of million from december the bank had outstanding borrowings consisting of advances from the fhlb and frb of billion as of march and billion as of december the decrease compared to the fourth quarter of was primarily due to repayment of higher priced borrowings as well as general liquidity management fhlb advances have fixed rates ranging from to with the majority set to mature before the end of the first quarter of advances from the fhlb are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate the frb borrowings have interest rates ranging from to and mature within one year of march although the company has the ability to repay balances prior to maturity without penalty the frb borrowings are secured by investment securities junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million as of march and december respectively the decrease is mainly due to a decrease of million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value the change in fair value was due to an increase in the credit spread and spot curve partially offset by an increase in the implied forward curve as of march substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth term sofr liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity to support growth of deposit balances fund growth in lending and investment portfolios and deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources we monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented of total deposits at march and december the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank the companys diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the companys reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion as of march compared with billion at december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase issue brokered certificates of deposit or utilize offbalance sheet funding sources table of contents the bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of offbalance sheet funding sources these liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit advances from the fhlb and the federal reserve banks discount window availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds

limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company fdic and oregon division of financial regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the bank to the company although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels commitments and other contractual obligations the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as of march time deposits totaled billion of which billion

net income of million during the period the companys dividend policy considers among other things earnings regulatory capital levels the overall payout ratio and expected asset growth to determine the amount of dividends declared if any on a quarterly basis there is no assurance that future cash dividends on common shares will be declared or increased we cannot predict the extent of the economic decline that could result in inadequate earnings regulatory restrictions and limitations changes to our capital requirements or a decision to increase capital by retention of earnings that may result in the inability to pay dividends at previous levels or at all on february columbia declared a cash dividend in the amount of per common share based on fourth quarter performance which was paid on
