the entity in addition these regulators must establish regulations or guidelines requiring enhanced disclosure to regulators of incentivebased compensation arrangements in june the federal reserve and fdic issued comprehensive final guidance on incentive compensation policies intended to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations do not undermine the safety and soundness of such organizations by encouraging excessive risktaking the guidance which covers all employees that have the ability to materially affect the risk profile of an organization either individually or as part of a group is based upon the key principles that a banking organizations incentive compensation arrangements should i provide incentives that appropriately balance risk and financial results in a manner that does not encourage employees to expose their organizations to imprudent risk ii be compatible with effective internal controls and risk management and iii be supported by strong corporate governance including active and effective oversight by the organizations board of directors during the second quarter of the us financial regulators including the federal reserve and the sec proposed revised rules on incentivebased payment arrangements at specified regulated entities having at least billion in total assets but these proposed rules have not been finalized the federal reserve will review as part of the regular riskfocused examination process the incentive compensation arrangements of banking organizations such as us that are not large complex banking organizations these reviews will be tailored to each organization based on the scope and complexity of the organizations activities and the prevalence of incentive compensation arrangements the findings of the supervisory initiatives will be included in reports of examination deficiencies will be incorporated into the organizations supervisory ratings which can affect the organizations ability to make acquisitions and take other actions enforcement actions may be taken against a banking organization if its incentive compensation arrangements or related risk management control or governance processes pose a risk to the organizations safety and soundness and the organization is not taking prompt and effective measures to correct the deficiencies in october nasdaq adopted a rule as required by the secs rulemaking that requires listed companies to adopt policies mandating the recovery or clawback of excess incentivebased compensation earned by a current or former executive officer during the three fiscal years preceding a required accounting restatement including to correct an error that would result in a material misstatement if the error were corrected in the current period or left uncorrected in the current period the excess compensation would be based on the amount the executive officer would have received had the incentivebased compensation been determined using the restated financials effective as of december columbia adopted a clawback policy in accordance with nasdaqs listing standards proposed legislation proposed legislation relating to the banking industry is introduced in almost every legislative session certain of such legislation could dramatically affect the regulation of the banking industry we cannot predict if any such legislation will be adopted or if it is adopted how it would affect the business of umpqua bank or the company recent history has demonstrated that new legislation or changes to existing laws or regulations usually results in a greater compliance burden and therefore generally increases the cost of doing business effects of government monetary policy our earnings and growth are affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the fiscal and monetary policies of the federal government particularly the federal reserve the federal reserve implements national monetary policy for such purposes as curbing inflation and combating recession but its open market operations in us government securities control of the discount rate applicable to borrowings from the federal reserve and establishment of reserve requirements against certain deposits influence the growth of bank loans investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans or paid on deposits the nature and impact of future changes in monetary policies and their impact on us cannot be predicted with certainty
