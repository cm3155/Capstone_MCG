item risk factors the following is a discussion of what we currently believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition and future results risks relating to our operations a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or those of our third party service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our business result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses as a financial institution our operations rely heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system customer relationship management general ledger deposit and loan servicing and other systems the security and integrity of our systems are susceptible to a variety of interruptions or information security breaches including those caused by computer hacking cyberattacks electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets we are not able to anticipate detect or implement effective preventative measures against all threats particularly because the techniques used by cybercriminals change frequently often are not recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately address all such failures interruptions or security breaches that may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects while we have certain protective policies and procedures in place the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues additionally we face the risk of operational disruption failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities including exchanges clearing agents clearing houses or other financial intermediaries such parties can also be the source of an attack on or breach of our operational systems failures interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business result in a violation of privacy or other laws or expose us to civil litigation regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects further as an investigation into a cyberattack is inherently unpredictable it may take a significant amount of time for us to fully uncover the scope of and damage related to a cyberattack and develop an effective mitigation plan during such time damage related to a cyberattack may continue and communications to the public customers regulators and other stakeholders may not be timely or accurate potential new regulations may require us to publicly disclose information about a cyberattack before the incident has been resolved or fully investigated the confidential information of our customers including user names and passwords can also be jeopardized from the compromise of customers personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses subject us to various risks and may not result in all of the benefits anticipated future acquisitions may be dilutive to current shareholders and future acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues we have in the past sought and expect in the future to continue to seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses as of the date of this report our proposed combination with umpqua is pending consummation risks specifically associated with this pending merger can be found below under the heading risks relating to our pending merger with umpqua our acquisitions including our recently completed acquisition of bank of commerce may not have the anticipated positive results including results relating to correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets being acquired the total cost of integration including management attention and resources the time required to complete the integration successfully the amount of longerterm cost savings being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition or the overall performance of the combined entity in addition unexpected contingent liabilities can arise from the businesses we acquire integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems financial reporting and management and internal controls as well as managing relevant relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect these systems processes or controls and our operations or results table of contents acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business we may engage in additional future acquisitions involving the issuance of additional common stock andor cash any such acquisitions and related issuances of stock may have a dilutive effect on eps book value per share or the percentage ownership of current shareholders the use of cash as consideration in any such acquisitions could impact our capital position and may require us to raise additional capital furthermore notwithstanding our prior acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to the extent to which we can continue to grow through acquisitions as this will depend on the availability of prospective target opportunities at valuations we find attractive and other factors among other things acquisitions by financial institutions are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have or may have with regulatory agencies in addition the northwest is experiencing intensified consolidation in the banking industry and we face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions for attractive acquisition candidates and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations have been and may in the future be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected and may in the future adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will negatively affect our business financial condition liquidity and results of operations will depend on future developments including the emergence of new variants of covid19 and the widespread availability use and effectiveness of vaccines over the long term and against new variants which are highly uncertain and cannot be predicted while financial markets rebounded from the significant declines that occurred earlier in the pandemic and global economic conditions showed signs of improvement during the second half of and in many of the circumstances that arose or became more pronounced after the onset of the covid19 pandemic persisted through the beginning of including i muted levels of business activity across many sectors of the economy weakened consumer confidence and disruptions to the global supply chain ii elevated levels of market volatility iii the federal funds rate and yields on us treasury securities near zero iv the exacerbation of recent inflationary trends v heightened credit risk with regard to industries that have been most severely impacted by the pandemic and vi higher cybersecurity information security and operational risks as a result of workfromhome arrangements depending on the duration and severity of the covid19 pandemic going forward as well as the effects of the pandemic on consumer and corporate confidence the conditions noted above could continue for an extended period and other adverse developments may occur or reoccur governmental authorities worldwide have taken increased measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth the continued success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address future market dislocations or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity and certain authorities have indicated an intention or are under pressure to wind down certain of these measures to counter inflationary trends we also face an increased risk of client disputes litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on economic and market conditions the length of the pandemic and the efficacy of the extraordinary measures that have been put in place to address it are unknown for example the omicron variant of covid19 has led to a spike in covid19 cases across the united states has led to travel and other disruptions and certain governmental authorities and other third parties have reimposed restrictions in order to respond to the rise in cases attributable to the omicron variant of covid19 the us economy as well as most other major economies may continue to experience a recession and we anticipate our businesses would be materially and adversely affected by a prolonged recession in the us and other major markets further the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in this risk factors section or in the risk factors section of any subsequent quarterly report we file on fees and other regulatory fees financial printing and other printing costs closing integration and other related costs some of these costs are payable by columbia regardless of whether or not the merger is completed the merger agreement between the company and umpqua may be terminated in accordance with its terms and the merger may not be completed the merger agreement is subject to a number of conditions which must be fulfilled in order to complete the merger those conditions include among other things i approval by each of the columbia shareholders and the umpqua shareholders of certain matters relating to the merger at each companys respective special meeting which approvals were obtained on january ii the receipt of required regulatory approvals including the approval of the frb and the fdic which approvals were obtained on october and january respectively and iii the absence of any order injunction decree or other legal restraint preventing the completion of the merger the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement or making the completion of the merger the bank merger or any of the other transactions contemplated by the merger agreement illegal each partys obligation to complete the merger is also subject to certain additional customary conditions including a subject to applicable materiality standards the accuracy of the representations and warranties of the other party set forth in the merger agreement b the performance in all material respects by the other party of its obligations under the merger agreement and c the receipt by each party of an opinion from its counsel to the effect that the merger will qualify as a reorganization within the meaning of section 368a of the internal revenue code of these conditions to the closing may not be fulfilled in a timely manner or at all and accordingly the merger may not be completed in addition the parties can mutually decide to terminate the merger agreement at any time before or after the requisite shareholder approvals or umpqua or columbia may elect to terminate the merger agreement in certain other circumstances our assumptions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans if our assumptions are incorrect significant earnings volatility can occur and credit loss provisions may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio any increase in future loan losses could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects if the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders equity accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under acquisition accounting if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets the excess is carried on the acquirers balance sheet as goodwill in accordance with gaap our goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists such evaluation may be based on a variety of factors including the quoted price of our common stock market prices of common stock of other banking organizations common stock trading multiples dcf analysis and data from comparable acquisitions future evaluations of goodwill may result in impairment and ensuing writedowns which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders equity table of contents we may not be able to attract or retain key employees our success depends in significant part on the skills of our management team and our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees we expect our future success to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with our clients by our executives and other key employees leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations or other departures will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase the increase in remote and hybrid work arrangements has also increased competition for skilled personnel and our current or future approach to inoffice or remotework arrangements may not meet the needs or expectations of current or prospective employees or may not be perceived as favorable compared to arrangements offered by other companies which could adversely affect our ability to attract and retain skilled and qualified personnel we need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business the unexpected loss of any such employees or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the scope and content of us banking regulators regulations and policies on incentive compensation as well as changes to these regulations and policies could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate our key employees our ability to sustain or improve upon existing performance is dependent upon our ability to respond to technological change and we may have fewer resources than some of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers in addition the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with our increased dependency on technology significant legal or regulatory actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities and reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations claims and legal actions including supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities could involve large monetary claims including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and significant defense costs if the proposed merger with umpqua is completed the combined company will also be subject to the claims and proceedings related to umpquas operations to mitigate the cost of some of these claims we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations however our insurance coverage does not cover any civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and may not cover all other claims that might be brought against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost as a result we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities which could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could cause significant reputational harm to us andor could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects because we primarily serve individuals and businesses located in the northwest any negative impact resulting from reputational harm including any impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees likely would be greater than if our business were more geographically diverse we are subject to a variety of operational risks including reputational risk legal and compliance risk and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders which may adversely affect our business and results of operations we are exposed to many types of operational risks including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems these risks have increased in light of workfromhome arrangements implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic table of contents our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel whether or not accurate or true that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels in particular social media may magnify risks relating to negative publicity if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect we are also subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets that can give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate the occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business for example by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention each of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we face reputation and business risks due to our interactions with business partners service providers and other third parties we rely on third parties to provide services to us and our clients or otherwise act as partners in our business activities in a variety of ways including through the provision of key components of our business infrastructure we expect these third parties to perform services for us fulfill their obligations to us accurately inform us of relevant information and conduct their activities in a manner that reflects positively on our brand and business although we manage exposure to such thirdparty risk through a variety of means including the performance of due diligence and ongoing monitoring of vendor performance there can be no assurance these efforts will be effective any failure of our business partners service providers or other third parties to meet their commitments to us or to perform in accordance with our expectations could result in operational disruptions increased expenditures regulatory actions in which we may be held responsible for the actions of third parties damage to our reputation and the loss of clients which in turn could harm our business and operations strategic growth objectives and financial performance because of the covid19 pandemic many of our counterparties and thirdparty service providers have been and may further be affected by the continuing shift to workfromhome or hybridwork arrangements market volatility and other factors that increase their risk of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services our thirdparty partners may also rely on their own business partners and service providers in the ordinary course of their business although we seek to diversify our exposure to thirdparty partners in order to increase our resiliency we are nevertheless exposed to the risk that a disruption or other information technology event at a common service provider to our vendors could impede their ability to provide products or services to us which in turn could harm our business and operations strategic growth objectives and financial performance failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may adversely affect our business and results of operations management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks any system of controls and procedures however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls are not insured against or are in excess of our insurance limits any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents interest rate and credit risks economic conditions in the market areas we serve may adversely impact our earnings and could increase our credit risk associated with our loan portfolio the value of our investment portfolio and the availability of deposits substantially all of our loan and deposit customers are businesses and individuals in washington oregon idaho and california and soft economies in these market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects a deterioration in the market areas we serve could result in consequences including the following any of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects loan delinquencies may increase problem assets and foreclosures may increase collateral for loans made may decline in value in turn reducing customers borrowing power reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans certain securities within our investment portfolio could require an allowance for credit losses requiring a writedown through earnings to fair value thereby reducing equity lowcost or noninterestbearing deposits may decrease and demand for our loan and other products and services may decrease concentrations within our loan portfolio could result in increased credit risk in a challenging economy while our loan portfolio is diversified across business sectors it is concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans these types of loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments in fact the fdic has issued pronouncements alerting banks of its concern about heavy loan concentrations commercial real estate valuations can be significantly affected over relatively short periods of time by changes in business climate economic conditions interest rates and in many cases the results of operations of businesses and other occupants of the real property emerging and evolving factors such as the shift to workfromhome or hybridwork arrangements changing consumer preferences including online shopping covid19related restrictions and resulting changes in occupancy rates as a result of these and other trends can also impact such valuations over relatively short periods because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate and commercial business loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan losses or an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects a large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate deterioration in the real estate market or other segments of our loan portfolio would lead to additional losses as of december of our total gross loans were secured by real estate any renewed downturn in the economies or real estate values in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on both borrowers ability to repay their loans and the value of the real property securing such loans our ability to recover on defaulted loans would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans any or all of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our allowance may not be adequate to cover future loan losses which could adversely affect earnings we maintain an allowance for credit losses for periods prior to january referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to provide for losses inherent in our loan portfolio while we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming at any time there are loans in the portfolio that could result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified additionally the process for determining the allowance requires different subjective and complex judgments about the future impact from current economic conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans as a result future significant increases to the allowance may be necessary future increases to the allowance may be required based on changes in the composition of the loans comprising the portfolio deteriorating values in underlying collateral most of which consists of real estate and changes in the financial condition of borrowers such as may result from changes in economic conditions or as a result of actual future events differing from assumptions used by management in determining the allowance table of contents additionally banking regulators as an integral part of their supervisory function periodically review our allowance these regulatory agencies may require us to increase the allowance any increase in the allowance would have an adverse effect which could be material on our financial condition and results of operations nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans thereby adversely affecting our income moreover nonaccrual loans increase our loan administration costs assets acquired by foreclosure or similar proceedings are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell the valuation of these foreclosed assets is periodically updated and resulting losses if any are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified an increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks we utilize various techniques such as loan sales workouts and restructurings to manage our problem assets decreases in the value of these problem assets the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial condition would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff which can be detrimental to performance of their other responsibilities we may experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our business significant increases in market interest rates on loans or the perception that an increase may occur could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow conversely decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments an increase in market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floatingrate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations if this occurred it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and chargeoffs which could adversely affect our business further our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income which is the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans securities and other interestearning assets and the interest paid on deposits borrowings and other interestbearing liabilities because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities accordingly fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and in turn our profitability the federal reserve raised benchmark interest rates throughout and may continue to raise interest rates in response to economic conditions particularly inflationary pressures increases in interest rates to combat inflation or otherwise may result in a change in the mix of noninterest and interestbearing accounts and may have otherwise have unpredictable effects for example increases in interest rates may result in increases in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults by clients and more nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs decreases in deposit levels decreases to the demand for interest ratebased products and services including loans and changes to the level of offbalance sheet marketbased investments preferred by our clients each of which may reduce our interest rate spread lower rates would continue to constrain our interest rate spread and adversely affect our business forecasts we are unable to predict changes in interest rates which are affected by factors beyond our control including inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other changes in financial markets interest rates on certain of our outstanding financial instruments are subject to change based on regulatory developments which could adversely affect our revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments libor and certain other benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted the united kingdoms financial conduct authority and the benchmark administrator for the us dollar libor have announced that the publication of the most commonly used us dollar libor settings will cease to be provided or cease to be representative after june in march the us dollar adjustable interest rate libor act the libor act was enacted providing a uniform approach for replacing libor as a reference interest rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in socalled tough legacy contracts tough legacy contracts are contracts that do not include effective fallback provisions for example because they have no provisions for a replacement benchmark under the libor act references to the most common tenors of libor in these contracts will be replaced automatically to reference a sofrbased benchmark interest rate identified in federal reserve regulations in december the federal reserve issued final regulations identifying benchmark replacements based on sofr for various types of contracts subject to the libor act we may be adversely impacted by the changes involving libor and other benchmark rates as a result of our business activities and our underlying operations and interest rates on our loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments may be adversely affected table of contents there continues to be substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate effects of libor transition including with respect to the acceptance and use of sofr or other alternative benchmark rates the characteristics of these new rates are not identical to the benchmarks they seek to replace will not produce the exact economic equivalent as those benchmarks and may perform differently in a variety of market conditions compared to those benchmarks for example during the covid19 pandemic period there has been more volatility in relation to sofr as compared to libor the sofr markets have not yet developed into robust markets which may present continuing risks as the june libor cessation date approaches at this time it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments our business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk the operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk as a lender we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans if any may not be sufficient to ensure repayment in addition there are risks inherent in making any loan including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers in order to successfully manage credit risk we must among other things maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our bankers follow those standards the weakening of these standards for any reason such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio may result in loan defaults foreclosures and additional chargeoffs and may necessitate that we increase our acl each of which could adversely affect our net income as a result our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we may be required in the future to recognize a credit loss with respect to investment securities our securities portfolio currently includes securities with unrecognized losses as of december gross unrealized losses in our securities portfolio were million we may continue to observe declines in the fair market value of these securities securities issued by certain states and municipalities may come under scrutiny due to concerns about credit quality although management believes the credit quality of the companys state and municipal securities portfolio to be good there can be no assurance that the credit quality of these securities will not decline in the future we evaluate the securities portfolio for any securities with an associated credit loss each reporting period as required by gaap in the united states there can be no assurance however that future evaluations of the securities portfolio will not require us to recognize credit losses with respect to these and other holdings for example it is possible that governmentsponsored programs to allow mortgages to be refinanced to lower rates could materially adversely impact the yield on our portfolio of mortgagebacked securities since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is composed of such securities we are exposed to the risk of environmental liabilities in connection with real properties acquired during the ordinary course of business we foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if previously unknown or undisclosed hazardous or toxic substances are discovered we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses which may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement polices with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures which require the performance of an environmental review at the time of underwriting a loan secured by real property and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations funding and liquidity risks our management of capital could adversely affect profitability measures and the market price of our common stock and could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock our capital ratios are higher than regulatory minimums we may lower our capital ratios through selective acquisitions that meet our disciplined criteria share repurchase plans organic loan growth investment in securities or a combination of all four we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our business through strategic acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate future acquisitions on terms acceptable to us table of contents conversely there may be circumstances under which it would be prudent to consider alternatives for raising capital to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities or in response to changing economic conditions in addition we may need to raise additional capital in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly we may not be able to raise additional capital when needed on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at the time which are outside our control and our financial performance further if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition any capital raising alternatives could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock conditions in the financial markets may limit access to additional funding to meet liquidity needs we may need or want to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly our ability to raise additional capital will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside of our control and our financial performance economic conditions and any loss of confidence in financial institutions generally may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital there can be no assurance that capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets such as a decline in the confidence of equity or debt purchasers or counterparties participating in capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and potentially our liquidity also if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations legal accounting and compliance risks we operate in a highly regulated environment and changes to or increases in or supervisory enforcement of banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us we are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities in addition as a publiclytraded company we are subject to regulation by the sec any change in applicable regulations or federal state or local legislation or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement income tax laws or accounting principles could have a substantial impact on us and our operations changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on our operations additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects failure to appropriately comply with any such laws regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or damage to our reputation all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations for example the doddfrank act was enacted in july among other provisions the legislation i created the cfpb with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages ii resulted in new capital requirements from federal

also experience competition especially for deposits from internetbased banking institutions which have grown rapidly in recent years we are subject to substantial competition for loans and deposits from other financial institutions some of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restriction as we are andor have greater financial resources than we do some of our

behaviors and business preferences may affect whether and on what terms and conditions we will table of contents engage in certain activities or offer certain products or services the governmental and supervisory focus on climate change could also result in our becoming subject to new or heightened regulatory requirements relating to climate change such as requirements relating to operational resiliency or stress testing for various climate stress scenarios any such new or heightened requirements could result in increased regulatory compliance or other costs or higher capital requirements

retain employees may also be harmed if our response to climate change is perceived to be ineffective or insufficient our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes tsunamis floods fires and other natural catastrophic events and other events beyond our control a major catastrophe such as an earthquake tsunami flood fire or other natural disaster including those caused or exacerbated by climate change public health issues such as the covid19 or other pandemics or other events beyond our control could result in a prolonged interruption of our business for example our headquarters are located in tacoma washington and we have operations throughout the northwest a geographical region that has been or may be affected by earthquakes wildfires tsunamis and flooding activity and in northern california a geographical region that has been and continues to be affected by earthquakes and wildfires because we primarily serve individuals and businesses in the northwest and northern california a natural disaster likely would have a greater impact on our business operations and financial condition than if our business were more geographically diverse the occurrence of any of these natural disasters could negatively impact our performance by disrupting our operations or the operations of our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows risks relating to investment in our stock there can be no assurance as to the level of dividends we may pay on our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and there may be circumstances under which we would eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock we rely on dividends and other payments from our bank for substantially all of our revenue we are a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank and we receive substantially all of our operating cash flows from dividends and other payments from the bank these dividends and payments are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our capital stock and interest and principal on any debt we may have various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock the inability to receive dividends from the bank could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects we have various antitakeover measures that could impede a takeover our articles of incorporation include certain provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer a proxy contest merger or otherwise these provisions include certain nonmonetary factors that our board of directors may consider when evaluating a takeover offer and a requirement that any business combination be approved by the affirmative vote of no less than of the total shares attributable to persons other than a control person these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a tender offer proxy contest or otherwise and may deter any potentially hostile offers or other efforts to obtain control of us this could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium for their columbia common stock even in circumstances where such action is favored by a majority of our shareholders
