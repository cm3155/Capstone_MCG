item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations table end this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report in the following discussion unless otherwise noted references to increases or decreases in average balances in items of income and expense for a particular period and balances at a particular date refer to the comparison with corresponding amounts for the period or date for the previous year critical accounting policies we have established certain accounting policies in preparing our consolidated financial statements that are in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states our significant accounting policies are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report certain of these policies require the use of judgments estimates and economic assumptions which may prove inaccurate or are subject to variation that may significantly affect our reported results of operations and financial position for the periods presented or in future periods management believes that the judgments estimates and economic assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are appropriate given the factual circumstances at the time we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements allowance for loan and lease losses the alll is an accounting estimate of incurred credit losses in our loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the primary components of the allowance are loans collectively evaluated for impairment in accordance with the fasb asc topic contingencies asc loans individually determined to be impaired in accordance with the fasb asc subtopic receivables overall asc and loans acquired with deteriorated credit quality in accordance with fasb asc subtopic receivables loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality asc the measure of estimated credit losses for the asc component is based upon the loss experience over a historical base period adjusted for a loss emergence period the loss emergence period is an estimate of the period that it takes on average for us to identify the amount of loss incurred for a loan that has suffered a losscausing event management then considers the effects of the following qualitative factors to ensure our allowance reflects the inherent losses in the loan portfolio table start economic and business conditions table endtable start concentration of credit table endtable start lending management and staff table endtable start lending policies and procedures table endtable start loss and recovery trends table endtable start nature and volume of the portfolio table endtable start trends in problem loans loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans table endtable start quality of internal loan review and table endtable start external factors table end these qualitative factors have a high degree of subjectivity and changes in any of the factors could have a significant impact on our calculation of the allowance the qualitative adjustment by loan segment is based upon managements assessment of inherent losses within a range between the weighted historical loss factor by segment and the maximum consecutive quarterly losses in the relevant loss emergence period by segment over the historical base period the measure of estimated credit losses for the asc component begins if based upon current information and events we believe it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when a loan has been modified in a tdr when a loan has been identified as impaired the amount of impairment will be measured using discounted cash flows except when it is determined that the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral in these cases the current fair value of the collateral reduced by costs to sell will be used in place of discounted cash flows as a final alternative the observable market price of the debt may be used to assess impairment the company predominantly uses the fair value of collateral approach based upon a reliable valuation our allowance policy and the judgments estimates and economic assumptions involved are described in greater detail in the allowance for loan and lease losses and unfunded commitments and letters of credit section of this discussion and in note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report table of contents adoption of allowance for credit losses asc in accordance with asu the company was required to adopt asc as of january the allowance for credit losses under asc is an accounting estimate of expected losses over the contractual life of assets carried at amortized cost within the companys loan portfolio at the balance sheet date the asu requires a financial asset or group of financial assets measured at amortized cost to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the allowance for credit losses is a valuation account that is deducted from the amortized cost basis of the financial asset to present the net carrying value at the amount expected to be collected on the financial asset the quantitative allowance is calculated using a discounted cash flow approach with a probability of default methodology the probability of default is an assumption derived from regression models which determine the relationship between historical defaults and certain economic variables the company determines a reasonable and supportable forecast and applies that forecast to the model to determine defaults over the forecast period following the forecast period the economic variables used to calculate the probability of default revert to a historical average other assumptions relevant to the discounted cash flow model to derive the quantitative allowance include the loss given default which is the estimate of loss for a defaulted loan and the discount rate applied to future cash flows the model calculates the net present value of each loan using both the contractual and expected cash flows respectively in addition to the quantitative portion of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the effects of the following qualitative factors in its calculation of expected losses in the loan portfolio table start economic and business conditions table endtable start concentration of credit table endtable start lending management and staff table endtable start lending policies and procedures table endtable start loss and recovery trends table endtable start nature and volume of the portfolio table endtable start trends in problem loans loan delinquencies and nonaccrual loans table endtable start quality of internal loan review and table endtable start external factors table end these qualitative factors are based in quantitative factors but also include a high degree of subjectivity and changes in any of the factors could have a significant impact on our calculation of the allowance loans for which repayment is expected to be provided substantially through the operation or sale of collateral are considered collateraldependent the allowance for credit losses for collateraldependent loans is measured on the basis of the fair value of the collateral when foreclosure is probable business combinations the company applies the acquisition method of accounting for business combinations under the acquisition method the acquiring entity in a business combination recognizes the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values management utilizes prevailing valuation techniques appropriate for the asset or liability being measured in determining these fair values any excess of the purchase price over amounts allocated to assets acquired including identifiable intangible assets and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill where amounts allocated to assets acquired and liabilities assumed is greater than the purchase price a bargain purchase gain is recognized acquisitionrelated costs are expensed as incurred table of contents valuation and recoverability of goodwill goodwill represented million of our billion in total assets as of december the company has a single reporting unit we review goodwill for impairment annually during the third quarter and also test for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount such events and circumstances may include among others a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the general business climate significant decline in our stock price and market capitalization unanticipated competition the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within the reporting unit and an adverse action or assessment by a regulator any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of goodwill and could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements under the intangibles goodwill and other topic of the fasb asc the testing for impairment may begin with an assessment of qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount when required the goodwill impairment test involves a twostep process in step one we would test goodwill for impairment by comparing the fair value of the reporting unit with its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill is not deemed to be impaired and no further testing is necessary if the carrying amount of the reporting unit were to exceed the fair value of the reporting unit we would perform a second test to measure the amount of impairment loss if any to measure the amount of any impairment loss we would determine the implied fair value of goodwill in the same manner as if the reporting unit were being acquired in a business combination specifically we would allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to all of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in a hypothetical calculation that would determine the implied fair value of goodwill if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill we would record an impairment charge for the difference the accounting estimates related to our goodwill require us to make considerable assumptions about fair values our assumptions regarding fair values require significant judgment about economic and industry factors and the growth and earnings prospects of the bank changes in these judgments either individually or collectively may have a significant effect on the estimated fair values based on the results of the annual goodwill impairment test we determined that no goodwill impairment charges were required as our single reporting units fair value significantly exceeded its carrying amount as of december we determined there were no events or circumstances which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting unit below its carrying amount please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report for further discussion table of contents financial

of our principal commerce activities our policies applicable laws and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management we manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints credit review approval policies and extensive ongoing internal monitoring we also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan type of industry type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower in analyzing our existing portfolio we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating size or potential risk of loss in contrast the monitoring process for the commercial business real estate construction and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loan by loan basis we review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and as a result the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly in the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured the loan is appropriately downgraded and if warranted placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments additionally we assess whether an impairment of a loan warrants specific reserves or a writedown of the loan for additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our

period indicated table start years ended december in thousands balance beginning of period loans placed on nonaccrual or restructured advances chargeoffs loans returned to accrual status repayments including interest applied to principal transfers to oreooppo balance end of period table end loans are considered impaired when based on current information and events it is probable that the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement or when a loan has been modified in a tdr a loan is classified as a tdr when a borrower is experiencing financial difficulties that lead to a restructuring of the loan and the company grants concessions to the borrower in the restructuring that it would not otherwise consider these concessions may include interest rate reductions principal forgiveness extension of maturity date and other actions intended to minimize potential losses generally a nonaccrual loan that is restructured remains on nonaccrual status for a period of six months to demonstrate that the borrower can meet the restructured terms if the borrowers performance under the new terms is not reasonably assured the loan remains classified as a nonaccrual loan the assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are designated as classified per the companys internal risk rating system or when and while such loans are on nonaccrual all nonaccrual loans greater than and all tdr loans are considered impaired and analyzed individually on a quarterly basis classified loans with an outstanding balance greater than are evaluated for potential impairment on a quarterly basis the companys policy is to record cash receipts on impaired loans first as reductions in principal and then as interest income the following table summarizes impaired loan financial data at december and table start december in thousands impaired loans impaired loans with specific allocations amount of the specific allocations table end impaired loans with a carrying amount of million at december were subject to specific allocations of alll of thousand and chargeoffs of million during the year collateral dependent impaired loans without specific allocations at december and either had collateral which exceeded the carrying value of the loans or reflected a partial chargeoff to the market value of collateral less costs to sell as of the most recent appraisal date restructured loans accruing interest totaled million and million at december and respectively when a loan with unique risk characteristics has been identified as being impaired the amount of impairment will be measured by the company using discounted cash flows except when it is determined that the remaining source of repayment for the loan is the operation or liquidation of the underlying collateral in these cases the current fair value of the collateral reduced by costs to sell will be used in place of discounted cash flows as a final alternative the observable market price of the debt may be used to assess impairment predominately the company uses the fair value of collateral approach based upon a reliable valuation table of contents when a loan secured by real estate migrates to nonperforming and impaired status and it does not have a market valuation less than one year old the company secures an updated market valuation by a thirdparty appraiser that is reviewed by the companys onstaff appraiser subsequently the asset will be appraised annually by a thirdparty appraiser or the companys onstaff appraiser the evaluation may occur more frequently if management determines that there has been increased market deterioration within a specific geographical location upon receipt and verification of the market valuation the company will record the loan at the lower of cost or market less costs to sell by recording a chargeoff to the alll or by designating a specific reserve in
