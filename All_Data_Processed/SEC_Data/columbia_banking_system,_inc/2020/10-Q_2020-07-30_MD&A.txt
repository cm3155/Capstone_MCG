accordance with our investment strategy management monitors market conditions with a view to realize gains on its available for sale securities portfolio when prudent the company performs a quarterly assessment of the debt securities available for sale in its investment portfolio that have an unrealized loss to determine whether the decline in the fair value of these securities below their amortized cost basis has resulted in a credit loss a credit loss exists when it becomes probable that the company will be unable to recover the entire amortized cost basis of its investment the companys impairment assessment takes into consideration factors such as defaults or deferrals of scheduled interest or principal external credit ratings and recent downgrades internal assessment of credit quality and whether the company intends to sell the security and whether it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the security prior to recovery of its amortized cost basis if a decline in fair value is determined to result in a credit loss an allowance is recorded table of contents when there are credit losses associated with a debt security and the company does not have the intent to sell the security and it is more likely than not that it will not have to sell the security before recovery of its cost basis the company will separate the amount of the impairment into the amount that is creditrelated and the amount related to noncredit factors the creditrelated impairment is recognized in earnings through an allowance and the noncreditrelated impairment is recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income at june the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of million compared to a net unrealized gain of million at december

this report credit risk management the extension of credit in the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal commerce activities our policies as well as applicable laws and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management we manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints credit review approval policies and extensive ongoing internal monitoring we also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower in analyzing our existing portfolio we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating size or potential risk of loss in contrast the monitoring process for the commercial business real estate construction and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loanbyloan basis we review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and as a result the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly in the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured the loan is appropriately downgraded and if warranted placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments additionally we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than and with respect to which foreclosure is probable for the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral however if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans for additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio see the allowance for credit losses section in this managements discussion and analysis and note to the consolidated financial statements in item financial
