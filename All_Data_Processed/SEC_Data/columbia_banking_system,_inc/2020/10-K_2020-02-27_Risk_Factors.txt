item risk factors table end the following is a discussion of what we currently believe are the most significant risks and uncertainties that may affect our business financial condition and future results national and global economic and other conditions could adversely affect our future results of operations or market price of our stock our business is directly impacted by factors such as economic political and market conditions broad trends in industry and finance changes in government monetary and fiscal policies and inflation foreign policy and financial market volatility all of which are beyond our control global economies continue to face significant challenges to achieving normalized economic growth rates and there are continuing concerns related to the level of us government debt and fiscal actions that may be taken to address that debt there can be no assurance that economic conditions will continue to improve and these conditions could worsen any renewed deterioration in the economies of the nation as a whole or in our markets would have an adverse effect which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects and could also cause the market price of our stock to decline economic conditions in the market areas we serve may adversely impact our earnings and could increase our credit risk associated with our loan portfolio the value of our investment portfolio and the availability of deposits substantially all of our loan and deposit customers are businesses and individuals in washington oregon and idaho and soft economies in these market areas could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects a deterioration in the market areas we serve could result in the following consequences any of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table start loan delinquencies may increase table endtable start problem assets and foreclosures may increase table endtable start collateral for loans made may decline in value in turn reducing customers borrowing power reducing the value of assets and collateral associated with existing loans table endtable start certain securities within our investment portfolio could become otherthantemporarily impaired requiring a writedown through earnings to fair value thereby reducing equity table endtable start low cost or noninterest bearing deposits may decrease and table endtable start demand for our loan and other products and services may decrease table end concentrations within our loan portfolio could result in increased credit risk in a challenging economy while our loan portfolio is diversified across business sectors it is concentrated in commercial real estate and commercial business loans these types of loans generally are viewed as having more risk of default than residential real estate loans or certain other types of loans or investments in fact the fdic has issued pronouncements alerting banks of its concern about heavy loan concentrations because our loan portfolio contains commercial real estate and commercial business loans with relatively large balances the deterioration of one or a few of these loans may cause a significant increase in our nonperforming loans an increase in nonperforming loans could result in a loss of earnings from these loans an increase in the provision for loan losses or an increase in loan chargeoffs any of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects a large percentage of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate in particular commercial real estate deterioration in the real estate market or other segments of our loan portfolio would lead to additional losses at december of our total gross loans were secured by real estate any renewed downturn in the economies or real estate values in the markets we serve could have a material adverse effect on both borrowers ability to repay their loans and the value of the real property securing such loans our ability to recover on defaulted loans would then be diminished and we would be more likely to suffer losses on defaulted loans any or all of which would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents a failure in or breach of our operational or security systems or those of our third party service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our business result in unintentional disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause losses as a financial institution our operations rely heavily on the secure processing storage and transmission of confidential and other information on our computer systems and networks any failure interruption or breach in security or operational integrity of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our online banking system customer relationship management general ledger deposit and loan servicing and other systems the security and integrity of our systems could be threatened by a variety of interruptions or information security breaches including those caused by computer hacking cyber attacks electronic fraudulent activity or attempted theft of financial assets we may not be able to anticipate detect or implement effective preventative measures against all threats particularly because the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently often are not recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources we cannot assure you that we will be able to adequately address all such failures interruptions or security breaches that may have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects while we have certain protective policies and procedures in place the nature and sophistication of the threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources in the future to modify and enhance our protective measures due to the complexity and interconnectedness of information technology systems the process of enhancing our systems can itself create a risk of systems disruptions and security issues additionally we face the risk of operational disruption failure termination or capacity constraints of any of the third parties that facilitate our business activities including exchanges clearing agents clearing houses or other financial intermediaries such parties can also be the source of an attack on or breach of our operational systems any failures interruptions or security breaches in our information systems could damage our reputation result in a loss of customer business result in a violation of privacy or other laws or expose us to civil litigation regulatory fines or losses not covered by insurance all of which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects the confidential information of our customers including user names and passwords can also be jeopardized from the compromise of customers personal electronic devices or as a result of a data security breach at an unrelated company losses due to unauthorized account activity could harm our reputation and may have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our allowance may not be adequate to cover future loan losses which could adversely affect earnings we maintain an allowance for credit losses for periods prior to january referred to as the allowance for loan and lease losses in an amount that we believe is adequate to provide for losses inherent in our loan portfolio while we strive to carefully monitor credit quality and to identify loans that may become nonperforming at any time there are loans in the portfolio that could result in losses but that have not been identified as nonperforming or potential problem loans we cannot be sure that we will be able to identify deteriorating loans before they become nonperforming assets or that we will be able to limit losses on those loans that have been identified additionally the process for determining the allowance requires different subjective and complex judgments about the future impact from current economic conditions that might impair the ability of borrowers to repay their loans as a result future significant increases to the allowance may be necessary future increases to the allowance may be required based on changes in the composition of the loans comprising the portfolio deteriorating values in underlying collateral most of which consists of real estate and changes in the financial condition of borrowers such as may result from changes in economic conditions or as a result of actual future events differing from assumptions used by management in determining the allowance we have adopted asu no financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments cecl effective january this standard requires financial institutions to determine periodic estimates of lifetime expected credit losses on financial instruments and other commitments to extend credit this standard changes the prior incurred loss model for recognizing credit losses and adoption of the new standard requires us to increase our allowance and may greatly increase the types of data we need to collect and review to determine the appropriate level of the allowance additionally banking regulators as an integral part of their supervisory function periodically review our allowance these regulatory agencies may require us to increase the allowance any increase in the allowance would have an adverse effect which could be material on our financial condition and results of operations table of contents nonperforming assets take significant time to resolve and could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition our nonperforming assets adversely affect our net income in various ways we do not record interest income on nonaccrual loans thereby adversely affecting our income and increasing loan administration costs assets acquired by foreclosure or similar proceedings are recorded at fair value less estimated costs to sell the valuation of these foreclosed assets is periodically updated and resulting losses if any are charged to earnings in the period in which they are identified an increase in the level of nonperforming assets also increases our risk profile and may impact the capital levels our regulators believe is appropriate in light of such risks we utilize various techniques such as loan sales workouts and restructurings to manage our problem assets decreases in the value of these problem assets the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial condition would have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the resolution of nonperforming assets requires significant commitments of time from management and staff which can be detrimental to performance of their other responsibilities we may experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future acquisitions and the integration of acquired businesses subject us to various risks and may not result in all of the benefits anticipated future acquisitions may be dilutive to current shareholders and future acquisitions may be delayed impeded or prohibited due to regulatory issues we have in the past and expect in the future seek to grow our business by acquiring other businesses our acquisitions may not have the anticipated positive results including results relating to correctly assessing the asset quality of the assets being acquired the total cost of integration including management attention and resources the time required to complete the integration successfully the amount of longerterm cost savings being able to profitably deploy funds acquired in an acquisition or the overall performance of the combined entity in addition unexpected contingent liabilities can arise from the businesses we acquire integration of an acquired business can be complex and costly sometimes including combining relevant accounting and data processing systems financial reporting and management and internal controls as well as managing relevant relationships with employees clients suppliers and other business partners integration efforts could divert management attention and resources which could adversely affect these systems processes or controls and our operations or results acquisitions may also result in business disruptions that cause us to lose customers or cause customers to remove their accounts from us and move their business to competing financial institutions it is possible that the integration process related to acquisitions could result in the disruption of our ongoing businesses or inconsistencies in standards controls procedures and policies that could adversely affect our ability to maintain relationships with clients customers depositors and employees the loss of key employees in connection with an acquisition could adversely affect our ability to successfully conduct our business we may engage in additional future acquisitions involving the issuance of additional common stock andor cash any such acquisitions and related issuances of stock may have a dilutive effect on eps book value per share or the percentage ownership of current shareholders the use of cash as consideration in any such acquisitions could impact our capital position and may require us to raise additional capital furthermore notwithstanding our recent acquisitions we cannot provide any assurance as to the extent to which we can continue to grow through acquisitions as this will depend on the availability of prospective target opportunities at valuations we find attractive and other factors among other things acquisitions by financial institutions are subject to approval by a variety of federal and state regulatory agencies regulatory approvals could be delayed impeded restrictively conditioned or denied due to existing or new regulatory issues we have or may have with regulatory agencies in addition the northwest is experiencing intensified consolidation and we face significant competition from numerous other financial services institutions for attractive acquisition candidates and many of these competitors have greater financial resources than we do our assumptions regarding the fair value of assets acquired could be inaccurate which could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition results of operations and future prospects management makes various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of acquired loans including the creditworthiness of borrowers and the value of the real estate and other assets serving as collateral for the repayment of secured loans if our assumptions are incorrect significant earnings volatility can occur and credit loss provisions may be needed to respond to different economic conditions or adverse developments in the acquired loan portfolio any increase in future loan losses could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents our management of capital could adversely affect profitability measures and the market price of our common stock and could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock our capital ratios are significantly higher than regulatory minimums we may lower our capital ratios through selective acquisitions that meet our disciplined criteria share repurchase plans organic loan growth investment in securities or a combination of all four we continually evaluate opportunities to expand our business through strategic acquisitions there can be no assurance that we will be able to negotiate future acquisitions on terms acceptable to us conversely there may be circumstances under which it would be prudent to consider alternatives for raising capital to take advantage of significant acquisition opportunities or in response to changing economic conditions in addition we may need to raise additional capital in the future to have sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and fund our business needs and future growth particularly if the quality of our assets or earnings were to deteriorate significantly we may not be able to raise additional capital when needed on terms acceptable to us or at all our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at the time which are outside our control and our financial performance further if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would then have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition any capital raising alternatives could dilute the holders of our outstanding common stock and may adversely affect the market price of our common stock conditions in the financial markets may limit access to additional funding to meet liquidity needs we may need or want to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and business needs particularly if our asset quality or earnings were to deteriorate significantly our ability to raise additional capital will depend on among other things conditions in the capital markets at that time which are outside of our control and our financial performance economic conditions and any loss of confidence in financial institutions generally may increase our cost of funding and limit access to certain customary sources of capital there can be no assurance that capital will be available on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets such as a decline in the confidence of equity or debt purchasers or counterparties participating in capital markets may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and potentially our liquidity also if we need to raise capital in the future we may have to do so when many other financial institutions are also seeking to raise capital and would have to compete with those institutions for investors an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations if the goodwill we have recorded in connection with acquisitions becomes impaired it could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders equity accounting standards require that we account for acquisitions using the acquisition method of accounting under acquisition accounting if the purchase price of an acquired company exceeds the fair value of its net assets the excess is carried on the acquirers balance sheet as goodwill in accordance with gaap our goodwill is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that a potential impairment exists such evaluation may be based on a variety of factors including the quoted price of our common stock market prices of common stock of other banking organizations common stock trading multiples discounted cash flows and data from comparable acquisitions future evaluations of goodwill may result in impairment and ensuing writedowns which could have a material adverse impact on our earnings and shareholders equity fluctuating interest rates could adversely affect our business significant increases in market interest rates on loans or the perception that an increase may occur could adversely affect both our ability to originate new loans and our ability to grow conversely decreases in interest rates could result in an acceleration of loan prepayments an increase in market interest rates could also adversely affect the ability of our floatingrate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations if this occurred it could cause an increase in nonperforming assets and charge offs which could adversely affect our business table of contents further our profitability is dependent to a large extent upon net interest income which is the difference or spread between the interest earned on loans securities and other interestearning assets and the interest paid on deposits borrowings and other interestbearing liabilities because of the differences in maturities and repricing characteristics of our interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities changes in interest rates do not produce equivalent changes in interest income earned on interestearning assets and interest paid on interestbearing liabilities accordingly fluctuations in interest rates could adversely affect our interest rate spread and in turn our profitability interest rates on our outstanding financial instruments might be subject to change based on regulatory developments which could adversely affect our revenue expenses and the value of those financial instruments libor and certain other benchmarks are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform these reforms may cause such benchmarks to perform differently than in the past or have other consequences which cannot be predicted on july the united kingdoms financial conduct authority which regulates libor publicly announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after it is unclear whether at that time libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark or what rate or rates may become acceptable alternatives to or replacements for libor if libor ceases to be recognized as an acceptable benchmark or to exist or if an alternative rate or rates become accepted alternatives or replacements for libor interest rates on our loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates as well as the revenue and expenses associated with those financial instruments may be adversely affected further any uncertainty regarding the continued use and reliability of libor as a benchmark interest rate could adversely affect the value of our loans deposits derivatives and other financial instruments tied to libor rates regulators industry groups and certain committees eg the alternative reference rates committee have among other things published recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments identified recommended alternatives for certain libor rates eg the secured overnight financing rate as the recommended alternative to us dollar libor and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments at this time it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments our business depends on our ability to successfully manage credit risk the operation of our business requires us to manage credit risk as a lender we are exposed to the risk that our borrowers will be unable to repay their loans according to their terms and that the collateral securing repayment of their loans if any may not be sufficient to ensure repayment in addition there are risks inherent in making any loan including risks with respect to the period of time over which the loan may be repaid risks relating to proper loan underwriting risks resulting from changes in economic and industry conditions and risks inherent in dealing with individual borrowers in order to successfully manage credit risk we must among other things maintain disciplined and prudent underwriting standards and ensure that our bankers follow those standards the weakening of these standards for any reason such as an attempt to attract higher yielding loans a lack of discipline or diligence by our employees in underwriting and monitoring loans the inability of our employees to adequately adapt policies and procedures to changes in economic or any other conditions affecting borrowers and the quality of our loan portfolio may result in loan defaults foreclosures and additional chargeoffs and may necessitate that we increase our alll each of which could adversely affect our net income as a result our inability to successfully manage credit risk could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents we operate in a highly regulated environment and changes to or increases in or supervisory enforcement of banking or other laws and regulations or governmental fiscal or monetary policies could adversely affect us we are subject to extensive regulation supervision and examination by federal and state banking authorities in addition as a publiclytraded company we are subject to regulation by the sec any change in applicable regulations or federal state or local legislation or in policies or interpretations or regulatory approaches to compliance and enforcement income tax laws and accounting principles could have a substantial impact on us and our operations changes in laws and regulations may also increase our expenses by imposing additional fees or taxes or restrictions on our operations additional legislation and regulations that could significantly affect our powers authority and operations may be enacted or adopted in the future which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects failure to appropriately comply with any such laws regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies or damage to our reputation all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations for example the doddfrank act was enacted in july among other provisions the legislation i created the cfpb with broad powers to regulate consumer financial products such as credit cards and mortgages ii resulted in new capital requirements from federal banking agencies iii placed new limits on electronic debit card interchange fees and iv required the sec and national stock exchanges to adopt significant new corporate governance and executive compensation reforms some of which have yet to be promulgated the doddfrank act and regulations that have been adopted thereunder have increased the overall costs of regulatory compliance and further regulatory developments whether related to doddfrank or otherwise may lead to additional costs in addition the cfpb has broad rulemaking authority and is the principal federal regulatory agency responsible for the supervision and enforcement of a wide range of consumer protection laws for banks with greater than billion in assets if we fail to maintain appropriate levels of capital or liquidity we could become subject to formal or informal enforcement actions that may impose restrictions on our business including limiting our lending activities or our ability to expand requiring us to raise additional capital which may be dilutive to shareholders or requiring regulatory approval to pay dividends or otherwise return capital to shareholders further regulators have significant discretion and authority to prevent or remedy unsafe or unsound practices or violations of laws or regulations by financial institutions and holding companies in the performance of their supervisory and enforcement duties the exercise of regulatory authority may have an adverse impact which could be material on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects additionally our business is affected significantly by the fiscal and monetary policies of the us federal government and its agencies including the federal reserve we cannot accurately predict the full effects of recent legislation or the various other governmental regulatory monetary and fiscal initiatives which have been and may be enacted on the financial markets on the company and on the bank the terms and costs of these activities or any worsening of current financial market and economic conditions could materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations as well as the trading price of our common stock we may be required in the future to recognize impairment with respect to investment securities our securities portfolio currently includes securities with unrecognized losses at december gross unrealized losses in our securities portfolio were million we may continue to observe declines in the fair market value of these securities securities issued by certain states and municipalities have recently come under scrutiny due to concerns about credit quality although management believes the credit quality of the companys state and municipal securities portfolio to be good there can be no assurance that the credit quality of these securities will not decline in the future we evaluate the securities portfolio for any otherthantemporary impairment each reporting period as required by gaap in the united states there can be no assurance however that future evaluations of the securities portfolio will not require us to recognize impairment charges with respect to these and other holdings for example it is possible that governmentsponsored programs to allow mortgages to be refinanced to lower rates could materially adversely impact the yield on our portfolio of mortgagebacked securities since a significant portion of our investment portfolio is composed of such securities substantial competition in our market areas could adversely affect us commercial banking is a highly competitive business we compete with other commercial banks savings and loan associations credit unions and finance insurance and other nondepository companies operating in our market areas we also experience competition especially for deposits from internetbased banking institutions which have grown rapidly in recent years we are subject to substantial competition for loans and deposits from other financial institutions some of our competitors are not subject to the same degree of regulation and restriction as we are andor have greater financial resources than we do some of our competitors may have liquidity issues which could impact the pricing of deposits loans and other financial products in our markets our inability to effectively compete in our market areas could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents we may not be able to attract or retain key employees our success depends in significant part on the skills of our management team and our ability to retain recruit and motivate key officers and employees we expect our future success to be driven in large part by the relationships maintained with our clients by our executives and other key employees leadership changes will occur from time to time and we cannot predict whether significant resignations or other departures will occur or whether we will be able to recruit additional qualified personnel competition for senior executives and skilled personnel in the financial services and banking industry is intense which means the cost of hiring incentivizing and retaining skilled personnel may continue to increase we need to continue to attract and retain key personnel and to recruit qualified individuals to succeed existing key personnel to ensure the continued growth and successful operation of our business the unexpected loss of any such employees or the inability to recruit and retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects in addition the scope and content of us banking regulators regulations and policies on incentive compensation as well as changes to these regulations and policies could adversely affect our ability to hire retain and motivate our key employees changes in accounting standards could materially impact our financial statements from time to time the fasb and the sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations fasbs asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments became effective on january the amendments in this asu introduce a new impairment model based on cecl rather than incurred losses the cecl model applies to most debt instruments including loan receivables and loan commitments unlike the incurred loss models the cecl model does not specify a threshold for the recognition of an impairment allowance rather the company must recognize an impairment allowance equal to its current estimate of expected credit losses for financial instruments as of the end of the reporting period measuring expected credit losses will most likely be a significant challenge for all entities including the company further the impairment allowance measured under the cecl model will differ from the impairment allowance measured under the companys prior incurred loss model to initially apply the amendments the company has recorded a cumulativeeffect adjustment to its consolidated balance sheets as of january a modified retrospective approach the adoption of the standard has resulted in an overall increase in the allowance for credit losses it is also possible that the companys ongoing reported earnings and lending activity will be negatively impacted in periods following adoption there can be no assurance as to the level of dividends we may pay on our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board of directors declares out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and there may be circumstances under which we would eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock we rely on dividends and other payments from our bank for substantially all of our revenue we are a separate and distinct legal entity from the bank and we receive substantially all of our operating cash flows from dividends and other payments from the bank these dividends and payments are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our capital stock and interest and principal on any debt we may have various federal and state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that the bank may pay to us also our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors in the event the bank is unable to pay dividends to us we may not be able to service debt pay obligations or pay dividends on our common stock the inability to receive dividends from the bank could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects table of contents our ability to sustain or improve upon existing performance is dependent upon our ability to respond to technological change and we may have fewer resources than some of our competitors to continue to invest in technological improvements the financial services industry is undergoing rapid technological changes with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements than we do our future success will depend in part upon our ability to address the needs of our clients by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy client demands for convenience as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers in addition the implementation of technological changes and upgrades to maintain current systems and integrate new ones may also cause service interruptions transaction processing errors and system conversion delays and may cause us to fail to comply with applicable laws there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully manage the risks associated with our increased dependency on technology we are exposed to the risk of environmental liabilities in connection with real properties acquired during the ordinary course of business we foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans in doing so there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties if previously unknown or undisclosed hazardous or toxic substances are discovered we may be liable for remediation costs as well as for personal injury and property damage environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses which may materially reduce the affected propertys value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property in addition future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement polices with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review at the time of underwriting a loan secured by real property and also before initiating any foreclosure action on real property these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations significant legal or regulatory actions could subject us to substantial uninsured liabilities and reputational harm and have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations we are from time to time subject to claims and proceedings related to our operations claims and legal actions including supervisory or enforcement actions by our regulators or criminal proceedings by prosecutorial authorities could involve large monetary claims including civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and significant defense costs to mitigate the cost of some of these claims we maintain insurance coverage in amounts and with deductibles that we believe are appropriate for our operations however our insurance coverage does not cover any civil money penalties or fines imposed by government authorities and may not cover all other claims that might be brought against us or continue to be available to us at a reasonable cost as a result we may be exposed to substantial uninsured liabilities which could adversely affect our business prospects results of operations and financial condition substantial legal liability or significant regulatory action against us could cause significant reputational harm to us andor could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects because we primarily serve individuals and businesses located in the northwest any negative impact resulting from reputational harm including any impact on our ability to attract and retain customers and employees likely would be greater than if our business were more geographically diverse we are subject to a variety of operational risks including reputational risk legal risk and compliance risk and the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders which may adversely affect our business and results of operations we are exposed to many types of operational risks including reputational risk legal and compliance risk the risk of fraud or theft by employees or outsiders and unauthorized transactions by employees or operational errors including clerical or recordkeeping errors or those resulting from faulty or disabled computer or telecommunications systems the public perception of financial institutions remains negative our reputation and businesses may be adversely affected by negative publicity or information regarding our businesses and personnel whether or not accurate or true that may be posted on social media or other internet forums or published by news organizations the speed and pervasiveness with which information can be disseminated through these channels in particular social media may magnify risks relating to negative publicity table of contents if personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information of customers in our possession were to be mishandled or misused we could suffer significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss such mishandling or misuse could include for example if such information were erroneously provided to parties who are not permitted to have the information either by fault of our systems employees or counterparties or where such information is intercepted or otherwise inappropriately taken by third parties because the nature of the financial services business involves a high volume of transactions certain errors may be repeated or compounded before they are discovered and successfully rectified our necessary dependence upon automated systems to record and process transactions and our large transaction volume may further increase the risk that technical flaws or employee tampering or manipulation of those systems will result in losses that are difficult to detect we are also subject to disruptions of our operating systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example computer viruses or electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters disease pandemics or other damage to property or physical assets that can give rise to disruption of service to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as we are and to the risk that we or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate the occurrence of any of these risks could result in a diminished ability of us to operate our business for example by requiring us to expend significant resources to correct the defect as well as potential liability to clients reputational damage and regulatory intervention which could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects failure to maintain effective internal control over financial reporting or disclosure controls and procedures may adversely affect our business and results of operations management regularly reviews and updates our internal control over financial reporting disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures we maintain controls and procedures to mitigate risks such as processing system failures or errors and customer or employee fraud and we maintain insurance coverage for certain of these risks any system of controls and procedures however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and provides only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met events could occur which are not prevented or detected by our internal controls are not insured against or are in excess of our insurance limits any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have an adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and prospects our business is subject to the risks of earthquakes tsunamis floods fires and other natural catastrophic events a major catastrophe such as an earthquake tsunami flood fire or other natural disaster could result in a prolonged interruption of our business for example our headquarters are located in tacoma washington and we have operations throughout the northwest a geographical region that has been or may be affected by earthquake tsunami and flooding activity because we primarily serve individuals and businesses in the northwest a natural disaster likely would have a greater impact on our business operations and financial condition than if our business were more geographically diverse the occurrence of any of these natural disasters could negatively impact our performance by disrupting our operations or the operations of our customers which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows we have various antitakeover measures that could impede a takeover our articles of incorporation include certain provisions that could make it more difficult to acquire us by means of a tender offer a proxy contest merger or otherwise these provisions include certain nonmonetary factors that our board of directors may consider when evaluating a takeover offer and a requirement that any business combination be approved by the affirmative vote of no less than of the total shares attributable to persons other than a control person these provisions may have the effect of lengthening the time required for a person to acquire control of us through a tender offer proxy contest or otherwise and may deter any potentially hostile offers or other efforts to obtain control of us this could deprive our shareholders of opportunities to realize a premium for their columbia common stock even in circumstances where such action is favored by a majority of our shareholders
