market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions to keep net interest margin as stable as possible truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies deposit beta assumptions to nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income gradual change in prime rate bps prime rate dec dec dec dec up up no change down down the down and rate scenarios incorporate a floor of one basis point truist financial corporation truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum negative impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truists primary measures of interest rate risk maximum decrease in net interest income of for the next months assuming a basis point gradual change in interest rates over four quarters and a maximum decrease in net interest income of for the next months assuming an immediate basis point parallel shock change in interest rates this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry was very strong postcovid19 which resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits however with the significant increase in rates in noninterestbearing deposits have begun to disintermediate to interestbearing accounts additional balance movement above what is currently projected would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company may increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source alternatively the company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterestbearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheets asset sensitivity the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company may increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of additional demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits versus current projections under various interest rate scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at table deposit mix sensitivity analysis gradual change in rates bps base scenario at december results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december as presented in the preceding table truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist has utilized derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of december truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net negative fair value of billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor transition for most tenors of us dollar libor the administrator of libor extended publication until june to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate management formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to executive leadership and the board as of december truist had outstanding liborbased instruments that mature after june including loan and lease exposures totaling approximately billion notional derivative exposure totaling approximately billion longterm debt of billion and preferred stock of billion these amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts which contain adequate fallback language for the transition contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from libor impacted lines of business have started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language or amending contracts to new reference rates at maturities or based on client request current fallback language used to remediate contracts that mature after june is generally consistent with arrc recommendations and includes use of hardwired fallback language which will transition loans to a sofr based rate after june truist financial corporation the progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement for commercial lending a significant number of remaining libor contracts will require client outreach and remediation through mid2022 the companys primary focus was supporting new loan production using sofr and other alternative reference rates as well as transitioning any renewing libor based contracts to alternative reference rates efforts have shifted to amend and remediate contracts excluding mortgage and student loans that mature post june billion which will continue to be the focus during of the contracts remaining on libor that have not yet been remediated or modified to a new reference rate truists intends to add update fallback language or move these contracts to new references rates prior to cessation a significant portion of these contracts contain existing fallback language that will transition the contract to a prime based rate if not remediated while a smaller population contains no historical fallback language should the institution be unable to remediate all contracts those based on prime will be prioritized to provide a more consistent client experience with the hardwired fallback transition to sofr if there are remaining contracts without fallback language truist may leverage recent legislation and corresponding safe harbor provision to transition these loans to sofr truists adjustablerate mortgage products billion have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from libor in line with industry expectations therefore these contracts will not require remediation remediation of student loans billion will follow pending guidance from the department of education on the replacement rate for payment allowances on certain student loans and recent guidance from the cfpb to allow transition to comparable rates in the private student loan portfolio where libor is used directly upon the discontinuation of libor derivatives that reference libor will transition to a sofrbased replacement rate as set forth in the isda protocol addressing libor fallbacks or as established under the recently passed adjustable interest rate libor act and rules promulgated thereunder by the frb certain derivatives without a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate will use the recent federal legislation to replace libor with a sofrbased rate established by frb rulemaking and follow the isda protocol for transition this legislation will also provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language and have not yet been remediated providing a remediation path to a sofr based rate in addition the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate such as sofr for the companys preferred stock and the companys and truist banks floating rate notes is dependent on a number of factors including the fallback language for the applicable series of preferred stock or notes the application of the libor act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the frb determinations to be made by thirdparty calculation or paying agents rather than the company or truist bank as to the replacement rates and the impact of any publication of a synthetic us dollar libor as currently proposed by the financial conduct authority see note shareholders equity for information about preferred stock using libor training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during the first half of truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition as of december truist ceased entering into new contracts with a libor reference rate for all product offerings except on a limited basis as permissible the company is actively using sofr as a reference rate and has originated approximately billion of loans issued billion of longterm debt and has billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of december alternatives such as sofr may react differently from libor in times of economic stress truist expects sofr to be the primary pricing benchmark used across the industry and will continue to offer additional sofr based products market risks associated with the transition to alternative reference rates are dependent on market conditions as loans are transitioned to alternative reference rates during and early additional alternative reference rates such as bloomberg short term bank yield will be supported based on market demand other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for libor based on market developments for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates refer to the section titled item1a risk factors market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies securitizations as of december the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was million all of which were nonagency asset backed securities positions consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the months ended december and average one and tenday var measures for the year ended december increased from the same period of last year primarily driven by higher market volatility in maximum one and tenday var measures for the year ended december were lower than as heightened market volatility experienced during march was used for measuring var until march truist financial

of market risk capital is calculated using the same internal models as used for the varbased measure stressed var is calculated over a tenday holding period at a onetail confidence level and employs a

summarizes stressed varbased measures table stressed varbased measures day holding period year ended december  in millions maximum average minimum periodend compared to the prior year the average stressed var measures increased primarily due to higher market making inventory levels in specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk oversight mro is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mro policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default inability or unwillingness of a borrower obligor or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to truist or otherwise perform as agreed credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower obligor or counterparty credit risk arises when truist funds are extended committed invested or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements whether on or offbalance sheet credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds has deteriorated truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower establishing a process for credit approval accountability careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower transaction market and collateral risks ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships continuous monitoring of the portfolio market dynamics and the economy and periodically reevaluating the companys strategy and overall exposure as economic market and other relevant conditions change truist financial corporation the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truists lending function underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk therefore proper loan underwriting is critical to truists longterm financial success truists underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific riskmitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truists risk philosophy provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals cash flow and debt service coverage cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrowers cash flow or if not must be justified by secondary repayment sources secondary sources of repayment alternative repayment funds are a significant riskmitigating factor as long as they are liquid can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source value of any underlying collateral loans are generally secured by the asset being financed because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor collateral unless it is liquid does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrowers normal cash flows overall creditworthiness of the client taking into account the clients relationships both past and current with truist and other lenders truists success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients which involves assessing their financial position and background level of equity invested in the transaction in general borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances refer to the lending activities section in mda for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that i truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding funding liquidity risk or ii truist cannot easily

repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and afs securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity growing core deposits loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs against days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that truist and truist bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institutionspecific and marketwide adverse scenarios each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition contractual maturities reductions in unsecured and secured funding and increased draws on unfunded commitments to mitigate liquidity outflows truist has identified sources of liquidity however access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truists liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective calendarday period of stress eligible hqla for purposes of calculating the lcr is the amount of unencumbered hqla that satisfy operational requirements of the lcr rule truist and truist bank are subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements truist held average weighted eligible hqla of billion and truists average lcr was for the three months ended december effective july truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities at december the company was compliant with this requirement truist financial corporation sources of funds management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truists on and offbalance sheet obligations truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits secured and unsecured capital markets funding and shareholders equity truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds markets and retail brokered cds truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances repurchase agreements and the frb discount

eligible cash at the frb table selected liquidity sources dollars in millions dec dec unused borrowing capacity frb fhlb available investment securities after haircuts available secured borrowing capacity eligible cash at the frb total at december truist banks available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in oneyear or less fhlb unused borrowing capacity was billion at december down from billion at december primarily due to increases in shortterm borrowings parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries the parent companys assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank equity investments in subsidiaries advances to subsidiaries and notes receivable from subsidiaries the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on longterm debt the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries

subsidiaries dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders repurchases of common stock and payments on longterm debt see note parent company financial information for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions therefore truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments debt service common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash inflows truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows in determining the buffer truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to affiliates serving as a source of strength to truist bank and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital

liquidity and is a key element in the management of truists capital position management intends to maintain capital at truist bank at levels that exceed the minimum capital plus ccb this will also result in truist bank being wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes secondarily it is managements intent to maintain truist banks capital at levels that result in regulatory riskbased capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size complexity and risk profile if the capital levels of truist bank increase above these guidelines excess capital may be transferred to the

previously reported shareholders equity or net income refer to note basis of presentation for additional discussion regarding reclassifications critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of truist are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities the financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position andor consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding truists accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly truists significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in note basis of presentation the following is a summary of truists critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis truist financial corporation acl truists acl represents managements best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and offbalance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and managements judgement the models are designed to forecast probability of default exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics the macroeconomic data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to longterm historical loss conditions over a oneyear period as a means of addressing uncertainty related to future economic conditions the quantitative allowance includes an adjustment that reflects model output calculated using a range of potential future economic conditions expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr a qualitative allowance which incorporates managements judgement is also included in the estimation of expected future loan and lease losses including qualitative adjustments in circumstances where the model output is inconsistent with managements expectations with respect to expected credit losses this allowance is used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to the current economic conditions and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process under the range of scenarios considered as of december use of the companys pessimistic scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately billion this estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario the company individually evaluates expected credits losses related to loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and loans that have been classified as a tdr for individually evaluated loans the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral if any while for tdrs default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments including the probability of funding and exposure at default a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in note basis of presentation fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments refer to note fair value disclosures for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and note business combinations for additional disclosures regarding business combinations securities truist generally utilizes a thirdparty pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs investment securities whereas trading securities are priced internally fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from marketbased pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields benchmark securities reported trades offers bids issuer spreads and broker quotes management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the thirdparty service provider these procedures which are performed independent of the responsible business unit include comparison of pricing information received from the thirdparty pricing service to other thirdparty pricing sources review of additional information provided by the thirdparty pricing service and other thirdparty sources for selected securities and backtesting to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the thirdparty pricing service the enterprise valuation committee which provides oversight to truists enterprisewide ipv function is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the thirdparty pricing service or internally to other thirdparty pricing sources approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hardtoprice securities when market observable data is not available which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions truist financial corporation msrs truists primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages residential msrs do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices while sales of msrs do occur the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available accordingly truist estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios which are then discounted at riskadjusted rates the oas model considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees prepayment assumptions delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenue costs to service and other economic factors truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys recent market activity actual portfolio experience and when available observable market data due to the nature of the valuation inputs residential msrs are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds in general during periods of declining interest rates the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgagerefinance activity conversely during periods of rising interest rates the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs refer to note loan servicing for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in managements assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs lhfs truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans changes in the fair value are recorded as components of mortgage banking income while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans lhfs also includes certain loans generally carried at locom where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value up to the original carrying amount and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income the fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available when observable market prices are not available the company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value refer to note basis of presentation for further description of the companys accounting for lhfs trading loans truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose specifically loans included within this classification include trading loans that are i purchased in connection with the companys trs business ii part of the loan sales and trading business within the ccb segment or iii backed by the sba refer to note commitments and contingencies and note derivative financial instruments for further discussion of the companys trs business the loans purchased in connection with the companys trs and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a thirdparty pricing service sba loans are fully guaranteed by the us government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value derivative assets and liabilities truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit in addition certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates foreign exchange equity and credit the fair value of interest rate lock commitments which are related to mortgage loan commitments is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee refer to note derivative financial instruments for further information on the companys derivatives truist financial corporation goodwill and other intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values this often involves estimates based on thirdparty valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques which are inherently subjective the amortization of definitelived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received which is also subjective business combinations also typically result in goodwill which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates refer to note basis of presentation for a description of the impairment testing process at december truists reporting units with goodwill balances were cbw ccb and ih management reviews the goodwill of each reporting unit for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value for its annual impairment review truist elected to perform a qualitative test of each of its reporting units in performing the qualitative assessment as of october the company evaluated events and circumstances since the last quantitative goodwill assessment macroeconomic conditions truists own operations key financial metrics as well as reporting unit and company financial performance and the industry in which it operates after assessing all relevant events or circumstances truist concluded that it is not morelikelythannot that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value the company also performs sensitivity analyses around the assumptions used in the most recent quantitative test as well as relevant events or circumstances in order to assess the reasonableness of the assumptions and the resulting estimated fair values while the companys sensitivity analyses did not indicate risk of impairment as of october future potential changes in these assumptions may impact the estimated fair value of a reporting unit and cause the fair value of the reporting unit to be below its carrying value additionally a reporting units carrying value could change based on market conditions asset growth or the risk profile of those reporting units which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value the company monitored events and circumstances during the fourth quarter of concluding that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december income taxes truist is subject to income tax laws of the us its states and the municipalities in which the company conducts business in estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future the company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes regulations judicial precedent and other pertinent information the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the companys tax positions including evaluating uncertain tax positions changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize dtas recognizing a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary the company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws as well as estimates of future pretax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards for additional income tax information refer to note basis of presentation and note income taxes pension and postretirement benefit obligations truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an aa above median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations truist financial corporation management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense for the companys qualified plans a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately million for while a decrease of basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately million in pension expense for this estimate reflects the sensitivity of certain factors considered in calculation of pension expense but does not consider all factors that could increase or decrease estimates calculated the calculation of pension assets and liabilities is also impacted by the yearend valuation which takes into account the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the estimated return on plan assets that was recognized during the year as well as an updated discount rate based on current market rates the yearend valuation resulted in a pretax loss in other comprehensive income of billion for all pension plans as expected return on plan assets is determined with the prior yearends plan asset valuation the lower yearend plan asset valuation and related amortization of accumulated other comprehensive income will reduce the expected return on plan assets component of net periodic pension cost recognized in other expense in refer to note
