management framework supported by people processes and systems to identify measure monitor manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities effective risk management involves optimizing risk and return while operating in a safe and sound manner and promoting compliance with applicable laws and regulations the companys risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying measuring responding to monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization the risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces both presently and in the future and the companys position on managing risk to acceptable levels truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys purpose mission and values and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the companys culture the truist code of ethics guides the companys decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations risktaking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive riskadjusted returns while preserving asset value and capital compensation decisions take into account a teammates adherence to and successful implementation of truists risk values and associated policies and procedures the companys compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risktaking behavior truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the residual risks associated with integrating heritage bbt and heritage suntrust while integration activities are largely complete the board and executive leadership oversee the change management program which is designed to ensure appropriate oversight of application and data center decommissioning and residual integration activities achieved through truists risk management process truist financial corporation refer to truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional disclosures under the section titled risk management market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions to keep net interest margin as stable as possible truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies deposit beta assumptions to nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist utilizes a tiered deposit beta assumption framework that accounts for historically observed behaviors of clients and the company as interest rates rise the deposit beta assumptions also rise to reflect increasing competition among banks as well as increased client demand for interestbearing deposits based on the fed funds target range at june of to truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately for the next basis point increase in the federal funds rate and approximately for any additional increases truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income gradual change in prime rate bps prime rate jun jun jun jun up up no change down down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices truist financial corporation rate sensitivity decreased compared to prior periods primarily driven by higher starting rates and higher deposit betas as rates increase and move into the higher beta tiers management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits consistent with the industry truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company may increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source alternatively the company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterestbearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheets asset sensitivity the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of additional demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits versus current projections under various interest rate scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at table deposit mix sensitivity analysis gradual change in rates bps base scenario at june results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at june as presented in the preceding table truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist has utilized derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of june truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net negative fair value of million see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures to protect against any potential downside in rates truist added billion of receive fixed swaps which are primarily forward starting these swaps will begin in and and have laddered maturities that primarily range from to years with an average blended interest rate of libor transition for most tenors of us dollar libor the administrator of libor extended publication until june tenors used infrequently by truist including one week and two month us dollar libor and all nonus dollar libor ceased publication at december based on the october interagency joint statement on managing the libor transition to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate management formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to executive leadership and the board as of june truist had outstanding liborbased instruments that mature after june including loan and lease exposures totaling approximately billion notional derivative exposure totaling approximately billion longterm debt of billion and preferred stock of billion these amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts which contain adequate fallback language for the transition contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from libor for impacted lines of business the company has started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language or amending contracts to new reference rates at maturities during current fallback language used to remediate contracts that mature after june is generally consistent with arrc recommendations and includes use of hardwired fallback language truist financial corporation the progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement for commercial lending and general consumer lending a significant number of remaining libor contracts will require client outreach and remediation progress year to date has been focused on maturities earlier than june and expanding usage of alternative reference rates efforts to amend and remediate contracts excluding mortgage and student loans that mature post june billion will be accelerated during the remainder of truist has determined that adjustable rate mortgage products billion have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from libor in line with industry expectations therefore these contracts will not require remediation remediation of student loans billion will follow pending guidance from the department of education on the replacement rate for certain student loans and recent guidance from the cfpb to allow transition to comparable rates including sofr or prime in the private student loan portfolio where libor is used directly certain derivatives without a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate will use the recent federal legislation to replace libor with a sofrbased rate that will be established by frb rulemaking this legislation will also provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language and have not yet been remediated training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during and the first half of truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition as of december truist ceased entering into new contracts with a libor reference rate for all product offerings except on a limited basis as permissible market risks associated with the transition to alternative reference rates are dependent on market conditions as loans are transitioned to alternative reference rates during and early the company is actively using sofr as a reference rate and has originated approximately billion of loans issued billion of longterm debt and has billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of june alternatives such as sofr may react differently from libor in times of economic stress truist expects sofr to become a more commonlyused pricing benchmark across the industry and will continue to offer additional sofr based products during additional alternative reference rates such as bloomberg short term bank yield will be supported based on market demand other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for libor based on market developments for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates refer to the section titled item1a risk factors in the form 10k for the year ended december market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies truist financial corporation securitizations as of june the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was million all of which were nonagency asset backed securities positions consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of june varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three months and six months ended june and average one and tenday var measures for the three months ended june increased from the same period of last year primarily driven by higher market volatility over the past quarter average one and

inventory levels in specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market

method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph var measures briefly increased in the first quarter of due to the increase in market volatility that normalized towards the end of the quarter there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended june the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital

to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other critical teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the
