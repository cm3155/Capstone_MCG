truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions to keep net interest margin as stable as possible truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies deposit beta assumptions to nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts that are not contractually tied to an index when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist utilizes a tiered deposit beta assumption framework that accounts for historically observed behaviors of clients and the company the deposit beta assumptions are reduced when interest rates are exceptionally low and competition for interestbearing deposits is commensurately low as interest rates rise the deposit beta assumptions also rise to reflect increasing competition among banks as well as increased client demand for interestbearing deposits truist applies an average deposit beta of approximately for the first basis point increase in the federal funds rate approximately for the second basis point increase and approximately for any additional increases truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income gradual change in prime rate bps prime rate mar mar mar mar up up no change down down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices rate sensitivity increased compared to prior periods primarily driven by a change to the companys deposit beta assumptions partially offset by an increase in the investment securities portfolio truist financial corporation management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits consistent with the industry truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company may increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source alternatively the company may reduce the size of its investment portfolio to offset the loss of noninterestbearing demand deposits to limit the impact on the balance sheets asset sensitivity the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of additional demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits versus current projections under various interest rate scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at table deposit mix sensitivity analysis gradual change in rates bps base scenario at march results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at march as presented in the preceding table truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist hedges a portion of its afs securities to reduce marktomarket volatility within aoci and also to increase its overall asset sensitivity position truist has utilized derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of march truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net fair value of million see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor transition for most tenors of us dollar libor the administrator of libor extended publication until june tenors used infrequently by truist including one week and two month us dollar libor and all nonus dollar libor ceased publication at december based on the october interagency joint statement on managing the libor transition to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate management formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index or multiple indices and provides updates to executive leadership and the board as of march truist had outstanding liborbased instruments that mature after june including loan and lease exposures totaling approximately billion notional derivative exposure totaling approximately billion longterm debt of billion and preferred stock of billion these amounts are inclusive of remediated contracts which contain adequate fallback language for the transition contract fallback language for existing loans and leases has largely been reviewed and certain contracts will require amendments to support the transition away from libor for impacted lines of business the company has started remediating these contracts to include standardized fallback language current fallback language used for new renewed and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations and includes use of hardwired fallback language where appropriate the progress and approach to remediation will vary based on the type of contract and existing language used in the agreement for commercial lending and general consumer lending a significant number of remaining libor contracts will require client outreach and remediation efforts to amend and remediate contracts excluding mortgage and student loans that mature post june billion will be accelerated in truist has determined that adjustable rate mortgage products billion have consistent and adequate fallback language to transition away from libor in line with industry expectations therefore these contracts will not require remediation remediation of student loans billion will depend on guidance from the department of education and recent guidance from the cfpb to allow transition to comparable rates including sofr or prime certain derivatives without a clearly defined or practicable replacement benchmark rate will use the recent federal legislation to replace libor with a sofrbased rate that will be established by frb rulemaking this legislation will also provide additional administrative benefit for a small portion of the commercial and consumer lending portfolios where contracts do not contain fallback language truist financial corporation training has been provided for impacted teammates and will continue during truist will continue to provide timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition during and the first half of truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness to support the transition as of december truist ceased entering into new contracts with a libor reference rate for all product offerings except on a limited basis as permissible market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions as of the transition the company is actively using sofr as a reference rate and has originated approximately billion of loans issued billion of longterm debt and has billion in notional derivative exposure using this alternative reference rate as of march truist expects sofr to become a more commonlyused pricing benchmark across the industry and will continue to offer additional sofr based products during additional alternative reference rates such as bloomberg short term bank yield will be supported based on market demand other emerging credit sensitive rates will be evaluated as additional alternatives for libor based on market developments for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates refer to the section titled item1a risk factors in the form 10k for the year ended december market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies securitizations as of march the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was million all of which were nonagency asset backed securities positions consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of march truist financial corporation varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three months ended march and average one and ten day var measures declined from last year as heightened market volatility experienced during march aged out of the 12month var lookback window table varbased measures three months ended march

normalization of market making inventory levels this year specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply truist financial corporation var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph var measures briefly increased in the first quarter of due to the increase in market volatility that normalized towards the end of the quarter there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended march the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and to identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and afs securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity growing core deposits loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale truist financial corporation truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs against days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that truist and truist bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institutionspecific and marketwide adverse scenarios each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition contractual maturities reductions in unsecured and secured funding and increased draws on unfunded commitments to mitigate liquidity outflows truist has identified sources of liquidity however access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truists liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other critical teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective calendarday period of stress eligible hqla for purposes of calculating the lcr is the amount of unencumbered hqla that satisfy operational requirements of the lcr rule truist and truist bank are subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements truist held average weighted eligible hqla of billion and truists average lcr was for the three months ended march effective july truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities at march the company was compliant with this requirement sources of funds management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truists on and offbalance sheet obligations truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits secured and unsecured capital markets funding and shareholders equity truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds markets and retail brokered cds truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances repurchase agreements and the frb discount window the following table presents a summary of truist banks available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the frb truist financial corporation table liquidity sources dollars in millions mar dec unused borrowing capacity frb fhlb available investment securities after haircuts available secured borrowing capacity eligible cash at the frb total at march truist banks available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately

of common stock and payments on longterm debt see note parent company financial information in truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions therefore truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments debt service common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash inflows truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows in determining the buffer truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to affiliates serving as a source of strength to truist bank and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets at march and
