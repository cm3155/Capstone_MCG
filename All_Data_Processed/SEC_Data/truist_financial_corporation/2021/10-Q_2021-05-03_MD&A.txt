identifying measuring responding to monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization the risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces both presently and in the future and the companys position on managing risk to acceptable levels truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys purpose mission and values and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the companys culture the truist code of ethics guides the companys decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations risktaking activities are evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive riskadjusted returns while preserving asset value and capital compensation decisions take into account a teammates adherence to and successful implementation of truists risk values and associated policies and procedures the companys compensation structure supports its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risktaking behavior truist employs a comprehensive change management program to manage the risks associated with integrating heritage bbt and heritage suntrust the board and executive leadership oversee the change management program which is designed to ensure key decisions are reviewed and that there is appropriate oversight of integration activities refer to truists annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for additional disclosures under the section titled risk management market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists bus interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates truist financial corporation the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes of approximately percent to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income linear change in prime rate bps prime rate mar mar mar mar up up no change down down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices rate sensitivity increased compared to the prior periods primarily driven by increased deposits as a result of government stimulus programs management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits consistent with the industry truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company would increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at percent table deposit mix sensitivity analysis linear change in rates bps base scenario at march results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at march as presented in the preceding table truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve truist financial corporation the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve simulation analysis change in interest rates bps hypothetical percentage change in eve mar mar up no change down truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of march truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net fair value of billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor in its current form was anticipated to no longer be available after for most tenors of

publication at december based on this new guidance truist has us dollar liborbased contracts that extend beyond june to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate management has formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index the project team provides updates to executive leadership and the board contract fallback language for existing loans and leases is under review and certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition current fallback language used for new renewed and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations updates to current fallback language will be evaluated according to new regulatory guidance for the extension of timelines for the transition and expectations for production of us dollar libor contracts during truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness for the

the industry truist continues to evaluate sofr for additional product offerings and other alternative reference rates as replacements for libor market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all covered positions additionally trading positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies truist financial corporation securitizations as of march the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was million all of which were nonagency asset backed securities positions consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of march varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail percent confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a percent confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing profit and loss attribution and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three months ended march and heightened market volatility experienced during march significantly impacted the yearoveryear comparison table varbased measures three

peak march volatility which contributed to the increase in average and maximum var var as of march declined compared to march as this volatile period in march aged out of the 12month var lookback window partially offset by the normalization of inventory levels in march compared to march truist financial corporation stressed varbased measures stressed var another component of market risk capital is calculated using the same internal models as used for the varbased measure stressed var is calculated over a tenday holding period at a onetail percent confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelvemonth historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the companys trading portfolio the following table summarizes stressed varbased measures table stressed varbased measures day holding period three months ended march  in millions maximum average minimum periodend the increase from the prior year in stressed varbased measures was due to inclusion of volatility levels from march in the 12month stressed var window and normalization of market making inventory levels in march compared to march when inventory levels were lower due to the market volatility specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended march the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and to identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and afs securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity growing core deposits loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs against days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities as of march and december truists liquid asset buffer as a percent of total assets was percent and
