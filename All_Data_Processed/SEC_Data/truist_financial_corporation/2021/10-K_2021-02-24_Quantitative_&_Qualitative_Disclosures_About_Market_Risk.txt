market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists bus interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function truist financial corporation interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities since interest rate changes are out of the control of any private sector institution truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income linear change in prime rate bps prime rate dec dec dec dec up up no change down na down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices truist has established parameters related to interest rate sensitivity measures that prescribe a maximum impact on net interest income under different interest rate scenarios that would result in an escalation to the board the following parameters and interest rate scenarios are considered truists primary measures of interest rate risk maximum impact on net interest income of for the next months assuming a basis point change in interest rates each quarter for four quarters and a maximum impact on net interest income of for an immediate basis point parallel change in rates this interest rate shock analysis is designed to create an outer bound of acceptable interest rate risk management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits consistent with the industry truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company would increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at truist financial corporation table deposit mix sensitivity analysis linear change in rates bps base scenario at december results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at december as presented in the preceding table truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve simulation analysis change in interest rates bps hypothetical percentage change in eve dec dec up no change down truist uses financial instruments including derivatives to manage interest rate risk related to securities commercial loans msrs and mortgage banking operations longterm debt and other funding sources during october truist initiated a new investment securities fair value hedging program using fixed interest rate swaps to hedge prepayable securities truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions on behalf of its clients and as part of associated hedging activities as of december truist had derivative financial instruments outstanding with notional amounts totaling billion with an associated net fair value of billion see note derivative financial instruments for additional disclosures libor in its current form was anticipated to no longer be available after for most tenors of us dollar libor subject to the results of a consultation period ending january the administrator of libor is considering extending publication until june tenors used infrequently by truist including one week and two month us dollar libor are still anticipated to cease publication at december based on this new guidance truist has us dollar liborbased contracts that extend beyond june to prepare for the transition to an alternative reference rate management has formed a crossfunctional project team to address the libor transition the project team has performed an assessment to identify the potential risks related to the transition from libor to a new index the project team provides updates to executive leadership and the board contract fallback language for existing loans and leases is under review and certain contracts will need updated provisions for the transition current fallback language used for new renewed and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations updates to current fallback language will be evaluated according to new regulatory guidance for the extension of timelines for the transition and expectations for production of us dollar libor contracts during truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness for the transition market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition for a further discussion of the various risks associated with the potential cessation of libor and the transition to alternative reference rates refer to the section titled item1a risk factors in truist began offering sofrbased lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients and entered into sofrbased derivative contracts truist expects sofr to become a more commonlyused pricing benchmark across the industry truist continues to evaluate sofr for additional product offerings and other alternative reference rates as replacements for libor market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies procedures and methodologies exist for all covered positions additionally trading positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies procedures and methodologies securitizations as of december the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule was not material consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions prior to the integration of the two institutional broker dealer businesses to form truist securities in the third quarter of truist operated two historical var models and the aggregate companywide var across the systems was determined additively with no benefit of diversification the heritage bbt var model was retired following the formation of truist securities following the formation of truist securities var is calculated on a consolidated basis using the truist var engine for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing profit and loss attribution and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for both the three and twelve months ended december and the increase from the prior year was mainly due to the integration of the heritage suntrust trading business and the market volatility due to the covid19 pandemic as illustrated in the tables below the inclusion of volatility levels observed in march in the month var historic lookback window led to a convergence between var and

pandemic specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model there were seven companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december primarily driven by the covid19 pandemic which led to a sudden and significant repricing of instruments in financial markets during the first and second quarters of as well as an increase in market volatility and deterioration in overall market liquidity in accordance with established policy and procedure all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance following such reviews truist determined that the var model performed in line with expectations and that the significant moves in underlying market risk factors caused by the covid19 pandemic would not typically have been captured within the 1day var measure truist financial corporation model risk management mrm is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mrm policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and to identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for historical repeats and hypothetical risk factor shocks all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of this mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default inability or unwillingness of a borrower obligor or counterparty to meet the terms of any financial obligation to truist or otherwise perform as agreed credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower obligor or counterparty credit risk arises when truist funds are extended committed invested or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements whether on or offbalance sheet credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the bank holds deteriorates truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower establishing a process for credit approval accountability careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower transaction market and collateral risks ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships continuous monitoring of the portfolio market dynamics and the economy and periodically reevaluating the companys strategy and overall exposure as economic market and other relevant conditions change truist financial corporation the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truists lending function underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk therefore proper loan underwriting is critical to truists longterm financial success truists underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific riskmitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truists risk philosophy provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals cash flow and debt service coverage cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrowers cash flow or if not must be justified by secondary repayment sources secondary sources of repayment alternative repayment funds are a significant riskmitigating factor as long as they are liquid can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source value of any underlying collateral loans are generally secured by the asset being financed because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor collateral unless it is liquid does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrowers normal cash flows overall creditworthiness of the client taking into account the clients relationships both past and current with truist and other lenders truists success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients which involves assessing their financial position and background level of equity invested in the transaction in general borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances refer to the lending activities section in this mda for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that i truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding funding liquidity risk or ii truist cannot easily unwind or offset specific exposures without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions market liquidity risk compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws rules or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards this risk exposes truist to fines civil monetary penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk can result in diminished reputation reduced franchise or enterprise value limited business opportunities and lessened expansion potential strategic risk strategic risk is the risk of financial loss diminished

risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs truist uses models for many purposes including the valuation of financial positions estimation of credit losses and the measurement of risk valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available valuation models are also used as inputs for var the estimation of var itself regulatory capital stress testing and the acl models are owned by the applicable bus who are responsible for the development implementation and use of their models oversight of these functions is performed by the mrm which is a component of the rmo once models have been approved model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition industry and economic conditions technological capabilities and other developments mrm manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities the risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers additionally mrm maintains an enterprisewide model inventory containing relevant model information regarding model validation mrm utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development implementation and conceptual soundness on certain occasions the mrm will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts once in a production environment mrm assesses a models performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews mrm tracks issues

subsidiaries advances to subsidiaries dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders retirement of common stock and payments on longterm debt see note parent company financial information for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions therefore truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments debt service common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash inflows truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows in determining the buffer truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to affiliates serving as a source of strength to truist bank and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets at december and december the parent company had months and months respectively of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows and months and months respectively when including the payment of common stock dividends truist bank truist carefully manages liquidity risk at truist bank truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds
