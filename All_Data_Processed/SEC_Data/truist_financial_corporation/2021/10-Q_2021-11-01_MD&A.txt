risk management framework promotes the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite truist has developed and employs a risk taxonomy that further guides business functions in identifying measuring responding to monitoring and reporting on possible exposures to the organization the risk taxonomy drives internal risk conversations and enables truist to clearly and transparently communicate to stakeholders the level of potential risk the company faces both presently and in the future and the companys position on managing risk to acceptable levels truist financial corporation truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys

on form 10k for the year ended december for additional disclosures under the section titled risk management market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk both on its assets and on its liabilities truist actively manages its interest rate risk exposure through the strategic repricing of its assets and liabilities taking into account the volumes maturities and mix with the goal of keeping net interest margin as stable as possible truist primarily uses three methods to measure and monitor its interest rate risk i simulations of possible changes to net interest income over the next two years based on gradual changes in interest rates ii analysis of interest rate shock scenarios and iii analysis of economic value of equity based on changes in interest rates the companys simulation model takes into account assumptions related to prepayment trends using a combination of market data and internal historical experiences for deposits and loans as well as scheduled maturities and payments and the expected outlook for the economy and interest rates these assumptions are reviewed and adjusted monthly to reflect changes in current interest rates compared to the rates applicable to truists assets and liabilities the model also considers truists current and prospective liquidity position current balance sheet volumes and projected growth andor contractions accessibility of funds for shortterm needs and capital maintenance deposit betas are an important assumption in the interest rate risk modeling process truist applies an average deposit beta the sensitivity of deposit rate changes relative to market rate changes of approximately to its nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts when determining its interest rate sensitivity nonmaturity interestbearing deposit accounts include interest checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts that do not have a contractual maturity truist also regularly conducts sensitivity analyses on other key variables including noninterestbearing deposits to determine the impact these variables could have on the companys interest rate risk position the predictive value of the simulation model depends upon the accuracy of the assumptions but management believes that it provides helpful information for the management of interest rate risk truist financial corporation the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on net interest income as projected for the next months assuming a gradual change in interest rates as described below table interest sensitivity simulation analysis interest rate scenario annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income gradual change in prime rate bps prime rate sep sep sep sep up up no change down down the down and rates are floored at one basis point and may not reflect down and basis points for all rate indices rate sensitivity increased compared to prior periods primarily driven by excess liquidity and hedging changes partially offset by an increase in the investment securities portfolio management considers how the interest rate risk position could be impacted by changes in balance sheet mix liquidity in the banking industry has been very strong during the current economic cycle much of this liquidity increase has resulted in growth in noninterestbearing demand deposits consistent with the industry truist has seen a significant increase in this funding source the behavior of these deposits is one of the most important assumptions used in determining the interest rate risk position of truist a decrease in the amount of these deposits in the future would reduce the asset sensitivity of truists balance sheet because the company would increase interestbearing funds to offset the loss of this advantageous funding source the following table shows the results of truists interestrate sensitivity position assuming the loss of demand deposits and an associated increase in managed rate deposits under various scenarios for purposes of this analysis truist modeled the incremental beta of managed rate deposits for the replacement of the demand deposits at table deposit mix sensitivity analysis gradual change in rates bps base scenario at september results assuming a decrease in noninterestbearing demand deposits billion billion up up the base scenario is equal to the annualized hypothetical percentage change in net interest income at september as presented in the preceding table truist also uses an eve analysis to focus on longerterm projected changes in asset and liability values given potential changes in interest rates this measure allows truist to analyze interest rate risk that falls outside the net interest income simulation period the eve model is a discounted cash flow of the portfolio of assets liabilities and derivative instruments the difference in the present value of assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as eve the following table shows the effect that the indicated changes in interest rates would have on eve table eve simulation analysis change in interest rates bps hypothetical percentage change in eve sep sep up no change down truist uses financial instruments

afs securities to reduce marktomarket volatility within aoci and also to increase its overall asset sensitivity position as of september the company had billion of payfixed swaps associated with this hedging program that are accounted for as fair value hedges in the third quarter of this hedging program reduced net interest income by million truist also uses derivatives to facilitate transactions

impacted teammates and provide timely notice to impacted clients current fallback language used for new renewed and modified contracts is generally consistent with arrc recommendations and includes use of hardwired fallback language where appropriate truist continues to manage the impact of these contracts and other financial instruments systems implications hedging strategies and related operational and market risks on established project plans for business and operational readiness for the transition market risks associated with this change are dependent on the alternative reference rates available and market conditions at transition in truist began offering sofrbased lending solutions to wholesale and consumer clients and entered into sofrbased derivative contracts the company

exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are

position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the three and nine months ended september and

corporation specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended september the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months model risk management mrm
