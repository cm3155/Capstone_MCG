market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices effective management of market risk is essential to achieving truists strategic financial objectives truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of effective market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions truist primarily monitors this risk through two measurement types i net interest income at risk and ii economic value of equity and manages this risk with securities derivatives and broader asset liability management activities truist financial corporation net interest income at risk measures changes in net interest income in alternate interest rate scenarios relative to truists baseline scenario which relies on assumptions including expectations of the economy and interest rates which are influenced by market conditions new business volume pricing and client behavior in measuring net interest income at risk truist assumes that changes in key factors such as prepayments and deposit pricing betas largely move in line with those it has experienced in prior rate cycles however future behavior of key factors used in this measurement may vary net interest income at risk measurement assumes when applicable that us interest rates will not fall below zero truist evaluates a wide range of alternate scenarios including instantaneous and gradual as well as parallel and nonparallel changes in interest rates the following table provides additional information on the estimated change to net interest income over the following months for select parallel alternate scenarios expressed as a percentage change relative to baseline net interest income table interest sensitivity simulation analysis dec up 200bps gradual change in interest rates up 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates down 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates down 200bps gradual change in interest rates estimated changes to net interest income in the previous table assume no change in deposit balances or mix relative to the baseline scenario in an increasing rate scenario rotation from noninterestbearing into interest bearing deposits would reduce net interest income conversely in a down rate scenario rotation from higher yielding to lower yielding deposits would benefit net interest income truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of deposit and other key assumptions used in interest rate risk economic value of equity measures changes in economic value of truists current balance sheet and offbalance sheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios relative to starting economic value truist uses economic value of equity as a longerterm measure of interest rate risk libor transition the remaining tenors of us dollar libor ceased publication of representative rates on june with only select tenors receiving a synthetic publication through september truist provided timely notices and information to impacted clients about the transition to new interest rates post cessation and had minimal use of synthetic libor to support the transition most contracts were transitioned to new rates in july and august in accordance with fallback language a small number of contracts utilize longer tenor libor rates and will transition by early 6month and 12month libor based on contractual agreements truist has materially completed libor transition efforts primarily utilizing sofr replacement rates and closed formal project efforts as of september fallback language used to remediate loan agreements was generally consistent with arrc recommendations and included use of hardwired fallback language which transitioned loans to a sofr based rate after june for a small number of wholesale contracts remaining without fallback language truist leveraged the libor act and corresponding safe harbor provision to transition these loans to sofr truists consumer lending portfolios included fallback language to transition to sofr based on lender discretion and as supported by the libor act therefore these contracts did not require remediation and also benefit from the safe harbor provisions of the libor act derivatives that reference libor transitioned to a sofrbased replacement rate as set forth in the isda protocol addressing libor fallbacks between the company and its counterparties which have adhered to the protocol through bilateral amendments between the company and each of its counterparties or as established under the libor act and rules promulgated thereunder by the frb fallback language used to remediate libor based derivatives was generally consistent with isda publications the companys preferred securities and the companys and truist banks floating rate notes that reference libor transitioned to a sofr based rate utilizing application of the libor act and the rules promulgated thereunder by the frb truist announced that these securities would move to a month adjusted term sofr in accordance with the libor act see note shareholders equity for information about preferred stock using libor market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a comprehensive risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level which is intended to ensure that exposures are in line with truists risk appetite truist financial corporation truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies securitizations as of december the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule which were nonagency asset backed securities positions was million consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including but not limited to deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of december varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to actively manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table summarizes certain varbased measures for the months ended december and truist financial corporation table varbased measures year ended december  in millions 10day

the varbased measure stressed var is calculated over a tenday holding period at a onetail confidence level and employs a historical simulation approach based on a continuous twelvemonth historical window selected to reflect a period of significant financial stress for the companys trading portfolio the following table summarizes stressed varbased measures table stressed varbased measures day holding period year ended december  in millions maximum average minimum periodend compared to the prior year stressed var measures were generally higher primarily due to higher market making inventory and lower diversification benefits in specific risk measures specific risk is a measure of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended december the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk oversight mro is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision tools and models including trading market risk models the validation activities are conducted in accordance with mro policy which incorporates regulatory guidance related to the evaluation of model conceptual soundness ongoing monitoring and outcomes analysis as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models are reviewed regularly to preemptively address emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a comprehensive range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for risk factor sensitivities historical repeats and hypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity horizons of key risk factors all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys comprehensive stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios on an ongoing basis and makes updates as necessary which is intended to ensure that both current and emerging risks are captured appropriately management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy credit risk credit risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from the default unwillingness or inability of a borrower obligor or counterparty such that an obligation will not be repaid on time andor in full or the client andor counterparty will fail to perform on an obligation to the company or its affiliates credit risk exists in all activities where success depends on the performance of a borrower obligor or counterparty credit risk arises when truist funds are extended committed invested or otherwise exposed through actual or implied contractual agreements whether on or offbalance sheet credit risk increases when the credit quality of an issuer whose securities or other instruments the company or its affiliates holds has deteriorated truist has established the following general practices to manage credit risk limiting the amount of credit that individual lenders may extend to a borrower establishing a process for credit approval accountability careful initial underwriting and analysis of borrower transaction market and collateral risks ongoing servicing and monitoring of individual loans and lending relationships maintaining collections and asset resolution teams truist financial corporation continuous monitoring of the portfolio concentration and transactional limits emerging risks market dynamics and the economy and periodically reevaluating the companys strategy and overall exposure as economic market and other relevant conditions change the following discussion describes the underwriting procedures and overall risk management of truists lending function underwriting approach the loan portfolio is a primary source of profitability and risk therefore proper loan underwriting is critical to truists longterm financial success truists underwriting approach is designed to define acceptable combinations of specific riskmitigating features that promote credit relationships that conform to truists risk philosophy provided below is a summary of the most significant underwriting criteria used to evaluate new loans and loan renewals cash flow and debt service coverage cash flow adequacy is a necessary condition of creditworthiness meaning that loans must either be clearly supported by a borrowers cash flow or if not must be justified by secondary repayment sources secondary sources of repayment alternative repayment funds are a significant riskmitigating factor as long as they are liquid can be easily accessed and provide adequate resources to supplement the primary cash flow source value of any underlying collateral loans are generally secured by the asset being financed because an analysis of the primary and secondary sources of repayment is the most important factor collateral unless it is liquid does not justify loans that cannot be serviced by the borrowers normal cash flows overall creditworthiness of the client taking into account the clients relationships both past and current with truist and other lenders truists success depends on building lasting and mutually beneficial relationships with clients which involves assessing their financial position and background level of equity invested in the transaction in general borrowers are required to contribute or invest a portion of their own funds prior to any loan advances refer to the lending activities section in mda for a discussion of each loan and lease portfolio liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that i truist will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to obtain adequate funding funding liquidity risk or ii truist cannot easily monetize assets without significantly lowering market prices because of inadequate market depth or market disruptions market liquidity risk refer to the liquidity section in mda for additional discussion technology risk technology risk is the business risk associated with the use ownership operation involvement influence and adoption of information technology across the company truist has defined and adopted a technology risk framework that provides the foundation for technology risk strategy program and oversight and defines key objectives operating model components risk domains and capabilities to manage this risk cybersecurity risk management and strategy like other financial services firms truist faces an increasingly complex and evolving cybersecurity threat environment see

anticipated cyber threats these exercises are designed to assess the viability of truists crisis response and management programs and provide the basis for continuous improvement where a potential cybersecurity threat is identified in our environment our cyber incident response team evaluates the potential impact to truist and coordinates remediation where required our cyber incident response team also manages significant cyberspecific events with escalation to executive management and the board as appropriate our cybersecurity framework is also designed to help oversee identify and mitigate cybersecurity risks associated with our use of thirdparty service providers following an initial assessment of the level of enterprise risk potentially posed by use of the thirdparty the service provider is then subject to further riskbased assessments on its operational resilience and cybersecurity practices including disaster recovery and business continuity plans that specify the time frame to resume activities and recover data in its agreements with thirdparty service providers truist then requires service providers to adhere to truists relevant cybersecurity and operational resilience standards subject to certain exceptions that are managed on a casebycase basis our cybersecurity framework is routinely assessed to ensure the effectiveness of key controls through thirdparty cybersecurity maturity measurements technology risk oversight compliance risk management testing and monitoring internal audit review and regulatory oversight in addition truist continues to strengthen its crossfunctional holistic approach to enterprise resilience by addressing potential amplification of risks from significant technology cybersecurity and data incidents as part of these efforts truist is deepening capabilities for both disaster recovery and restoration along with the implementation of other resilience measures managements role in assessing and managing material risks from cybersecurity threats truists cybersecurity framework is operated and maintained by management including the cio ciso cro and ctro these senior officers are responsible for assessing and managing truists cybersecurity risks our cybersecurity framework strategy which is overseen by ciso is informed by various risk and control assessments control testing external assessments threat intelligence and public and private information sharing our cybersecurity framework also includes processes for escalating and considering the materiality of incidents that impact truist including

strategic regulatory and compliance purposes management and the board provide oversight of the data risk management program and receive regular updates from the chief data risk officer while the current data risk management program identifies and mitigates data risk the data risk program must be dynamic and is actively expanding oversight to enhance data risk management capabilities to achieve the data risk management objectives defined in the strategic plan compliance risk compliance risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from violations of laws rules or regulations or from nonconformance with prescribed practices internal policies and procedures or ethical standards this risk exposes truist to fines civil monetary penalties payment of damages and the voiding of contracts compliance risk can result in diminished reputation reduced franchise or enterprise value limited business opportunities increased costs and expenses and lessened

internal and external stakeholders including clients teammates investors regulators and communities operational risk operational risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from inadequate or failed internal processes people and systems or from external events it includes legal risk which is the risk of loss arising from defective transactions litigation or claims made or the failure to adequately protect companyowned assets an operational loss occurs when an event results in a loss or reserve originating from operational risk model risk model risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital from decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs truist uses models for many purposes including the valuation of financial positions estimation of credit losses and the measurement of risk valuation models are used to value certain financial instruments for which quoted prices may not be readily available valuation models are also used as inputs for var the estimation of var itself regulatory capital stress testing and the acl models are owned by the applicable bus who are responsible for the development implementation and use of their models oversight of these functions is performed by the mro which is a component of the rmo once models have been approved model owners are responsible for the maintenance of an appropriate operating environment and must monitor and evaluate the performance of the models on a recurring basis models are updated in response to changes in portfolio composition industry and economic conditions technological capabilities and other developments mro manages model risk in a holistic manner through a suite of model governance and model validation activities the risk of each model is assessed and classified into various risk tiers additionally mro maintains an enterprisewide model inventory containing relevant model information regarding model validation mro utilizes internal validation analysts and managers with skill sets in predictive modeling to perform detailed reviews of model development implementation and conceptual soundness on certain occasions the mro will also engage external parties to assist with validation efforts once in a production environment mro assesses a models performance on a periodic basis through ongoing monitoring reviews mro tracks issues that have been identified during model validation or through ongoing monitoring and engages with model owners to ensure their timely remediation mro gauges model risk utilizing a collection of key risk indicators which are periodically reported to relevant committees including but not limited to the model risk management committee and the erc mro will also present model risk topics to the board risk committee as necessary liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and afs securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity growing core deposits loan repayment and the ability to securitize or package loans for sale truist monitors the ability to meet client demand for funds under both normal and stressed market conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs against days of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank to ensure a strong liquidity position and compliance with regulatory requirements management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities truist financial corporation internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is designed to ensure that truist and truist bank have sufficient liquidity for a variety of institutionspecific and marketwide adverse scenarios each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition contractual maturities reductions in unsecured and secured funding and increased draws on unfunded commitments to mitigate liquidity outflows truist has identified sources of liquidity however access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is sufficient to meet the projected net stressed cashflow needs and maintain compliance with regulatory requirements the liquidity buffer consists of unencumbered highly liquid assets and truists liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to ensure that liquidity sources are sufficient to meet ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction lcr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient to meet its estimated total net cash outflows over a prospective calendarday period of stress eligible hqla for purposes of calculating the lcr is the amount of unencumbered hqla that satisfy operational requirements of the lcr rule truist and truist bank are subject to the category iii reduced lcr requirements truist held average weighted eligible hqla of billion and truists average lcr was for the three months ended december effective july truist became subject to final rules implementing the nsfr which are designed to ensure that banking organizations maintain a stable longterm funding profile in relation to their asset composition and offbalance sheet activities at december truist was compliant with this requirement sources of funds management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truists on and offbalance sheet obligations truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits secured and unsecured capital markets funding and shareholders equity truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds markets and retail brokered cds truist bank also maintains access to secured borrowing sources including fhlb advances repurchase agreements and the frb discount window available investment securities could be pledged to create additional secured borrowing capacity the following table presents a summary of truist banks available secured borrowing capacity and eligible cash at the frb table selected liquidity sources dollars in millions dec dec unused borrowing capacity frb fhlb available investment securities after haircuts available secured borrowing capacity eligible cash at the frb total at december truist banks available secured borrowing capacity represented approximately times the amount of wholesale funding maturities in oneyear or less truist additionally has the ability to increase sources of funding by pledging available investment securities to receive the par value of the collateral under the frb bank term funding program truist financial corporation parent company the parent company serves as the primary source of capital for the operating subsidiaries the parent companys assets consist primarily of cash on deposit with truist bank equity investments in subsidiaries advances to subsidiaries and notes receivable from subsidiaries the principal obligations of the parent company are payments on longterm debt the main sources of funds for the parent company are dividends and management fees from subsidiaries repayments of advances to subsidiaries and proceeds from the issuance of equity and longterm debt the primary uses of funds by the parent company are investments in subsidiaries advances to subsidiaries dividend payments to common and preferred shareholders repurchases of common stock and payments on and from timetotime potential repurchases or redemptions of a portion of an outstanding tranche of the longterm debt of the parent company as may be permitted by the terms of each respective series see note parent company financial information for additional information regarding dividends from subsidiaries and debt transactions access to funding at the parent company is more sensitive to market disruptions therefore truist prudently manages cash levels at the parent company to cover a minimum of one year of projected cash outflows which includes unfunded external commitments debt service common and preferred dividends and scheduled debt maturities without the benefit of any new cash inflows truist maintains a significant buffer above the projected one year of cash outflows in determining the buffer truist considers cash requirements for common and preferred dividends unfunded commitments to affiliates serving as a source of strength to truist bank and being able to withstand sustained market disruptions that could limit access to the capital markets at december and december the parent company had months and months respectively of cash on hand to satisfy projected cash outflows and months and months respectively when including the payment of common stock dividends credit ratings credit ratings are forwardlooking opinions of rating agencies as to the companys ability to meet its financial commitments and repay its securities and obligations in accordance with their terms of issuance credit ratings influence both borrowing costs and access to the capital markets the companys credit ratings are continuously monitored by the rating agencies and are subject to change at any time as truist seeks to maintain highquality credit ratings management meets with the major rating agencies on a regular basis to provide financial and

goods or services that are enforceable and legally binding many of the purchase obligations have terms that are not fixed and determinable and are included in the total amount of obligations based upon the estimated timing and amount of payment in addition certain of the purchase agreements contain clauses that would allow truist to cancel the agreement with specified notice however that impact is not included in determining the total amount of obligations see note other assets and liabilities note borrowings and note commitments and contingencies for additional information regarding outstanding balances of sources of liquidity and contractual commitments and obligations capital the maintenance of appropriate levels of capital is a management priority and is monitored on a regular basis truists principal goals related to the maintenance of capital are to provide adequate capital to support truists risk profile consistent with the boardapproved risk appetite provide financial flexibility to support future growth and client needs comply with relevant laws regulations and supervisory guidance achieve optimal credit ratings for truist and its subsidiaries remain a source of strength for its subsidiaries and provide a competitive return to shareholders riskbased capital ratios which include cet1 capital tier capital and total capital are calculated based on regulatory guidance related to the measurement of capital and riskweighted assets truist financial corporation truist regularly performs stress testing on its capital levels and is required to periodically submit the companys capital plans and stress testing results to the banking regulators management regularly monitors the capital position of truist on both a consolidated and banklevel basis in this regard managements objective is to maintain capital at levels that are in excess of internal capital limits which are above the regulatory wellcapitalized minimums management has implemented internal stress capital ratio minimums to evaluate whether capital ratios calculated after the effect of alternative capital actions are likely to remain above internal minimums breaches of internal stressed minimums prompt a review of the planned capital actions included in truists capital plan table capital requirements minimum capital wellcapitalized minimum capital plus truist truist bank stress

received in the ccar process is effective from october to september payments of cash dividends and repurchases of common shares are the methods used to manage any excess capital generated in addition management closely monitors the parent companys double leverage ratio investments in subsidiaries as a percentage of shareholders equity the active management of the subsidiaries equity capital is the process used to manage this important driver of parent company liquidity and is a key element in the management of truists capital position management intends to maintain capital at truist bank at levels that exceed the minimum capital plus ccb this will also result in truist bank being wellcapitalized for regulatory purposes secondarily it is managements intent to maintain truist banks capital at levels that result in regulatory riskbased capital ratios that are generally comparable with peers of similar size complexity and risk profile if the capital levels of truist bank increase above these guidelines excess capital may be transferred to the parent company in the form of special dividend payments subject to regulatory and other operating considerations managements capital

information to conform to the current presentation such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported shareholders equity or net income refer to note basis of presentation for additional discussion regarding reclassifications critical accounting policies the accounting and reporting policies of truist are in accordance with gaap and conform to the accounting and reporting guidelines prescribed by bank regulatory authorities the financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses different assumptions in the application of these policies could result in material changes in the consolidated financial position andor consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding truists accounting policies is fundamental to understanding the consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly truists significant accounting policies and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in detail in note basis of presentation the following is a summary of truists critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments these critical accounting policies are reviewed with the audit committee of the board of directors on a periodic basis acl truists acl represents managements best estimate of expected future credit losses related to the loan and lease portfolios and offbalance sheet lending commitments at the balance sheet date estimates of expected future loan and lease losses are determined by using statistical models and managements judgement the acl estimation process includes both quantitatively calculated components as well as qualitative components quantitative models are designed to forecast probability of default exposure at default and loss given default by correlating certain macroeconomic forecast data to historical experience the models are generally applied at the portfolio level to pools of loans with similar risk characteristics certain loans or leases that do not have similar risk characteristics are individually evaluated when establishing an allowance for expected credit losses the macroeconomic forecast data used in the models is based on forecasted variables for the reasonable and supportable period of two years beyond this forecast period the models gradually revert to longterm historical loss conditions over a oneyear period as a means of addressing uncertainty related to future economic conditions the quantitative allowance components include an adjustment that reflects model outputs calculated using a range of potential future economic conditions expected losses are estimated through contractual maturity giving appropriate consideration to expected prepayments unless the borrower has a right to renew that is not cancellable or to capture the losses expected at the balance sheet date or prior to january it is reasonably expected that the loan will be modified as a tdr the qualitative components of the acl incorporate managements judgment in determining qualitative adjustments where model outputs are inconsistent with managements expectations with respect to expected credit losses the qualitative components are used to adjust for limitations in modeled results related to current economic conditions and considerations with respect to the impact of current and expected events or risks the outcomes of which are uncertain and may not be completely considered by quantitative models management considers a range of macroeconomic forecast data in connection with the allowance estimation process under the range of scenarios considered as of december use of the companys pessimistic scenario would have resulted in an increase to the modeled allowance results of approximately billion this estimate reflects the sensitivity of the modeled allowance estimate to macroeconomic forecast data but does not consider other qualitative adjustments that could increase or decrease modeled loss estimates calculated using this alternative economic scenario the company individually evaluates expected credits losses related to loans and leases that do not share similar risk characteristics and prior to january loans that have been classified as a tdr for individually evaluated loans the alll is determined through review of data specific to the borrower and related collateral if any while prior to january for tdrs default expectations and estimated prepayment speeds that are specific to each of the restructured loan populations are incorporated in the determination of the alll the methodology used to determine an estimate for the rufc is similar to that used to determine the funded component of the alll and is measured over the period there is a contractual obligation to extend credit that is not unconditionally cancellable the rufc is adjusted for factors specific to binding commitments including the probability of funding and exposure at default a detailed discussion of the methodology used in determining the acl is included in note basis of presentation truist financial corporation fair value of financial instruments the vast majority of assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis are based on either quoted market prices or market prices for similar instruments refer to note fair value disclosures for additional disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments and note business combinations divestitures and noncontrolling interests for additional disclosures regarding business combinations securities truist generally utilizes a thirdparty pricing service in determining the fair value of its afs investment securities whereas trading securities are priced internally fair value measurements for investment securities are derived from marketbased pricing matrices that were developed using observable inputs that include benchmark yields benchmark securities reported trades offers bids issuer spreads and broker quotes management performs procedures to evaluate the fair values provided by the thirdparty service provider these procedures which are performed independent of the responsible business unit include comparison of pricing information received from the thirdparty pricing service to other thirdparty pricing sources review of additional information provided by the thirdparty pricing service and other thirdparty sources for selected securities and backtesting to compare the price realized on security sales to the daily pricing information received from the thirdparty pricing service the enterprise valuation committee which provides oversight to truists enterprisewide ipv function is responsible for the comparison of pricing information received from the thirdparty pricing service or internally to other thirdparty pricing sources approving tolerance limits determined by ipv for price comparison exceptions reviewing significant changes to pricing and valuation policies and reviewing and approving the pricing decisions made on any illiquid and hardtoprice securities when market observable data is not available which generally occurs due to the lack of liquidity or inactive markets for certain securities the valuation of the security is subjective and may involve substantial judgment by management to reflect unobservable input assumptions msrs truists primary class of msrs for which it separately manages the economic risks relates to residential mortgages residential msrs do not trade in an active open market with readily observable prices while sales of msrs do occur the precise terms and conditions typically are not readily available accordingly truist estimates the fair value of residential msrs using a stochastic oas valuation model to project residential msr cash flows over multiple interest rate scenarios which are then discounted at riskadjusted rates the oas model considers portfolio characteristics contractually specified servicing fees prepayment assumptions delinquency rates late charges other ancillary revenue costs to service and other economic factors truist reassesses and periodically adjusts the underlying inputs and assumptions in the oas model to reflect market conditions and assumptions that a market participant would consider in valuing the residential msr asset fair value estimates and assumptions are compared to industry surveys recent market activity actual portfolio experience and when available observable market data due to the nature of the valuation inputs residential msrs are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy the value of residential msrs is significantly affected by mortgage interest rates available in the marketplace which influence mortgage loan prepayment speeds in general during periods of declining interest rates the value of msrs declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgagerefinance activity conversely during periods of rising interest rates the value of residential msrs generally increases due to reduced refinance activity truist typically hedges against market value changes in the residential msrs refer to note loan servicing for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in managements assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs lhfs truist originates certain residential and commercial mortgage loans for sale to investors that are measured at fair value the fair value is primarily based on quoted market prices for securities backed by similar types of loans changes in the fair value are recorded as components of mortgage banking income while the related origination costs are generally recognized in personnel expense when incurred the changes in fair value are largely driven by changes in interest rates subsequent to loan funding and changes in the fair value of servicing associated with the lhfs truist uses various derivative instruments to mitigate the economic effect of changes in fair value of the underlying loans lhfs also includes certain loans generally carried at locom where management has committed to a formal plan of sale and the loans are available for immediate sale adjustments to reflect unrealized gains and losses resulting from changes in fair value up to the original carrying amount and realized gains and losses upon ultimate sale are classified as noninterest income the fair value of these loans is estimated using observable market prices when available when observable market prices are not available the company uses judgment and estimates fair value using internal models that reflect assumptions consistent with those that would be used by a market participant in estimating fair value refer to note basis of presentation for further description of the companys accounting for lhfs truist financial corporation trading loans truist elects to measure certain loans at fair value for financial reporting where fair value aligns with the underlying business purpose specifically loans included within this classification include trading loans that are i purchased in connection with the companys trs business ii part of the loan sales and trading business within the ccb segment or iii backed by the sba refer to note commitments and contingencies and note derivative financial instruments for further discussion of the companys trs business the loans purchased in connection with the companys trs and sales and trading businesses are primarily commercial and corporate leveraged loans valued based on quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active by a thirdparty pricing service sba loans are fully guaranteed by the us government as to contractual principal and interest and there is sufficient observable trading activity upon which to base the estimate of fair value derivative assets and liabilities truist uses derivatives to manage various financial risks and in a dealer capacity to facilitate client transactions truist mitigates credit risk by subjecting counterparties to credit reviews and approvals similar to those used in making loans and other extensions of credit in addition certain counterparties are required to provide collateral to truist when their unsecured loss positions exceed certain negotiated limits the fair values of derivative financial instruments are determined based on quoted market prices and internal pricing models that use market observable data for interest rates foreign exchange equity and credit the fair value of interest rate lock commitments which are related to mortgage loan commitments is based on quoted market prices adjusted for commitments that truist does not expect to fund and includes the value attributable to the net servicing fee refer to note derivative financial instruments for further information on the companys derivatives goodwill and other intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations are recorded at their fair values this often involves estimates based on thirdparty valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques which are inherently subjective the amortization of definitelived intangible assets is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received which is also subjective business combinations also typically result in goodwill which is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests based on the fair values of the reporting units to which the acquired goodwill relates refer to note basis of presentation for a description of the impairment testing process at december truists reporting units with goodwill balances were cbw ccb and ih management performs a goodwill impairment analysis on an annual basis as of october or more often if events or circumstances indicate that it is morelikelythan not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying value for its annual impairment review truist performed a quantitative test of each of its reporting units the quantitative impairment test estimates the fair value of the reporting units using the income approach and a marketbased approach weighted and respectively the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows discount rates and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multiyear financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin expected credit losses noninterest income noninterest expense and required capital the market based approach utilizes comparable public company information key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit and guideline transactions when applicable truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies historic bank control premiums and the current market the projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the cbw and ccb reporting units the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was as of october based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit the discount rates utilized for the cbw ccb and ih reporting units as of october were and respectively truist financial corporation based on the companys annual impairment test of goodwill it was determined for the cbw and ccb reporting units that the respective reporting units carrying value was in excess of its respective fair value as of october resulting in a noncash nontaxdeductible goodwill impairment charge of billion for the year ended december the goodwill impairment was primarily due to the continued impact of higher interest rates and discount rates on the cbw and ccb reporting units and a sustained decline in banking industry share prices including truists for the ih reporting unit it was determined that the reporting units fair value was in excess of its respective carrying value as of october the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is highly sensitive to changes in managements estimates and assumptions therefore in some instances changes in these assumptions could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than its carrying value circumstances that could negatively impact the fair value of truists reporting units in the future include a sustained decrease in truists stock price continued decline in industry peer multiples an increase in the applicable discount rate and further deterioration in the reporting units forecasts additionally a reporting units carrying value could change based on market conditions change in the underlying makeup of the reporting unit or the risk profile of those reporting units which could impact whether the fair value of a reporting unit is less than carrying value the company monitored events and circumstances during the period from october through december including macroeconomic and market factors industry and banking sector events truist specific performance indicators a comparison of managements forecast and assumptions to those used in its october quantitative impairment test and the sensitivity of the october quantitative test results to changes in assumptions through december based on these considerations management concluded that it was not morelikelythannot that the fair value of one or more of its reporting units is below its respective carrying amount as of december income taxes truist is subject to income tax laws of the us its states and the municipalities in which the company conducts business in estimating the net amount due to or to be received from tax jurisdictions either currently or in the future the company assesses the appropriate tax treatment of transactions and filing positions after considering statutes regulations judicial precedent and other pertinent information the income tax laws are complex and subject to different interpretations by the taxpayer and the relevant government taxing authorities significant judgment is required in determining the tax accruals and in evaluating the companys tax positions including evaluating uncertain tax positions changes in the estimate of accrued taxes occur periodically due to changes in tax rates interpretations of tax laws and new judicial guidance the status of examinations by the tax authorities and newly enacted statutory and regulatory guidance that could impact the relative merits and risks of tax positions these changes when they occur impact tax expense and can materially affect operating results truist reviews tax positions quarterly and adjusts accrued taxes as new information becomes available deferred income tax assets represent amounts available to reduce income taxes payable in future years such assets arise due to temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities as well as from nol and tax credit carryforwards the company regularly evaluates the ability to realize dtas recognizing a valuation allowance if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the dta will not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary the company considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws as well as estimates of future pretax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented truist currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards for additional income tax information refer to note basis of presentation and note income taxes pension and postretirement benefit obligations truist offers various pension plans and postretirement benefit plans to teammates calculation of the obligations and related expenses under these plans requires the use of actuarial valuation methods and assumptions which are subject to management judgment and may differ significantly if different assumptions are used the discount rate assumption used to measure the postretirement benefit obligations is set by reference to an aa above median corporate bond yield curve and the individual characteristics of the plans such as projected cash flow patterns and payment durations management also considered the sensitivity that changes in the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate would have on pension expense for the companys qualified plans a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would result in additional pension expense of approximately million for while a decrease of basis points in the expected return on plan assets would result in an increase of approximately million in pension expense for this estimate reflects the sensitivity of certain factors considered in calculation of pension expense but does not consider all factors that could increase or decrease estimates calculated refer to note benefit plans for disclosures related to the benefit plans truist financial corporation
