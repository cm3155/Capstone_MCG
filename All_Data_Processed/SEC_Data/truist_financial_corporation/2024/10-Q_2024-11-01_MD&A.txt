estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december the special assessment for truist is million with million recognized in the fourth quarter of and additional adjustments of million recognized for

additional two quarters beyond the initial eight quarterly installments the special assessment will be paid in ten quarterly installments which began in the second quarter of the ultimate amount of expenses associated with the special assessment will also be impacted by the finalization of the losses incurred by the fdic in the resolutions of silicon valley bank and signature bank which could result in additional expense in june the fdic adopted a final rule that significantly modified the required frequency and informational content of resolution plan submissions applicable to insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets idi resolution plans as a result of the rule truist bank is required to submit to the fdic a full idi resolution plan every three years and an interim supplement in the years in which a full idi resolution plan is not due the final rule introduces a new credibility standard for evaluating the adequacy of idi resolution plan submissions including increased engagement and capabilities testing the contours of the fdics application of this new credibility standard remain to be seen and may require the exercise of a meaningful degree of judgment by the fdic a failure by truist bank to satisfy the credibility standard or any other provision of the rule may cause the fdic to require truist bank to reconsider portions of its idi resolution plan or result in an enforcement action by the fdic the final rule was effective october truist banks first interim supplement is due july and its full idi resolution plan submission is due july in august the fdic and the frb issued final joint guidance regarding resolution plans submitted by large bank holding companies 165d resolution plans truist as a domestic triennial full filer is

required to reflect the firms business operations and interconnectedness and support the goal of substantially mitigating serious adverse effects on the financial stability of the united states in the event of the firms failure the agencies have proposed a rule requiring large bank holding companies to issue longterm debt that would serve as prepositioned resolution resources in the event of a firms failure when finalized and implemented the longterm debt rule may impact truists 165d resolution plan strategy truist financial corporation in july the fdic released a proposed rule to amend its regulations under the change in bank control act which generally provides that no person may directly or indirectly acquire control of an insured depository institution unless the person has given the appropriate federal banking agency prior notice of the proposed transaction and the agency has not disapproved it the fdics regulations contain a rebuttable presumption that the acquisition of voting securities of a holding company like truist that directly or indirectly controls an insured state nonmember bank like truist bank constitutes such an acquisition of control requiring prior notice to the fdic if immediately after the transaction the acquiring person will own control or hold with power to vote percent or more of any class of voting securities of the holding company and other specified conditions are met the proposed rule removes an explicit exemption for transactions where the frb reviews a notice under the change in bank control act in addition the fdic seeks information and comment about its approach in response to these notices including the role played by asset managers and other institutional investors with fdicsupervised institutions we continue to evaluate this proposal and its potential impacts if adopted as proposed on the company and truist bank in september the fdic adopted a final statement of policy regarding its review of bank merger act applications the final policy statement addresses among other things the scope of transactions subject to fdic approval a more rigorous fdic process for evaluating bank merger act applications and the fdic boards heightened expectations with respect to the bank merger acts statutory factors as a result bank merger act applications to the fdic will now require additional information and transactions that would result in a bank with billion or more in total consolidated assets will be subject to heightened scrutiny as a result this new policy and heightened scrutiny will impact any merger transaction in which truist bank is involved in october the cfpb finalized a rule under the doddfrank act which requires certain entities including truist and truist bank to among other things make available to a consumer upon request information in its control or possession concerning the consumer financial product or service that the consumer obtained from that entity the rule also requires data providers holding a consumer account such as truist bank to establish a developer interface satisfying certain data security specifications and other standards through which the data provider can receive requests for and provide specific types of data covered by the rule in electronic usable form to authorized third parties including data aggregators data providers are prohibited from charging consumers or third parties fees for processing these consumer data requests the rule also places certain data security authorization and other obligations on third parties accessing covered data from data providers which could include truist and truist bank when acting in certain capacities the rule requires third parties to limit their collection use and retention of the data received to only what is reasonably necessary to provide the consumers requested product or service including uses that are reasonably necessary to improve the product or service the compliance date for a data provider that is a depository institution with over billion in total assets is april however the final rule is subject to ongoing litigation that could impact whether and when truist and truist bank are required to comply with the rule we continue to evaluate the final rule and the potential impacts on the company executive overview in the third quarter of we made considerable progress on driving

management framework supported by people processes and systems to identify measure monitor manage and report significant risks arising from its exposures and business activities a key objective of the companys risk management framework is to promote the execution of business strategies and objectives in alignment with its risk appetite truist has developed a risk taxonomy designed to facilitate internal risk measurement and monitoring and help the business lines and enterprise functions assess the level of potential risk generated by their activities truist is committed to fostering a culture that supports identification and escalation of risks across the organization all teammates are responsible for upholding the companys purpose mission and values and are encouraged to speak up if there is any activity or behavior that is inconsistent with the companys culture the truist code of ethics guides the companys decision making and informs teammates on how to act in the absence of specific guidance truist seeks an appropriate return for the risk taken in its business operations risktaking activities must be evaluated and prioritized to identify those that present attractive riskadjusted returns while preserving asset value and capital truists compensation plans are designed to consider teammates adherence to and successful implementation of truists risk values and associated policies and procedures the companys compensation structure is designed to support its core values and sound risk management practices in an effort to promote judicious risktaking behavior market risk market risk is the risk to current or anticipated earnings capital or economic value arising from changes in the market value of portfolios securities or other financial instruments market risk results from changes in the level volatility or correlations among financial market risk factors or prices including interest rates credit spreads foreign exchange rates equity and commodity prices truists most significant market risk exposure is to interest rate risk in its balance sheet however market risk also results from underlying product liquidity risk price risk and volatility risk in truists business units interest rate risk results from differences between the timing of rate changes and the timing of cash flows associated with assets and liabilities repricing risk from changing rate relationships among different yield curves affecting bank activities basis risk from changing rate relationships across the spectrum of maturities yield curve risk and from interestrelated options inherently embedded in bank products options risk the primary objectives of market risk management are to minimize adverse effects from changes in market risk factors on net interest income net income and capital and to offset the risk of price changes for certain assets and liabilities recorded at fair value at truist market risk management also includes the enterprisewide ipv function interest rate market risk as a financial institution truist is exposed to interest rate risk from assets liabilities and offbalance sheet positions truist primarily monitors this risk through two measurement types i nii at risk and ii economic value of equity and manages this risk with securities derivatives and broader asset liability management activities irr measurement is reported monthly through the alco monthly irr reporting includes exposure and historical trends relative to risk limit scenarios impacts to a wide range of rate scenarios and sensitivity tests of key assumptions irr reporting is provided to the brc monthly and reviews of varying irr topics are performed quarterly irr measurement is influenced by data assumptions and models due to their high sensitivity to market rates mortgage loan and security prepayments leverage an industry model that results in varying prepayment speeds across rate scenarios prepayments for nonmortgage loans leverage a mix of dynamic models and static prepayment assumptions based on historical experience interestbearingdeposit rate paid is projected to move at a ratio deposit beta of market rates primarily the federal funds rate aligned to historical experience truist uses derivatives to hedge interest income variability of floating rate loans and to hedge valuation changes of longterm debt and investment securities truist financial corporation nii at risk measures the change in nii under alternate interest rate scenarios relative to truists baseline scenario which incorporates truists current balance sheet and offbalance sheet hedges as well as expectations for new business over the forecast horizon truists baseline scenario relies on assumptions including expectations of the economy and interest rates which are influenced by market conditions new business volume pricing and customer behavior in measuring nii at risk truist assumes that changes in key factors such as prepayments and deposit pricing betas largely move in line with those it has experienced in prior rate cycles however future behavior of key factors may vary from those used in this measurement nii at risk measurement assumes when applicable that us interest rates floor at zero and truist does not take any balance sheet or hedging actions in response to the rate scenarios truist evaluates a wide range of alternate scenarios including instantaneous and gradual as well as parallel and nonparallel changes in interest rates the table below presents the estimated change to nii over the following months for select parallel alternate scenarios expressed as a percentage change relative to baseline nii table interest sensitivity simulation analysis sep dec up 200bps gradual change in interest rates up 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates down 50bps instantaneous change in interest rates down 200bps gradual change in interest rates estimated changes to nii in the table above assume no change in deposit balances or mix relative to the baseline scenario in increasing interest rate scenarios rotation from noninterestbearing into interest bearing deposits would reduce nii conversely in decreasing interest rate scenarios rotation from higher yielding to lower yielding deposits would benefit net interest income truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of deposit and other key assumptions used in nii risk including asset prepayment speeds new loan volume pricing spreads interestbearing deposit betas noninterestbearing demand deposit balance runoff replaced by market funding eve measures changes in the economic value of truists current balance sheet and offbalance sheet hedges under alternate rate scenarios relative to starting economic value truist uses eve as a longerterm measure of interest rate risk truist performs and monitors sensitivity tests of key assumptions used in eve including asset prepayment speeds mortgage spreads mortgage loan and security valuations interestbearing deposit beta deposit runoff decay key assumption tests are generally performed by increasing and decreasing the assumption whether static or dynamically modeled relative to their respective starting values and then measuring the resulting impact to nii and eve under baseline and alternate rate scenarios the identification and testing of key assumptions are influenced by market conditions and management views of key risks the results of key assumption sensitivity tests are reported to alco and brc at least quarterly the inventory of key assumptions and their associated sensitivity tests are reviewed with alco and brc at least annually market risk from trading activities as a financial intermediary truist provides its clients access to derivatives foreign exchange and securities markets which generate market risks trading market risk is managed using a multifaceted risk management approach which includes measuring risk using var stress testing and sensitivity analysis risk metrics are monitored against a suite of limits on a daily basis at both the trading desk level and at the aggregate portfolio level truist is also subject to riskbased capital guidelines for market risk under the market risk rule truist financial corporation covered trading positions covered positions subject to the market risk rule include trading assets and liabilities specifically those held for the purpose of shortterm resale or with the intent of benefiting from actual or expected shortterm price movements or to lock in arbitrage profits truists trading portfolio of covered positions results primarily from market making and underwriting services for the companys clients as well as associated risk mitigating hedging activity the trading portfolio measured in terms of var consists primarily of four subportfolios of covered positions i credit trading ii fixed income securities iii interest rate derivatives and iv equity derivatives as a market maker across different asset classes truists trading portfolio also contains other subportfolios including foreign exchange loan trading and commodity derivatives however these portfolios do not generate material trading risk exposures valuation policies and methodologies exist for all trading positions additionally these positions are subject to independent price verification see note derivative financial instruments note fair value disclosures and critical accounting policies herein for discussion of valuation policies and methodologies securitizations as of september the aggregate market value of onbalance sheet securitization positions subject to the market risk rule which were nonagency asset backed securities positions was million consistent with the market risk rule requirements the company performs prepurchase due diligence on each securitization position to identify the characteristics including deal structure and the asset quality of the underlying assets that materially affect valuation and performance securitization positions are subject to truists comprehensive risk management framework which includes daily monitoring against a suite of limits there were no offbalance sheet securitization positions during the reporting period correlation trading positions the trading portfolio of covered positions did not contain any correlation trading positions as of september varbased measures var measures the potential loss of a given position or portfolio of positions at a specified confidence level and time horizon truist utilizes a historical var methodology to measure and aggregate risks across its covered trading positions for risk management purposes the var calculation is based on a historical simulation approach and measures the potential trading losses using a oneday holding period at a onetail confidence level for market risk rule purposes the company calculates var using a 10day holding period and a confidence level due to inherent limitations of the var methodology such as the assumption that past market behavior is indicative of future market performance var is only one of several tools used to measure and manage market risk other tools used to manage market risk include stress testing scenario analysis and stop loss limits the trading portfolios var profile is influenced by a variety of factors including the size and composition of the portfolio market volatility and the correlation between different positions a portfolio of trading positions is typically less risky than the sum of the risk from each of the individual subportfolios because under normal market conditions risk within each category partially offsets the exposure to other risk categories the following table

of idiosyncratic risk that could result from risk factors other than broad market movements eg default or event risks the market risk rule provides fixed risk weights under a standardized measurement method while also allowing a modelbased approach subject to regulatory approval truist utilizes the standardized measurement method to calculate the specific risk component of market risk regulatory capital as such incremental risk capital requirements do not apply var model backtesting in accordance with the market risk rule the company evaluates the accuracy of its var model through daily backtesting by comparing aggregate daily trading gains and losses excluding fees commissions reserves net interest income and intraday trading from covered positions with the corresponding daily varbased measures generated by the model as illustrated in the following graph there were no companywide var backtesting exceptions during the twelve months ended september the total number of companywide var backtesting exceptions over the preceding twelve months is used to determine the multiplication factor for the varbased capital requirement under the market risk rule the capital multiplication factor increases from a minimum of three to a maximum of four depending on the number of exceptions all companywide var backtesting exceptions are thoroughly reviewed in the context of var model use and performance there was no change in the capital multiplication factor over the preceding twelve months truist financial corporation model risk oversight mro is responsible for the independent model validation of all decision models including trading market risk models as part of ongoing monitoring efforts the performance of all trading risk models is reviewed regularly to evaluate model performance with emerging developments in financial markets assess evolving modeling approaches and identify potential model enhancement stress testing the company uses a range of stress testing techniques to help monitor risks across trading desks and to augment standard daily var and other risk limits reporting the stress testing framework is designed to quantify the impact of extreme but plausible stress scenarios that could lead to large unexpected losses stress tests include simulations for risk factor sensitivities historical repeats and hypothetical scenarios with varying liquidity horizons of key risk factors all trading positions within each applicable market risk category interest rate risk equity risk foreign exchange rate risk credit spread risk and commodity price risk are included in the companys stress testing framework management reviews stress testing scenarios and makes updates on an ongoing basis management also utilizes stress analyses to support the companys capital adequacy assessment standards see the capital section of mda for additional discussion of capital adequacy liquidity liquidity represents the continuing ability to meet funding needs including deposit withdrawals repayment of borrowings and other liabilities and funding of loan commitments in addition to the level of liquid assets such as cash cash equivalents and highly liquid unencumbered securities other factors affect the ability to meet liquidity needs including access to a variety of funding sources maintaining borrowing capacity growing core deposits

conditions in considering its liquidity position management evaluates truists funding mix based on client core funding client ratesensitive funding and national markets funding in addition management evaluates exposure to ratesensitive funding sources that mature in one year or less management also measures liquidity needs for up to oneyear of stressed cash outflows for truist and truist bank management maintains a liquid asset buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is designed to meet projected days of stressed cash outflows internal liquidity stress testing liquidity stress testing is conducted for truist and truist bank using a variety of institutionspecific and marketwide adverse scenarios each liquidity stress test scenario applies defined assumptions to execute sources and uses of liquidity over varying planning horizons the types of expected liquidity uses during a stressed event may include deposit attrition contractual maturities reductions in unsecured and secured funding and increased draws on unfunded commitments to mitigate liquidity outflows truist has identified sources of liquidity however access to these sources of liquidity could be affected within a stressed environment truist maintains a liquidity buffer of cash on hand and highly liquid unencumbered securities that is designed to meet the projected 30day net stressed cashflow needs truists liquidity buffer is substantially the same in composition to what qualifies as hqla under the lcr rule contingency funding plan truist has a contingency funding plan designed to address ongoing obligations and commitments particularly in the event of a liquidity contraction this plan is designed to examine and quantify the organizations liquidity under the various internal liquidity stress scenarios and is periodically tested to assess the plans reliability additionally the plan provides a framework for management and other teammates to follow in the event of a liquidity contraction or in anticipation of such an event the plan addresses authority for activation and decision making liquidity options and the responsibilities of key departments in the event of a liquidity contraction lcr nsfr and hqla the lcr rule requires that truist and truist bank maintain an amount of eligible hqla that is sufficient within the parameters of the rule to meet their

believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet truists on and offbalance sheet obligations truist funds its balance sheet through diverse sources of funding including client deposits secured and unsecured capital markets funding and shareholders equity truist banks primary source of funding is client deposits continued access to client deposits is highly dependent on public confidence in the stability of truist bank and its ability to return funds to clients when requested truist bank maintains a number of diverse funding sources to meet its liquidity requirements these sources include unsecured borrowings from the capital markets through the issuance of senior or subordinated bank notes institutional cds overnight and term federal funds markets and retail brokered

and other intangible assets effective january several business activities were realigned reflecting updates to the companys operating structure first the cbw segment was renamed csbb and the ccb segment was renamed wb second the wealth business was realigned into the wb segment from the csbb segment representing a separate reporting unit in that segment third the small business banking client segmentation was realigned into the csbb segment from the wb segment further tih was the principal legal entity of the ih segment as the operations of tih were included in discontinued operations prior to the sale of tih the company no longer presents the ih segment as one of its reportable segments following these realignments the companys three reporting units with goodwill balances were csbb wb and wealth also in conjunction with these realignments goodwill of billion was realigned to wb from csbb based on the relative fair value of csbb and wealth and goodwill of million was realigned to csbb from wb based on the relative fair value of wb and the realigned small business banking client segmentation in addition the company completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all impacted reporting units immediately prior and subsequent to the reassignments and determined that no impairment existed the quantitative valuations of these reporting units for purposes of realigning goodwill use the income approach and a marketbased approach each weighted at the inputs and assumptions specific to each reporting unit are incorporated in the valuations including projections of future cash flows discount rates and applicable valuation multiples based on the comparable public company information the income approach utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis of multiyear financial forecasts developed for each reporting unit by considering several inputs and assumptions such as net interest margin expected credit losses noninterest income noninterest expense and required capital the marketbased approach utilizes comparable public company information key valuation multiples and considers a market control premium associated with cost synergies and other cash flow benefits that arise from obtaining control over a reporting unit and guideline transactions when applicable truist also assesses the reasonableness of the aggregate estimated fair value of the reporting units by comparison to its market capitalization over a reasonable period of time including consideration of expected acquirer expense synergies historic bank control premiums and the current market the projection of net interest margin and noninterest expense are the most significant inputs to the financial projections of the csbb wb and wealth reporting units the longterm growth rate used in determining the terminal value of each reporting unit was as of january based on managements assessment of the minimum expected terminal growth rate of each reporting unit discount rates are estimated based on the capital asset pricing model which considers the riskfree interest rate market risk premium beta and unsystematic risk adjustments specific to a particular reporting unit the discount rates are also calibrated based on risks related to the projected cash flows of each reporting unit the discount rates utilized for the csbb wb and wealth reporting units as of january were and respectively the quantitative valuation of wb performed in conjunction with the goodwill realignments indicated that as of january the fair value of the wb
