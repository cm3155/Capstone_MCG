ratings are confidential bank acquisitions by huntington bhcs such as huntington must obtain prior approval of the federal reserve in connection with any acquisition that results in the bhc owning or controlling or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or another bhc acquisitions of ownership of the company acquisitions of huntingtons voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws including the bhc act and the change in bank control act of under the change in bank control act a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the federal reserve before acquiring the power to vote or more of our outstanding common stock investors should be aware of these requirements when acquiring shares in our stock form 10k interstate banking under the riegleneal act a bhc may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years and the requirement that the bhc not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bhcs initial entry into the state more than of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches a national bank such as the bank with the approval of the occ may open a branch in any state if the law of that state would permit a state bank chartered in that state to establish the branch enhanced prudential standards bhcs with consolidated assets of more than billion such as huntington are currently subject to certain enhanced prudential standards as a result huntington is subject to more stringent standards including liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing resolution planning and risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards as a category iv banking organization huntington is subject to the least restrictive enhanced prudential standards applicable to firms with billion or more in total consolidated assets liquidity requirements huntington as a category iv banking organization with less than billion in weighted shortterm wholesale funding is exempt from the lcr and net stable funding ratio requirements but continues to be subject to internal liquidity stress tests and standards longterm debt requirements in august the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would require certain large banking organizations such as huntington to comply with longterm debt requirements and clean holding company requirements similar to those that currently only apply to us global systemically important banking organizations this proposal would also impose a longterm debt requirement on certain categories of insured depository institutions that are not consolidated subsidiaries of us global systematically important banking organizations including insured depository institutions with billion or more in total assets such as the bank if adopted this proposal would require huntington and the bank to each maintain a minimum outstanding eligible longterm debt amount of no less than the greater of i of total riskweighted assets ii of total leverage exposure if subject to the supplementary leverage ratio or iii of average total consolidated assets to comply with the requirement the bank would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt to huntington and huntington would be required to issue the minimum amount of eligible longterm debt externally the proposal allows banking organizations to include as part of the required minimum outstanding eligible longterm debt amounts certain existing longterm debt once the rule is finalized covered institutions would have three years to comply with the new requirements following a phasedin approach with of the longterm debt requirement by one year after finalization of the rule after two years and after three years in addition if adopted as proposed the clean holding company requirements would limit or prohibit huntington from entering into certain transactions that could impede its orderly resolution including for example prohibiting huntington from entering into transactions that could spread losses to subsidiaries and third parties as well as limiting the amount of the companys liabilities that are not eligible longterm debt regulatory capital requirements huntington and the bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements under the us basel iii capital rules adopted by the federal reserve for huntington and by the occ for the bank these rules implement the basel iii international regulatory capital standards in the us as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner huntington bancshares incorporated under the us basel iii capital rules huntingtons and the banks assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions riskweighted assets these riskweighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for huntington and the bank cet1 riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets cet1 capital primarily includes common shareholders equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions including goodwill intangible assets certain deferred tax assets and aoci tier riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital is primarily comprised of cet1 capital perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments total riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of total capital including cet1 capital tier capital and tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying alll tier capital also includes among other things certain trust preferred securities tier leverage ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions huntington and the bank elected to temporarily delay certain effects of cecl on regulatory capital until january pursuant to a rule that allowed bhcs and banks to delay for two years of the dayone impact of adopting cecl and of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting cecl as of december we have phased in of the cumulative cecl deferral with the remaining impact to be recognized through the first quarter the total minimum regulatory capital ratios and wellcapitalized minimum ratios are reflected in the table below in this section the federal reserve has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bhcs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the us basel iii capital rules for purposes of the federal reserves regulation y including determining whether a bhc meets the requirements to be an fhc bhcs such as huntington must maintain a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater if the federal reserve were to apply the same or a very similar wellcapitalized standard to bhcs as that applicable to the bank huntingtons capital ratios as of december would exceed such revised wellcapitalized standard the federal reserve may require bhcs including huntington to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bhcs particular condition risk profile and growth plans failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on huntingtons or the banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications in addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements under the us basel iii capital rules huntington and the bank must maintain the applicable capital buffer scb or ccb requirements to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management huntington is subject to a scb of effective for the period october through september refer to the scb requirements section below for further details the bank is subject to a ccb of the tier leverage ratio is not impacted by the scb or ccb and a banking institution may be considered wellcapitalized while remaining out of compliance with the scb or ccb form 10k the following table presents the minimum regulatory capital ratios

applicable as of the end of table start minimum regulatory capital ratio minimum ratio capital buffer wellcapitalized minimums at december actual ratios cet1 riskbased capital ratio consolidated na bank tier riskbased capital ratio consolidated bank total riskbased capital ratio consolidated bank tier leverage ratio consolidated na na bank na table end reflects a scb of for huntington and ccb of for the bank reflects the wellcapitalized standard applicable to huntington under federal reserve regulation y and the wellcapitalized standard applicable to the bank huntington has the ability to provide additional capital to the bank to maintain the banks riskbased capital ratios at levels which would be considered wellcapitalized as of december huntingtons and the banks regulatory capital ratios were above the wellcapitalized standards and met the applicable capital buffer requirements basel iii endgame proposal in july the us banking agencies issued a proposed rule to implement the basel iii endgame agreement for large banks basel iii endgame proposal in addition to calculating riskweighted assets under the current us standardized approach the proposal introduces a new expanded riskbased approach as compared with the standardized approach the expanded riskbased approach includes more granular risk weights for credit risk and introduces a new market risk framework the expanded riskbased approach also includes operational risk and credit valuation adjustment riskweighted asset components the proposal also would require the new market risk standards from the proposal be applied in the standardized approach if adopted as proposed huntington would be required to calculate its riskbased capital ratios under both the current us standardized approach and the expanded riskbased approach and would be subject to the lower of the two resulting ratios for each riskbased capital ratio the proposal would also require banking organizations to recognize most elements of aoci in regulatory capital including unrealized gains and losses on availableforsale securities and lower thresholds for deductions from cet1 capital for mortgage servicing assets and deferred tax assets among other things in addition the proposal would apply the scb to riskbased capital requirements calculated under both us standardized approach and the expanded riskbased approach the proposal includes a proposed effective date of july with threeyear transition arrangements until revised standards are fully phased in on july capital planning and stress testing huntington is required to develop maintain and submit to the federal reserve a capital plan every year which is subject to supervisory review in connection with the federal reserves ccar process huntington is required to include within its capital plan an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over the ninequarter planning horizon a detailed description of the process for assessing capital adequacy its capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to its business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy under the stress buffer requirements the ccar process is used to determine a bhcs scb requirement please refer to the scb requirements section below for further details huntington bancshares incorporated the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar such as huntington to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases this involves a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above certain minimum ratios after taking all capital actions included in a bhcs capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout the ninequarter planning horizon as part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether bhcs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether they have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks we are generally prohibited from making a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution we will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios huntington may increase certain types of capital distributions in excess of the amount included in its capital plan without seeking prior approval from the federal reserve as long as it otherwise complies with the automatic restrictions on distributions under the federal reserves capital rules although the federal reserve is no longer allowed to object to the capital plan of a large and noncomplex bhc such as huntington on a qualitative as opposed to quantitative basis the federal reserve may evaluate the strength of huntingtons qualitative capital planning process through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning scb requirements for riskbased capital requirements huntington as a large bhc is provided an scb by the federal reserve that is determined annually based on the greater of i the difference between its starting and minimum projected cet1 riskbased capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of the dollar amount of huntingtons planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii on april huntington submitted its capital plan to the federal reserve for supervisory review by notice dated june the federal reserve informed huntington that effective for the period of october through september its indicative scb requirement associated with its capital plan is a decrease from its previous scb of although we were not subject to the federal reserves supervisory stress test our indicative scb was updated for based on the dividend addon component of the scb huntington is authorized to make capital distributions that are consistent with the requirements in the federal reserves capital rule inclusive of the scb requirement provided that huntington is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the federal reserves capital rules huntington is no longer required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan restrictions on dividends huntington is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries since our consolidated net income consists largely of net income of huntingtons subsidiaries our ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends and repurchasing shares depends upon our receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries under federal law there are various limitations on the extent to which the bank can declare and pay dividends to huntington including those related to regulatory capital requirements general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits surplus and available earnings certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to huntington no assurances can be given that the bank will in any circumstances pay dividends to huntington huntingtons ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders is similarly limited by federal banking law and federal reserve regulations and policy as discussed in the capital planning section above in general a bhc may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected huntington and the bank must maintain the applicable capital buffer requirements to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends for more information on the capital buffer requirements see the scb requirements and the regulatory capital requirements sections above form 10k the federal reserve has indicated generally that it may be an unsafe or unsound practice for a bhc to pay dividends unless a its net income is sufficient to fund the dividends and the expected rate of earnings retention is consistent with its capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition the federal reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a bhc if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice volcker rule under the volcker rule we are prohibited from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for our own account and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting trading in us government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities such as huntington we have put in place the compliance programs required by the volcker rule and any holdings in illiquid covered funds are in compliance with the volcker rule resolution planning as a category iv banking organization huntington is not required to submit a resolution plan to the federal reserve as an insured depository institution the bank is required to file a resolution plan with the fdic and the bank submitted its most recent resolution plan to the fdic on november in august the fdic issued a proposed rule that would require covered insured depository institutions such as the bank to submit a full resolution plan to the fdic every two years and submit an interim supplement in each year that it is not required to submit a full resolution plan the proposed rule would also increase the content requirements for plan submissions and introduce a new credibility standard for the fdics evaluation of resolution plans which would be enforceable against the covered insured depository institutions source of strength huntington is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank and under appropriate conditions to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of huntington or our shareholders or creditors the federal reserve may require a bhc to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bhc with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bhc fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bhcs ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements huntington may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should it experience financial distress capital loans by huntington to the bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the bank in the event of huntingtons bankruptcy any commitment by huntington to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment fdic as receiver or conservator of huntington upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution such as the bank the fdic may be appointed as the conservator or receiver of the institution under the orderly liquidation authority upon the insolvency of a bhc such as huntington the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bhc if certain findings are made by the fdic the federal reserve and the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the president acting as a conservator or receiver the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of the institution without the approval of the institutions creditors huntington bancshares incorporated depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution including the bank the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if the bank were to fail insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic would have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including huntington with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution transactions between a bank and its affiliates federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between a bank and its holding company and companies that the bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it the doddfrank act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as the bank and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders lending standards and guidance the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate under these regulations all insured depository institutions such as the bank must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards prudent underwriting standards including loantovalue limits that are clear and measurable loan administration procedures and documentation approval and reporting requirements the real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulatory agencies interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies heightened governance and risk management standards the occ has published guidelines to set expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions including the bank the guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities in addition the guidelines provide standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework as discussed in the risk management and capital section of the mda the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls form 10k antimoney laundering the bank secrecy act and the patriot act contain antimoney laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the us financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an aml program verifying the identity of customers verifying the identity of certain beneficial owners for legal entity customers monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies the bank is subject to the bank secrecy act and therefore is required to provide its employees with aml training designate an aml compliance officer and undergo an annual independent audit to assess the effectiveness of its aml program the bank has implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these aml requirements bank regulators are focusing their examinations on aml compliance and we will continue to monitor and augment where necessary our aml compliance programs the federal banking agencies are required when reviewing bank and bhc acquisition or merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the aml activities of the applicant the antimoney laundering act of enacted on january as part of the national defense authorization act does not directly impose new requirements on banks but requires the us treasury to issue national antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may over the next few years significantly alter some of the due diligence recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the bank secrecy act and patriot act impose on banks the antimoney laundering act of also contains provisions that promote increased informationsharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the bank secrecy act and includes whistleblower incentives both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement ofac regulation ofac is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and in various legislation ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets for example property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences data privacy federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions the glba requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances other federal and state laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers these security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations as applicable federal law also makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means huntington bancshares incorporated data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example under california state law the ccpa broadly defines personal information and substantially increases the rights of california residents to understand how their personal information is collected used and otherwise processed by commercial businesses such as affording them the right to access and request deletion of their information and to opt out of certain sharing and sales of personal information the ccpa contemplates civil penalties of up to for each violation and up to for each intentional violation and includes a private right of action permitting lawsuits to be brought by private individuals instead of the state attorney general or other government actor for certain breaches in addition laws in all us states require businesses to provide notice under certain circumstances to consumers whose personal information has been disclosed as a result of a data breach moreover the us congress has recently considered and is currently considering various proposals for more comprehensive data privacy and security legislation to which we may be subject if passed like other lenders the bank and other of our subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fcra and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on us and our subsidiaries fdic insurance the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of per depositor and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions based on the risk each institution poses to the dif the bank accepts customer deposits that are insured by the dif and therefore must pay insurance premiums the fdic may increase the banks insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdics assessment of its risk profile the fdic also requires large insured depository institutions including the bank to maintain enhanced deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system capabilities to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail the fdic as required under the fdia established a plan on september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed the statutory minimum of within eight years this plan did not include an increase in the deposit insurance assessment rate based on the fdics recent projections however the fdic determined that the dif reserve ratio is at risk of not reaching the statutory minimum by the statutory deadline of september without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rates in october the fdic adopted a final rule to increase initial base deposit insurance assessment rate schedules uniformly by basis points beginning on january the fdic also concurrently maintained the designated reserve ratio for the dif at in november the fdic issued a final rule to implement a special assessment to recoup losses to the dif associated with bank failures in the first half of under the final rule the assessment base for the special assessment is equal to an insured depository institutions estimated uninsured deposits reported as of december adjusted to exclude the first billion of uninsured deposits the final rule provides that the fdic will collect the special assessment at a quarterly rate of basis points over eight quarterly assessment periods subject to change depending on any adjustments to the loss estimate mergers or failures or amendments to reported estimates of uninsured deposits based on the banks reported uninsured deposits as of december the entire estimated amount of approximately million was recognized as an accrued liability and related expense in the fourth quarter of the final rule becomes effective april and the first collection will be reflected on the invoice for the first quarterly assessment period of with the first payment due on june compensation our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve and with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees by other financial regulatory bodies the scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will continue to evolve over a number of years form 10k the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations such as huntington and the bank do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization the sec also finalized a rule that directs stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentivebased compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and requires companies to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies cybersecurity the glba requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information the cisa is intended to improve cybersecurity in the us by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the us government and private sector entities including financial institutions the cisa also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems notwithstanding any other provision of law and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from cyberattacks the law includes liability protections for companies that share cyberthreat information with third parties so long as such sharing activity is conducted in accordance with cisa in addition effective april the federal reserve occ and fdic issued a rule that among other things requires a banking organization to notify its primary federal regulator within hours after identifying a computersecurity incident that the banking organization believes in good faith could materially disrupt degrade or impair its business or operations in a manner that would among other things jeopardize the viability of its operations result in customers being unable to access their deposit and other accounts result in a material loss of revenue profit or franchise value or pose a threat to the financial stability of the us community reinvestment act the cra is intended to encourage banks to help meet the credit needs of their service areas including low and moderateincome neighborhoods consistent with safe and soundness practices the relevant federal bank regulatory agency the occ in the banks case examines each bank and assigns it a public cra rating a banks record of fair lending compliance is part of the resulting cra examination report the cra requires the relevant federal bank regulatory agency to consider a banks cra assessment when considering the banks application to conduct certain mergers or acquisitions or to open or relocate a branch office the federal reserve also must consider the cra record of each subsidiary bank of a bhc in connection with any acquisition or merger application filed by the bhc an unsatisfactory cra record could substantially delay or result in the denial of an approval or application by huntington or the bank the bank received the highest possible overall cra rating of outstanding in its most recent examination in october the us banking agencies issued a final rule to amend their regulations implementing the cra the rule materially revises the current cra framework including the assessment areas in which a bank is evaluated to include activities associated with online and mobile banking the tests used to evaluate the bank in its assessment areas new methods of calculating credit for lending investment and service activities and additional data collection and reporting requirements the rule is expected to result in a significant increase in the thresholds for large banks to receive outstanding ratings in the future the rule is expected to take effect on april with most of its provisions becoming applicable on january reporting of the collected data will not be required until huntington bancshares incorporated debit interchange fees we are subject to a statutory requirement that interchange fees for electronic debit transactions that are paid to or charged by payment card issuers including the bank be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer interchange fees for electronic debit transactions are limited to  plus of the transaction plus an additional one cent per transaction fraud adjustment these fees impose requirements regarding routing and exclusivity of electronic debit transactions on october the federal reserve finalized a rule that amends regulation ii to among other things specify that debit card issuers should enable all debit card transactions including cardnotpresent transactions such as online payments to be processed on at least two unaffiliated payment card networks the final rule became effective july as an issuer with over billion in assets huntington is subject to regulation ii and is in compliance with these new requirements in october the federal reserve released a notice of proposed rulemaking that would lower the maximum interchange fee that a large debit card issuer can receive on a debit card transaction under the proposal the base component would initially decrease from  to  the ad valorem component would decrease from basis points to basis points multiplied by the value of the transaction and the fraudprevention adjustment would increase from  to  for debit card transactions performed from the effective date of the final rule to june in addition the proposal would adopt an approach for future adjustments to the interchange fee cap which would occur every other year based on issuer cost data gathered from large debit card issuers consumer protection regulation and supervision we are subject to supervision and regulation by the cfpb with respect to federal consumer protection laws we are also subject to certain state consumer protection laws and under the doddfrank act state attorneys general and other state officials are empowered to enforce certain federal consumer protection laws and regulations state authorities have increased their focus on and enforcement of consumer protection rules these federal and state consumer protection laws apply to a broad range of our activities and to various aspects of our business and include laws relating to interest rates fair lending disclosures of credit terms and estimated transaction costs to consumer borrowers debt collection practices the use of and the provision of information to consumer reporting agencies and the prohibition of unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices in connection with the offer sale or provision of consumer financial products and services in january the cfpb
