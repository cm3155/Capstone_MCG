indiana kentucky michigan minnesota pennsylvania west virginia and wisconsin select financial services and other activities are also conducted in various other states this mda provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations and cash flows the mda included in our annual report on s with the sec the mda included

conjunction with the unaudited consolidated financial statements notes to unaudited consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report our definition philosophy and approach to risk management have not materially changed from the discussion presented in the annual report on form 10k credit risk credit risk is the risk of financial loss if a counterparty is not able to meet the agreed upon terms of the financial obligation the majority of our credit risk is associated with lending activities as the acceptance and management of credit risk is central to profitable lending we also have credit risk associated with our investment securities portfolios see note investment securities and other securities of the notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements we engage with other financial counterparties for a variety of purposes including investing asset and liability management mortgage banking and trading activities a variety of derivative financial instruments principally interest rate swaps caps swaptions swaption collars floors forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps are used in asset and liability management activities to protect against the risk of adverse price or interest rate movements we also use derivatives principally loan sale commitments in hedging our mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and mortgage loans held for sale while there is credit risk associated with derivative activity we believe this exposure is minimal huntington bancshares incorporated we focus on the early identification monitoring and management of all aspects of our credit risk in addition to the traditional credit risk mitigation strategies of credit policies and processes market risk management activities and portfolio diversification we use quantitative measurement capabilities that utilize external data sources enhanced modeling technology and internal stress testing processes our

is underway and will continue through early causing the unemployment rate to gradually increase peaking at in before marginally improving to by the overnight federal funds rate is forecasted to have peaked during the third quarter of remaining at this terminal level through mid2024 as the federal reserve continues to address inflation levels and tightness in the labor market the federal reserve is expected to complete a total of four basis points cuts by the end of further subsequent cuts of basis points per quarter are expected in and until reaching by the second half of inflation is forecasted to drop from in first quarter approaching the federal reserve target level of by fourth quarter the gdp forecast for the second quarter of into is broadly consistent with year end a result of elevated interest rates and tightening credit conditions gdp is now forecasted to be by the fourth quarter of management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse

scenario forecast inputs for each period presented not updated for subsequent actual amounts huntington bancshares incorporated management continues to assess the uncertainty in the macroeconomic environment including ongoing risks in the commercial real estate environment current inflation levels political uncertainty and geopolitical instability considering multiple macroeconomic forecasts that reflect a range of possible outcomes while we have incorporated estimates of economic uncertainty into our acl the ultimate impact of specific challenges in the commercial real estate industry recent inflation levels higher interest rates and the significant conflicts ongoing around the world will have on the economy remains unknown management develops additional analytics to support adjustments to our modeled results our allowance for credit loss development methodology committee reviewed model results of each economic scenario for appropriate usage concluding that the quantitative transaction reserve will continue to utilize scenario weighting given the uncertainty associated with key economic scenario assumptions the march acl included a general reserve that consists of various risk profile components including profiles to capture uncertainty not addressed within the quantitative transaction reserve our acl evaluation process includes the ongoing

changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans huntington bancshares incorporated we measure market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior our models incorporate marketbased assumptions that include the impact of changing interest rates on prepayment rates of assets and runoff rates of deposits the models also include our projections of the future volume and pricing of various business lines in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in our balance sheet we compare a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward rates reflect the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are immediate parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates we presume that market rates will not go below the scenarios are inclusive of all executed interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon a key driver of our interest rate risk profile is our interestbearing deposit repricing sensitivity assumptions to changes in interest rates otherwise known as deposit beta in addition our interest expense is impacted by the composition of both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits in relation to our total deposits accordingly we consider the impacts from both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits on our total deposit beta our cumulative todate total deposit beta total cost of deposits is within the current cycle which started in march we use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis eve at risk nii at risk is used by management to measure the risk and impact to earnings over the next months using a variety of interest rate scenarios the nii at risk results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual ramp and basis point parallel shift scenarios implied by the forward yield curve over the next months table net interest income at risk at march at december federal funds rate federal funds rate basis point change scenario starting point month nii at risk starting point month nii at risk base represents the upper bound represents the spot federal funds rate represents the federal funds rate in month given a gradual parallel ramp relative to the base implied forward scenario the nii at risk shows that the balance sheet is asset sensitive at both march and december the primary drivers to the change in sensitivity include market rates mortgage prepayment assumptions deposit modeling assumptions projected balance sheet composition over the simulation horizon and hedging activity form 10q eve at risk is used by management to measure the impact of interest rate changes on the net present value of assets and liabilities including derivative exposures the eve results included in the table below reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models immediate and basis point parallel shock scenarios from the yield curve term points at the specific point in time that eve sensitivity is measured table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario at march at december the change in sensitivity from december was driven primarily by market rates mortgage prepayment assumptions deposit modeling assumptions actual balance sheet composition and hedging activity use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps caps and floors collars forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps table shows all swap swaption swaption collar and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates the interest rate variability may impact either the fair value of the assets and liabilities or impact the cash flows attributable to net interest margin these positions are used to protect the fair value of asset and liabilities by converting the contractual interest rate on a specified amount of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index the positions are also used to hedge the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate by converting the variable rate index into a fixed rate the volume maturity and mix of derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and fair values of these derivatives refer to note derivative financial

receive resets weighted average fixed fate column represents pay rate reset forward starting swaps effective starting from april to march use of derivatives to manage credit risk we may utilize credit derivatives as a tool to manage credit risk within the portfolio by purchasing credit protection over certain types of loan products when we purchase credit protection such as a cds we pay a fee to the seller or cds counterparty in return for the right to receive a payment if a specified credit event occurs form 10q msrs this section should be read in conjunction with note mortgage loan sales and servicing rights of notes to the unaudited consolidated financial statements at march we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments and declines in credit quality prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report changes in the msr value net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income msr assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the unaudited consolidated financial statements price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions derivative instruments and equity investments we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner the goal of liquidity management is to ensure adequate stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy changes in loan and lease demand unexpected levels of deposit withdrawals investment opportunities and other contractual obligations we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we mitigate liquidity risk by maintaining liquid assets in the form of cash cash equivalents and securities in addition we maintain a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of readily available wholesale funding sources including secured funding sources from the fhlb and federal reserve through pledged borrowing capacity issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of contingency funding plans at march management believes current sources of liquidity are sufficient to meet huntingtons on and offbalance sheet obligations we maintain a contingency funding plan that provides for liquidity stress testing which assesses the potential erosion of funds in the event of an institutionspecific event or systemic financial market crisis examples of institution specific events could include a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency a large charge to earnings declines in profitability or other financial measures declines in liquidity sources including reductions in deposit balances or access to contingent funding sources or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events failure of a major financial institution or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the contingency funding plan which is reviewed and approved by the roc at least annually outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis and provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period and outlines early warning indicators that are used to monitor emerging liquidity stress events huntington bancshares incorporated our largest source of liquidity on a consolidated basis is core deposits which provide stable and lowercost funding core deposits were billion at march which comprised of total deposits compared to billion and of total deposits at december the billion or increase in core deposits compared to december was primarily driven by an increase in consumer core deposits our core deposits come from a base of primary bank customer relationships and we continue to focus on acquiring and deepening those relationships resulting in our granular and diversified deposit base noncore deposits consist primarily of brokered money market balances noncore deposits were billion or of total deposits at march compared to billion or of total deposits at december noncore deposits were below our established liquidity

intercompany deposits which are not customer deposits and are therefore eliminated through consolidation as of march the bank call report uninsured deposit balance was billion which includes billion of intercompany deposits as of december the bank call report uninsured deposit balance was billion which includes billion of intercompany deposits cash and cash equivalents were billion and billion at march and december respectively the billion increase in cash and cash equivalents is primarily due to an increase in interestbearing deposits at the federal reserve bank to support shortterm liquidity our investment securities portfolio is evaluated under established alco objectives changing market conditions could affect the profitability of the portfolio as well as the level of interest rate risk exposure total investment securities were billion at march compared to billion at december the billion increase in securities compared to december was primarily due to increased investment in us treasury securities at march the duration of the investment securities portfolio was years or years net of hedging securities are pledged to secure borrowing capacity with the fhlb and the federal reserve discussed further in the bank liquidity and sources of funding section below at march investment securities with market value of billion were unpledged form 10q sources of wholesale funding include noncore deposits other domestic deposits of or more negotiable cds brokered and other deposits shortterm borrowings and longterm debt our wholesale funding totaled billion at march compared to billion at december the increase from year end is primarily due to increases in collateralized borrowings and senior notes partially offset by a decrease in repurchase agreements bank liquidity and sources of funding our primary sources of funding for the bank are consumer and commercial core deposits at march these core deposits funded of total assets of total loans and leases to the extent we are unable to obtain sufficient liquidity through core deposits and cash and cash equivalents we may meet our liquidity needs through sources of wholesale funding and asset securitization or sale the bank maintains borrowing capacity at both the fhlb and the federal reserve secured by pledged loans and securities the bank does not consider borrowing capacity at the federal reserve a primary source of funding however it could be used as a potential source of liquidity in a stressed environment or during a market disruption at march the banks available contingent borrowing capacity at the fhlb and federal reserve totaled billion compared to billion at december the amount of available contingent borrowing capacity may fluctuate based on the level of borrowings outstanding and level of assets pledged at march we believe the bank has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future parent company liquidity the parent companys funding requirements consist primarily of dividends to shareholders debt service income taxes operating expenses funding of nonbank subsidiaries repurchases of our stock and acquisitions the parent company obtains funding to meet obligations from dividends and interest received from the bank interest and dividends received from direct subsidiaries net taxes collected from subsidiaries included in the federal consolidated tax return fees for services provided to subsidiaries and the issuance of debt securities the parent company had cash and cash equivalents of billion and billion at march and december respectively on april our board of directors declared a quarterly common stock cash dividend of per common share the dividend is payable on july to shareholders of record on june based on the current quarterly dividend of per common share cash demands required for common stock dividends are estimated to be approximately million per quarter additionally on april our board of directors declared a quarterly series b series e series f series g series h and series j preferred stock dividend payable on july to shareholders of record on july on march our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend for the series i preferred stock payable on june to shareholders of record on may total cash demands required for preferred stock dividends are expected to be approximately million per quarter during the first three months of the bank paid preferred and common dividends to the parent company of million and million respectively to meet any additional liquidity needs the parent company may issue debt or equity securities to support the parent companys ability to issue debt or equity securities we have filed with the sec an automatic registration statement covering an indeterminate amount or number of securities to be offered or sold from time to time as authorized by huntingtons board of directors at march we believe the company has sufficient liquidity and capital resources to meet its cash flow obligations over the next months and for the foreseeable future offbalance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps caps and floors swaption collars financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans huntington bancshares incorporated operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error thirdparty performance failures or inadequate or failed internal systems and controls including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters failed business contingency plans and security risks we continuously strive to test and strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with significant contracts agreements laws rules and regulations and to reduce our exposure to fraud and improve the oversight of our operational risk to govern operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee a fraud risk committee an information and technology risk committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and our audit committee as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational riskmonitoring minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance cybersecurity cybersecurity represents an important component of huntingtons overall crossfunctional approach to risk management we actively manage a cybersecurity operation designed to detect contain and respond to cybersecurity threats and incidents in a prompt and effective manner with the goal of minimizing disruptions to our business we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate our technology processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats continue to evolve and increase across the entire digital landscape we actively monitor our environment for malicious content and implement specific cybersecurity and fraud capabilities including the monitoring of phishing email campaigns in addition we have implemented specific cybersecurity and fraud monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce has the option to work remotely our objective for managing cybersecurity risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of both internal and external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before an attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on their objectives to this end we employ a set of defenseindepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cybersecurity may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cybersecurity risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates to ensure awareness of the risks of cybersecurity threats at all levels across the organization internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cybersecurity risk management framework and controls we also require thirdparty vendors to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality form 10q compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending andor other courses related to the extension of credit we hold ourselves to a high standard for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance capital our primary capital objective is to maintain appropriate levels of capital within our boardapproved risk appetite to support the banks operations absorb unanticipated losses and declines in asset values and provide protection to uninsured depositors and debt holders in the event of liquidation while also funding organic growth and providing appropriate returns to our shareholders both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing our overall capital adequacy including the monitoring and reporting of capital risk metrics to the board and roc that we believe are useful for evaluating capital adequacy and making capital decisions in addition to asreported regulatory capital and tangible common equity metrics we also actively monitor other measures of capital such as tangible common equity including the marktomarket impact on htm securities and cet1 inclusive of aoci excluding cash flow hedges we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate

shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends and share repurchases other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk appetite and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled billion at march a decrease of million when compared with december the decrease was primarily driven by changes in accumulated other comprehensive income driven by changes in interest rates partially offset by earnings net of dividends share repurchases from time to time our board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when our board authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations on january our board authorized the repurchase of up to billion of common shares within the eight quarter period ending december subject to the federal reserves capital regulations purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase programs during the three months ended march we repurchased no shares of common stock under the current repurchase authorization as part of the capital plan and our current expectation that organic capital will be used for funding loan and lease growth and proposed changes to regulatory capital requirements we do not expect to utilize the share repurchase program through however we may at our discretion resume share repurchases at any time while considering factors including but not limited to capital requirements and market conditions business segment discussion overview our business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how management monitors results and assesses performance we have two business segments consumer regional banking and commercial banking the treasury other function includes technology and operations and other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results

and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to the business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported acquisitionrelated expenses if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the business segments funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing modeled duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities the primary components of the ftp rate include a base market rate a liquidity premium and option

basis are considered nongaap financial measures management believes net interest income on an fte basis provides an insightful picture of the interest margin for comparison purposes the fte basis also allows management to assess the comparability of revenue arising from both taxable and taxexempt sources the fte basis assumes a federal statutory tax rate of we encourage readers to consider the unaudited consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10q in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure nonregulatory capital ratios in addition to capital ratios defined by banking regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible equity to tangible assets and tangible common equity to riskweighted assets using basel iii definitions these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures because there are no standardized definitions for these nonregulatory capital ratios the companys calculation methods may differ from those used by other financial services companies also there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result we encourage readers to consider the unaudited consolidated financial statements and other financial information contained in this form 10q in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form 10k as supplemented by this report including this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our critical accounting policies include the allowance for credit losses and goodwill the policies assumptions and judgments related to goodwill are described in the critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates section within the mda of huntingtons annual report on form 10k the following details the policies assumption and judgments related to the allowance for credit losses allowance for credit losses our acl at march represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded lending commitments management estimates the acl by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings form 10q one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted unemployment rates and gdp changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario contemplates an increased risk of an extended government shutdown concerns about bank failures raise fears of further collapse in the banking industry reducing consumer confidence and causing banks to tighten lending standards increased geopolitical tensions between china and taiwan briefly impact the supply chain for semiconductors and the threat of a wider conflict causes consumer confidence to fall additionally the russian invasion of ukraine lasts longer than in the baseline scenario and concerns increase around the hamasisrael conflict leading to a broader war in the middle east the combination of the risk of federal shutdown political tensions and tightening lending standards cause the stock market to fall the economy falls into a recession in the second quarter of in response to the recession the federal reserve starts lowering the federal funds rate in the second quarter of with significant rate reductions by the end of under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate increases from baseline levels and remains elevated for a prolonged period the rate is estimated at and at the end of and respectively this forecast reflects unemployment rates that are approximately higher than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters used in the calculation of our acl at march management calculated the difference between our quantitative acl and this adverse scenario excluding consideration of qualitative adjustments this sensitivity analysis would result in a hypothetical increase in our acl of approximately billion at march this hypothetical increase is reflective of the sensitivity of the rate of change in the unemployment variable on our models the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios and the sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework huntington bancshares incorporated we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as geopolitical instability or risks of inflation including a nearterm recession could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the geopolitical instability and risks of inflation will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note

renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature certain commitments to extend credit are secured by collateral including residential and commercial real estate inventory receivables cash and securities and other business assets form 10q standby lettersofcredit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years since the conditions under which huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was million and million at march and december respectively other guarantees huntington provides guarantees to certain thirdparty investors in connection with the sale of syndicated affordable housing tax credits these guarantees are generally in the form of makewhole provisions that are triggered if the underlying performance of lihtc properties result in a shortfall to the thirdparty investors and remain in effect until the final associated tax credits are realized the maximum amount guaranteed by the company under these arrangements total approximately million at both march and december and represents the guaranteed portion in these transactions where the makewhole provisions have not yet expired litigation and regulatory matters in the ordinary course of business huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines or penalties related to each matter may be huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established for certain matters huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss in cases in which huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below there may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible for those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is to million at march in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters this estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate the estimated range of possible loss does not represent huntingtons maximum loss exposure based on current knowledge management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of huntington further management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address huntingtons contingent liabilities however in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters some of which are beyond huntingtons control and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to huntingtons results of operations for any particular reporting period huntington bancshares incorporated segment reporting huntingtons business segments are based on our
