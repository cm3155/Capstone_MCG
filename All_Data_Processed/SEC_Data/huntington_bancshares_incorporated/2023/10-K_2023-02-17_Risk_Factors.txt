item risk factors the risks and uncertainties listed below present risks that could have a material impact on huntingtons financial condition the results of operations or its business some of these risks and uncertainties are interrelated and the occurrence of one or more of them may exacerbate the effect of others the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones huntington faces additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to huntington or that huntington believes to be immaterial may also adversely affect its business additionally refer to factors set forth under the caption forwardlooking statements for more information on how we manage risks see discussion in the risk governance section of our mda in addition to the other information included or incorporated by reference into this report readers should carefully consider that the following important factors among others could negatively impact our business future results of operations and future cash flows materially credit risks our acl level may prove to not be adequate or be negatively affected by credit risk exposures which could adversely affect our net income and capital our business depends on the creditworthiness of our customers our acl of billion at december represented managements estimate of the current expected losses in our loan and lease portfolio alll as well as our unfunded lending commitments aulc we regularly review our acl for appropriateness in doing so we consider probability of default loss given default and exposure at default depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term of the credit exposure the economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover lifetime losses of the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially decreases if the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations in addition regulatory review of risk ratings and loan and lease losses may impact the level of the acl and could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations weakness in economic conditions could adversely affect our business continued economic uncertainty and a recessionary or stagnant economy could adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations our performance could be negatively affected to the extent there is deterioration in business and economic conditions including persistent inflation rising interest rates supply chain issues or labor shortages which have direct or indirect material adverse impacts on us our customers and our counterparties these conditions could result in one or more of the following a decrease in the demand for loans and other products and services offered by us a decrease in customer savings generally and in the demand for savings and investment products offered by us and an increase in the number of customers and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us an increase in the number of delinquencies bankruptcies or defaults could result in a higher level of npas ncos provision for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale the markets we serve are dependent on industrial and manufacturing businesses and thus are particularly vulnerable to adverse changes in economic conditions affecting these sectors huntington bancshares incorporated a us government debt default would have a material adverse impact on our business and financial performance including a decrease in the value of treasury bonds and other government securities held by us which could negatively impact the banks capital position and its ability to meet regulatory requirements other negative impacts could be volatile capital markets an adverse impact on the us economy and the us dollar as well as increased default rates among borrowers in light of increased economic uncertainty some of these impacts might occur even in the absence of an actual default but as a consequence of extended political negotiations around the threat of such a default and a government shutdown market risks changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income reduce transactional income and negatively impact the value of our loans securities and other assets this could have an adverse impact on our cash flows financial condition results of operations and capital our results of operations depend substantially on net interest income which is the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets such as investments and loans and interest paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowings interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors including governmental monetary policies inflation and domestic and international economic and political conditions conditions such as inflation deflation recession unemployment money supply and other factors beyond our control may also affect interest rates in addition decisions by the federal reserve to increase or reduce the size of its balance sheet or to engage in tapering its purchase of assets may also affect interest rates if our interest earning assets mature or reprice faster than interest bearing liabilities in a declining interest rate environment net interest income could be materially adversely impacted likewise if interest bearing liabilities mature or reprice more quickly than interest earning assets in a rising interest rate environment net interest income could be adversely impacted changes in interest rates can affect the value of loans securities assets under management and other assets including mortgage servicing rights an increase in interest rates that adversely affects the ability of borrowers to pay the principal or interest on loans and leases may lead to an increase in npas and a reduction of income recognized which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flows when we place a loan on nonaccrual status we reverse any accrued but unpaid interest receivable which decreases interest income however we continue to incur interest expense as a cost of funding nals without any corresponding interest income in addition transactional income including trust income brokerage income and gain on sales of loans can vary significantly from periodtoperiod based on a number of factors including the interest rate environment a decline in interest rates along with a flattening yield curve limits our ability to reprice deposits given the current historically low level of interest rates and could result in declining net interest margins if longer duration assets reprice faster than deposits rising interest rates reduce the value of our fixedrate securities any unrealized loss from these portfolios impacts oci shareholders equity and the tangible common equity ratio any realized loss from these portfolios impacts regulatory capital ratios in a rising interest rate environment pension and other postretirement obligations somewhat mitigate negative oci impacts from securities and financial instruments for more information refer to market risk of the mda certain investment securities notably mortgagebacked securities are sensitive to rising and falling rates generally when rates rise prepayments of principal and interest will decrease and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will increase conversely when rates fall prepayments of principal and interest will increase and the duration of mortgagebacked securities will decrease in either case interest rates have a significant impact on the value of mortgagebacked securities msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise in addition to volatility associated with interest rates the company also has exposure to equity markets related to the investments within the benefit plans and other income from clientbased transactions form 10k inflation could negatively impact our business our profitability and our stock price prolonged periods of inflation may impact our profitability by negatively impacting our fixed costs and expenses including increasing funding costs and expense related to talent acquisition and retention additionally inflation may lead to a decrease in consumer and clients purchasing power and negatively affect the need or demand for our products and services if significant inflation continues our business could be negatively affected by among other things increased default rates leading to credit losses which could decrease our appetite for new credit extensions these inflationary pressures could result in missed earnings and budgetary projections causing our stock price to suffer industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive environment and we expect competition to intensify certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do enabling them to be more aggressive than us in competing for loans and deposits in our market areas we face competition from other banks and financial service companies that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business technological advances have made it possible for our nonbank competitors to offer products and services that traditionally were banking products and for financial institutions and other companies to provide electronic and internetbased financial solutions including mobile payments online deposit accounts electronic payment processing and marketplace lending without having a physical presence where their customers are located legislative or regulatory changes also could lead to increased competition in the financial services sector for example the economic growth act and the tailoring rules reduce the regulatory burden of certain large bhcs and raise the asset thresholds at which more onerous requirements apply which could cause certain large bhcs to become more competitive or to more aggressively pursue expansion our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors including customer convenience quality of service by investing in new products and services electronic platforms personal contacts pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability or a desire to do business with our competitors we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin for more information refer to competition section of item business the transition away from libor may adversely affect our business central banks around the world including the federal reserve have commissioned committees and working groups of market participants and official sector representatives to replace libor and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks the publication of most libor rates ceased as of the end of december while certain us dollar libor tenors are expected to continue to be published until june a transition away from the widespread use of libor to alternative rates and other potential interest rate benchmark reforms has begun and will continue over the course of the next few years these reforms may cause such rates to perform differently than in the past or to disappear entirely or have other consequences which cannot be predicted a group of market participants convened by the federal reserve the alternative reference rate committee arrc has selected sofr as its recommended alternative to libor the federal reserve bank of new york started to publish sofr in april sofr is a broad measure of the cost of overnight borrowings collateralized by treasury securities that was selected by the arrc due to the depth and robustness of the us treasury repurchase market in january of huntington was added as an arrc member the passage of the adjustable interest rate libor act by congress and the federal reserves implementing rule should decrease the risk of contracts that are not remediated prior to the cessation deadline by providing the terms for a transition to sofr huntington bancshares incorporated the market transition away from libor to an alternative reference rate such as sofr is complex and could have a range of adverse effects on our business financial condition and results of operations in particular any such transition could adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of huntingtons liborbased assets and liabilities which include certain variable rate loans huntingtons series b preferred stock certain of huntingtons junior subordinated debentures certain of the banks senior notes and certain other securities or financial arrangements adversely affect the interest rates paid or received on the revenue and expenses associated with or the value of other securities or financial arrangements given libors role in determining market interest rates globally prompt inquiries or other actions from regulators in respect of huntingtons preparation and readiness for the replacement of libor with an alternative reference rate and result in disputes litigation or other actions with counterparties regarding the interpretation and enforceability of certain fallback language in liborbased contracts and securities huntington implemented a libor transition plan in as of december the company ceased issuance of new libor loans alternative reference rates at this time are predominantly sofrbased systems products and analytics have been effectively transitioned away from libor and are utilizing alternative reference rates remaining libor transition project activities include remediation of remaining libor products including acquired products from tcf by june of we continue to assess the impact on our customers with any needed libor exceptions escalated to elt for approval the manner and impact of the transition from libor to an alternative reference rate as well as the effect of these developments on our funding costs loan and investment and trading securities portfolios assetliability management and business is uncertain liquidity risks changes in huntingtons financial condition or in the general banking industry or changes in interest rates could result in a loss of depositor confidence liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost the bank uses its liquidity to extend credit and to repay liabilities as they become due or as demanded by customers our primary source of liquidity is our large supply of deposits from consumer and commercial customers the continued availability of this supply depends on customer willingness to maintain deposit balances with banks in general and us in particular the availability of deposits can also be impacted by regulatory changes eg changes in fdic insurance liquidity requirements etc changes in the financial condition of huntington other banks or the banking industry in general changes in the interest rates our competitors pay on their deposits and other events which can impact the perceived safety or economic benefits of bank deposits while we make significant efforts to consider and plan for hypothetical disruptions in our deposit funding marketrelated geopolitical or other events could impact the liquidity derived from deposits we are a holding company and depend on dividends by our subsidiaries for most of our funds huntington is an entity separate and distinct from the bank the bank conducts most of our operations and huntington depends upon dividends from the bank to service huntingtons debt and to pay dividends to huntingtons shareholders the availability of dividends from the bank is limited by various statutes and regulations it is possible depending upon the financial condition including liquidity and capital adequacy of the bank and other factors that the occ could limit the payment of dividends or other payments to huntington by the bank in addition the payment of dividends by our other subsidiaries is also subject to the laws of the subsidiarys state of incorporation and regulatory capital and liquidity requirements applicable to such subsidiaries in the event that the bank was unable to pay dividends to us we in turn would likely have to reduce or stop paying dividends on our preferred and common stock our failure to pay dividends on our preferred and common stock could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our preferred and common stock additional information regarding dividend restrictions is provided in item business regulatory matters form 10k if we lose access to capital markets we may not be able to meet the cash flow requirements of our depositors creditors and borrowers or have the operating cash needed to fund corporate expansion and other corporate activities wholesale funding sources can include securitization federal funds purchased securities sold under repurchase agreements noncore deposits and longterm debt the bank is also a member of the fhlb which provides members access to funding through advances collateralized with mortgagerelated assets we maintain a portfolio of highlyrated marketable securities that is available as a source of liquidity capital markets disruptions can directly impact the liquidity of huntington and the bank the inability to access capital markets funding sources as needed could adversely impact our financial condition results of operations cash flows and level of regulatoryqualifying capital we may from timetotime consider using our existing liquidity position to opportunistically retire outstanding securities in privately negotiated or open market transactions a reduction in our credit rating could adversely affect our access to capital and could increase our cost of funds the credit rating agencies regularly evaluate huntington and the bank and credit ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and ability to generate earnings as well as factors not entirely within our control including conditions affecting the financial services industry the economy and changes in rating methodologies there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current credit ratings a downgrade of the credit ratings of huntington or the bank could adversely affect our access to liquidity and capital and could significantly increase our cost of funds trigger additional collateral or funding requirements and decrease the number of investors and counterparties willing to lend to us or purchase our securities this could affect our growth profitability and financial condition including liquidity instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters as well as volatility in financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition instability in global economic conditions and geopolitical matters as well as volatility in financial markets could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition the macroeconomic environment in the united states is susceptible to global events and volatility in financial markets for example trade negotiations between the us and other nations remain uncertain and could adversely impact economic and market conditions for the company and its clients and counterparties in addition global demand for products may exceed supply during the economic recovery from the covid19 pandemic and such shortages may cause prolonged inflation adversely impact consumer and business confidence and adversely affect the economy as well as our financial condition and results huntington bancshares incorporated operational risks our operational or security systems or infrastructure or those of third parties could fail or be breached which could disrupt our business and adversely impact our operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause legal or reputational harm the potential for operational risk exposure exists throughout our business and as a result of our interactions with and reliance on third parties is not limited to our own internal operational functions our operational and security systems and infrastructure including our computer systems data management and internal processes as well as those of third parties are integral to our performance we rely on our employees and third parties in our daytoday and ongoing operations who may as a result of human error misconduct malfeasance failure or breach of our or of thirdparty systems or infrastructure expose us to risk for example our ability to conduct business may be adversely affected by any significant disruptions to us or to third parties with whom we interact or upon whom we rely our financial accounting data processing backup or other operating or security systems and infrastructure may fail to operate properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control which could adversely affect our ability to process transactions or provide services such events may include sudden increases in customer transaction volume electrical telecommunications or other major physical infrastructure outages disease pandemics cyberattacks and events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including wars and terrorist attacks additional events beyond our control that could impact our business directly or indirectly include natural disasters such as earthquakes and weather events including tornadoes hurricanes and floods neither the occurrence nor the potential impact of these events can be predicted and the frequency and severity of weather events may be impacted by climate changes in addition we may need to take our systems offline if they become infected with malware or a computer virus or as a result of another form of cyberattack in the event that backup systems are utilized they may not process data as quickly as our primary systems and some data might not have been saved to backup systems potentially resulting in a temporary or permanent loss of such data in addition our ability to implement backup systems and other safeguards with respect to thirdparty systems is more limited than with respect to our own systems we frequently update our systems to support our operations and growth and to remain compliant with applicable laws rules and regulations this updating entails significant costs and creates risks associated with implementing new systems and integrating them with existing ones including business interruptions implementation and testing of controls related to our computer systems security monitoring and retaining and training personnel required to operate our systems also entail significant costs operational risk exposures could adversely impact our operations liquidity and financial condition as well as cause reputational harm in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a major interruption we face security risks including denial of service attacks hacking social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers malware intrusion or data corruption attempts and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information adversely affect our business or reputation and create significant legal and financial exposure our computer systems and network infrastructure and those of third parties on which we are highly dependent are subject to security risks and could be susceptible to cyberattacks such as denial of service attacks hacking terrorist activities or identity theft our business relies on the secure processing transmission storage and retrieval of confidential proprietary and other information in our computer and data management systems and networks and in the computer and data management systems and networks of third parties in addition to access our network products and services our customers and other third parties may use personal mobile devices or computing devices that are outside of our network environment and are subject to their own cybersecurity risks form 10k we our customers regulators and other third parties including other financial services institutions and companies engaged in data processing have been subject to and are likely to continue to be the target of cyberattacks these cyberattacks include computer viruses malicious or destructive code phishing attacks denial of service or information ransomware improper access by employees or vendors attacks on personal email of employees ransom demands to not expose security vulnerabilities in our systems or the systems of third parties or other security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of confidential proprietary and other information of ours our employees our customers or of third parties damage our systems or otherwise materially disrupt our or our customers or other third parties network access or business operations as cyberthreats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our protective measures or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities or incidents despite efforts to ensure the integrity of our systems and implement controls processes policies and other protective measures we may not be able to anticipate all security breaches nor may we be able to implement sufficient preventive measures against such security breaches which may result in material losses or consequences for us cybersecurity risks for banking organizations have significantly increased in recent years in part because of the proliferation of new technologies and the use of the internet and telecommunications technologies to conduct financial transactions for example cybersecurity risks may increase in the future as we continue to increase our mobilepayment and other internetbased product offerings and expand our internal usage of webbased products and applications in addition cybersecurity risks have significantly increased in recent years in part due to the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime affiliates terrorist organizations hostile foreign governments disgruntled employees or vendors activists and other external parties including those involved in corporate espionage even the most advanced internal control environment may be vulnerable to compromise due to increasing geopolitical tensions nation state cyberattacks and ransomware are both increasing in sophistication and prevalence targeted social engineering and email attacks ie spear phishing attacks are becoming more sophisticated and are extremely difficult to prevent in such an attack an attacker will attempt to fraudulently induce colleagues customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to our data or that of our clients persistent attackers may succeed in penetrating defenses given enough resources time and motive the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and may not be recognized until well after a breach has occurred the speed at which new vulnerabilities are discovered and exploited often before security patches are published continues to rise remote work further increases the risk that we may experience cyber incidents as a result of our employees vendors and other third parties with which we interact working remotely on less secure systems and environments the risk of a security breach caused by a cyberattack at a vendor or by unauthorized vendor access has also increased in recent years additionally the existence of cyberattacks or security breaches at thirdparty vendors with access to our data may not be disclosed to us in a timely manner further our ability to monitor our vendors cybersecurity practices is limited although we generally have agreements relating to cybersecurity and data privacy in place with our vendors we cannot guarantee that such agreements will prevent a cyberincident impacting our systems or information or enable us to obtain adequate or any reimbursement from our service providers in the event we should suffer any such incidents due to applicable laws and regulations or contractual obligations we may be held responsible for cyberincidents attributed to our vendors as they relate to the information we share with them we also face indirect technology cybersecurity and operational risks relating to the customers clients and other third parties with whom we do business or upon whom we rely to facilitate or enable our business activities including for example financial counterparties regulators and providers of critical infrastructure such as internet access and electrical power as a result of increasing consolidation interdependence and complexity of financial entities and technology systems a technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach that significantly degrades deletes or compromises the systems or data of one or more financial entities could have a material impact on counterparties or other market participants including us this consolidation interconnectivity and complexity increases the risk of operational failure any thirdparty technology failure cyberattack or other information or security breach termination or constraint could among other things adversely affect our ability to effect transactions service our clients manage our exposure to risk or expand our business huntington bancshares incorporated cyberattacks or other information or security breaches whether directed at us or third parties may result in a material loss or have material consequences furthermore the public perception that a cyberattack on our systems has been successful whether or not this perception is correct may damage our reputation with customers and third parties with whom we do business hacking of personal information and identity theft risks in particular could cause serious reputational harm a successful penetration or circumvention of system security could cause us serious negative consequences including our loss of customers and business opportunities costs associated with maintaining business relationships after an attack or breach significant business disruption to our operations and business misappropriation exposure or destruction of our confidential information intellectual property funds andor those of our customers or damage to our or our customers andor third parties computers or systems and could result in a violation of applicable privacy laws and other laws litigation exposure regulatory fines penalties or intervention loss of confidence in our security measures reputational damage reimbursement or other compensatory costs additional compliance costs and could adversely impact our results of operations liquidity and financial condition in addition we may not have adequate insurance coverage to compensate for losses from a cybersecurity event cybersecurity and data privacy are areas of heightened legislative and regulatory focus as cybersecurity and data privacy risks for banking organizations and the broader financial system have significantly increased in recent years cybersecurity and data privacy issues have become the subject of increasing legislative and regulatory focus the federal bank regulatory agencies have proposed regulations that would enhance cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide range of large financial institutions and their thirdparty service providers including us and the bank and would focus on cyber risk governance and management management of internal and external dependencies and incident response cyber resilience and situational awareness several states have also proposed or adopted cybersecurity legislation and regulations which require among other things notification to affected individuals when there has been a security breach of their personal data for more information regarding cybersecurity and data privacy refer to item business regulatory matters we receive maintain and store nonpublic personal information of our customers and counterparties including but not limited to personally identifiable information and personal financial information the sharing use disclosure and protection of these types of information are governed by federal and state law both personally identifiable information and personal financial information are increasingly subject to legislation and regulation the intent of which is to protect the privacy of personal information and personal financial information that is collected and handled for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds numerous other states have also enacted or are in the process of enacting statelevel privacy data protection andor data security laws and regulations for more information regarding data privacy laws and regulations refer to item business regulatory matters further we make public statements about our use collection disclosure and other processing of personal information through our privacy policies information provided on our website and press statements although we endeavor to comply with our public statements and documentation we may at times fail to do so or be alleged to have failed to do so the publication of our privacy policies and other statements that provide promises and assurances about privacy data protection and data security can subject us to potential government or legal action if they are found to be deceptive unfair or misrepresentative of our actual practices we may become subject to new legislation or regulation concerning cybersecurity or the privacy of personally identifiable information and personal financial information or of any other information we may store or maintain we could be adversely affected if new legislation or regulations are adopted or if existing legislation or regulations are modified such that we are required to alter our systems or require changes to our business practices or privacy policies if cybersecurity data privacy data protection data transfer or data retention laws are implemented interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our current practices we may be subject to fines litigation or regulatory enforcement actions or ordered to change our business practices policies or systems in a manner that adversely impacts our operating results form 10k we face significant operational risks which could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and capital markets we are exposed to many types of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by colleagues or outsiders unauthorized transactions by colleagues or outsiders operational errors by colleagues business disruption and system failures huntington executes against a significant number of controls a large percent of which are manual and dependent on adequate execution by colleagues and thirdparty service providers there is inherent risk that unknown single points of failure through the execution chain could give rise to material loss through inadvertent errors or malicious attack these operational risks could lead to financial loss expensive litigation and loss of confidence by our customers regulators and the capital markets moreover negative public opinion can result from our actual or alleged conduct in any number of activities including clients products and business practices corporate governance acquisitions and from actions taken by government regulators and community organizations in response to those activities negative public opinion can adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers and can also expose us to litigation and regulatory action relative to acquisitions we incur risks and challenges associated with the integration of employees accounting systems and technology platforms from acquired businesses and institutions in a timely and efficient manner and we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in retaining existing customer relationships or achieving anticipated operating efficiencies expected from such acquisitions acquisitions may be subject to the receipt of approvals from certain governmental authorities including the federal reserve the occ and the united states department of justice as well as the approval of our shareholders and the shareholders of companies that we seek to acquire these approvals for acquisitions may not be received may take longer than expected or may impose conditions that are not presently anticipated or that could have an adverse effect on the combined company following the acquisitions subject to requisite regulatory approvals future business acquisitions may result in the issuance and payment of additional shares of stock which would dilute current shareholders ownership interests additionally acquisitions may involve the payment of a premium over book and market values therefore dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share could occur in connection with any future transaction failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting could impair our ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price effective internal controls over financial reporting are necessary to provide reliable financial reports and prevent fraud we are subject to regulation that focuses on effective internal controls and procedures such controls and procedures are modified supplemented and changed from timetotime as necessitated by our growth and in reaction to external events and developments any failure to maintain an effective internal control environment could impact our ability to report our financial results on an accurate and timely basis which could result in regulatory actions loss of investor confidence and an adverse impact on our business and our stock price we rely on quantitative models to measure risks and to estimate certain financial values quantitative models may be used to help manage certain aspects of our business and to assist with certain business decisions including estimating expected lifetime credit losses measuring the fair value of financial instruments when reliable market prices are unavailable estimating the effects of changing interest rates and other market measures on our financial condition and results of operations managing risk and for capital planning purposes including during the ccar capital planning and capital adequacy process our measurement methodologies rely on many assumptions historical analyses and correlations these assumptions may not capture or fully incorporate conditions leading to losses particularly in times of market distress and the historical correlations on which we rely may no longer be relevant additionally as businesses and markets evolve our measurements may not accurately reflect this evolution even if the underlying assumptions and historical correlations used in our models are adequate our models may be deficient due to errors in computer code inaccurate data misuse of data or the use of a model for a purpose outside the scope of the models design huntington bancshares incorporated all models have certain limitations reliance on models presents the risk that our business decisions based on information incorporated from models will be adversely affected due to incorrect missing or misleading information in addition our models may not capture or fully express the risks we face may suggest that we have sufficient capitalization when we do not or may lead us to misjudge the business and economic environment in which we will operate if our models fail to produce reliable results on an ongoing basis we may not make appropriate risk management capital planning or other business or financial decisions strategies that we employ to manage and govern the risks associated with our use of models may not be effective or fully reliable also information that we provide to the public or regulators based on poorly designed models could be inaccurate or misleading banking regulators continue to focus on the models used by banks and bank holding companies in their businesses some of our decisions that the regulators evaluate including distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to their perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information are insufficient we rely on third parties to provide key components of our business infrastructure we rely on thirdparty service providers to leverage subject matter expertise and industry best practice provide enhanced products and services and reduce costs although there are benefits in entering into thirdparty relationships with vendors and others there are risks associated with such activities when entering a thirdparty relationship the risks associated with that activity are not passed to the thirdparty but remain our responsibility the technology committee of the board of directors provides oversight related to the overall risk management process associated with thirdparty relationships management is accountable for the review and evaluation of all new and existing thirdparty relationships management is responsible for ensuring that adequate controls are in place to protect us and our customers from the risks associated with vendor relationships increased risk could occur based on poor planning oversight control and inferior performance or service on the part of the thirdparty and may result in legal costs or loss of business while we have implemented a vendor management program to actively manage the risks associated with the use of thirdparty service providers any problems caused by thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers and to conduct our business replacing a thirdparty service provider could also take a long period of time and result in increased expenses changes in accounting policies standards and interpretations could affect how we report our financial condition and results of operations the fasb regulatory agencies and other bodies that establish accounting standards periodically change the financial accounting and reporting standards governing the preparation of our financial statements additionally those bodies that establish and interpret the accounting standards such as the fasb sec and banking regulators may change prior interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied for further discussion see note accounting standards update to the consolidated financial statements form 10k impairment of goodwill could require charges to earnings which could result in a negative impact on our results of operations our goodwill could become impaired in the future if goodwill were to become impaired it could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to huntington adversely impacting huntington liquidity and ability to pay dividends or repay debt assumptions affecting our goodwill impairment evaluation include earnings projections the discount rates used in the income approach to measure fair value and observed peer multiples used in estimating the fair value under the market approach we are required to test goodwill for impairment at least annually or when impairment indicators are present if an impairment determination is made in a future reporting period our earnings and book value of goodwill will be reduced by the amount of the impairment if an impairment loss is recorded it will have little or no impact on the tangible book value of our common stock or our regulatory capital levels but such an impairment loss could significantly reduce the banks earnings and thereby restrict the banks ability to make dividend payments to us without prior regulatory approval because federal reserve policy states the bank holding company dividends should be paid from current earnings at december the book value of our goodwill was billion substantially all of which was recorded at the bank any such write down of goodwill or other acquisition related intangibles will reduce huntingtons earnings as well climate change manifesting as physical or transition risks could adversely affect our operations businesses and customers there is an increasing concern over the risks of climate change and related environmental sustainability matters the physical risks of climate change include discrete events such as flooding and wildfires and longerterm shifts in climate patterns such as extreme heat sea level rise and more frequent and prolonged drought under medium or longerterm scenarios such events if uninterrupted or unaddressed could disrupt our operations or those of our customers or third parties on which we rely including through direct damage to assets and indirect impacts from supply chain disruption and market volatility additionally transitioning to a lowcarbon economy may entail extensive policy legal technology and market initiatives transition risks including changes in consumer preferences and additional regulatory requirements or supervisory expectations or taxes could increase our expenses and undermine our strategies in addition our reputation and client relationships may be damaged as a result of our practices related to climate change including our involvement or our customers involvement in certain industries or projects in the absence of mitigation andor transition measures associated with causing or exacerbating climate change as well as any decisions we make to continue to conduct or change our activities in response to considerations relating to climate change as climate risk is interconnected with all key risk types we have established a formal climate risk program to embed climate risk considerations into our risk management processes across all established risk pillars such as market credit and operational risks while the timing and severity of climate change may not be entirely predictable and our risk management processes may not be effective in mitigating climate risk exposure we continue to build capabilities to identify assess and manage climate risks the effects of covid19 have adversely impacted our operations and financial performance and it or a similar health crisis or pandemic could have similar adverse impacts in future periods although us and global economies have begun to recover from the covid19 pandemic as many health and safety restrictions have been lifted and vaccine distribution has increased certain adverse consequences of the pandemic including labor shortages disruptions of global supply chains and inflationary pressures continue to impact the macroeconomic environment and could adversely affect our business the pandemic has caused us and could continue to cause us to recognize credit losses in our loan portfolios and increases in our allowance for credit losses should the effects of the pandemic continue for an extended period of time or worsen furthermore the pandemic could cause us to recognize impairment of our goodwill and our financial assets sustained adverse effects may also increase our cost of capital prevent us from satisfying our minimum regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory requirements or

requirements topics related to social equity executive compensation and increased capital and liquidity as well as limits on share buybacks and dividends in addition mergers and acquisitions could be
