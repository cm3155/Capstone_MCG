understanding our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations and cash flows the mda included in our annual report on s with the sec the mda included in our annual report on and discharge situations a debtor is considered to be experiencing financial difficulty when there is significant doubt about the debtors ability to make required payments on the debt or to get equivalent financing from another creditor at a market rate for similar debt a loan placed on nonaccrual because the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty may be returned to accrual status when all contractually due interest and principal has been paid and the borrower demonstrates the financial capacity to continue to pay as agreed with the risk of loss diminished reported modification types modifications in the form of principal forgiveness an interest rate reduction an other than insignificant payment delay or a term extension that have occurred in the current reporting period to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty are disclosed along with the financial impact of the modifications huntington bancshares incorporated huntington will generally try other forms of relief before principal forgiveness but would define any contractual reduction in the amount of principal due without receiving payment or assets as forgiveness for the purpose of the disclosure huntington considers any contractual change in interest rate that results in the borrower receiving a below market rate to be an interest rate reduction many factors can go into what is considered an other than insignificant payment delay such as the significance of the restructured payment amount relative to the normal loan payment or the relative significance of the delay to the original loan terms generally huntington would consider any delay in payment of greater than days in the last months to be significant for the purpose of the disclosure modification of contingent payment features or covenants that would have accelerated payment are not considered term extensions following is a description of what is considered a borrower experiencing financial difficulty by the different loan types commercial loan modifications our strategy involving commercial borrowers generally includes working with these borrowers to allow them time to improve their financial position and remain a huntington customer through restructuring their notes or to restructure elsewhere if necessary borrowers that are rated substandard or worse in accordance with the regulatory definition or that cannot otherwise restructure at market terms and conditions are considered to be experiencing financial difficulty a subsequent restructuring or modification of a loan may occur when either the loan matures according to the terms of the modified agreement or the borrower requests a change to the loan agreements it is subjected to the normal underwriting standards and processes for other similar credit extensions both new and existing the restructured note is evaluated to determine if it is considered a new loan or a continuation of the prior loan consumer loan modifications consumer loans in which a borrower requires a modification as a result of negative changes to their financial condition or to avoid default generally indicate the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty the primary modifications made to consumer loans are amortization maturity date and interest rate changes consumer borrowers identified as experiencing financial difficulty are unable to refinance their loans through the companys normal origination channels or through other independent sources most but not all of the loans may be delinquent the companys primary loan categories that receive modifications are residential mortgage automobile home equity rv and marine and other consumer loans impact on credit quality of borrowers experiencing financial difficulty huntingtons alll is influenced by loan level characteristics that inform the assessed propensity to default as such the provision for credit losses is impacted primarily by changes in such loan level characteristics such as payment performance commercial borrowers experiencing financial difficulty are risk rated to reflect the increase in default characteristics so that that the alll reflects the future risk of loss borrowers experiencing financial difficulty can be classified as either accrual or nonaccrual loans form 10q the following table summarizes the amortized cost basis of loans modified during the reporting period

at september at december contract amount representing credit risk commitments to extend credit commercial consumer commercial real estate standby letters of credit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds commercial letters of credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature collateral to secure any funding of these commitments predominately consists of residential and commercial real estate mortgage loans standby lettersofcredit and guarantees on industrial revenue bonds are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years since the conditions under which huntington is required to fund these commitments may not materialize the cash requirements are expected to be less than the total outstanding commitments the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was million and million at

than days the goods or cargo being traded normally secure these instruments litigation and regulatory matters in the ordinary course of business huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines or penalties related to each matter may be huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established form 10q for certain matters huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss in cases in which huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below there may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible for those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible management currently estimates the aggregate range of reasonably possible loss is to million at september in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters this estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate the estimated range of possible loss does not represent huntingtons maximum loss exposure based on current knowledge management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of huntington further management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address huntingtons contingent liabilities however in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters some of which are beyond huntingtons control and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to huntingtons results of operations for any
