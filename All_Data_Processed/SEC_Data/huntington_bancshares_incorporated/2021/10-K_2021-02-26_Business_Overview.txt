november the federal reserve adopted a new rating system the lfi rating system to align its supervisory rating system for large financial institutions including huntington with its current supervisory programs for these firms as compared to the rating system it replaces which will continue to be used for smaller bhcs the lfi rating system places a greater emphasis on capital and liquidity including related planning and risk management practices huntington received its first rating under the lfi rating system in these ratings will remain confidential bank acquisitions by huntington bhcs such as huntington must obtain prior approval of the federal reserve in connection with any acquisition that results in the bhc owning or controlling or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or another bhc acquisitions of ownership of the company acquisitions of huntingtons voting stock above certain thresholds are subject to prior regulatory notice or approval under federal banking laws including the bhc act and the change in bank control act of under the change in bank control act a person or entity generally must provide prior notice to the federal reserve before form 10k acquiring

requirement that the bhc not control prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or unless the acquisition is the bhcs initial entry into the state more than of such deposits in the state or such lesser or greater amount set by the state the riegleneal act also authorizes banks to merge across state lines thereby creating interstate branches a national bank such as the bank with the approval of the occ may open a branch in any state if the law of that state would permit a state bank chartered in that state to establish the branch regulatory capital requirements huntington and the bank are subject to certain riskbased capital and leverage ratio requirements under the us basel iii capital rules adopted by the federal reserve for huntington and by the occ for the bank these rules implement the basel iii international regulatory capital standards in the united states as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner under the us basel iii capital rules huntingtons and the banks assets exposures and certain offbalance sheet items are subject to risk weights used to determine the institutions riskweighted assets these riskweighted assets are used to calculate the following minimum capital ratios for huntington and the bank cet1 riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets cet1 capital primarily includes common shareholders equity subject to certain regulatory adjustments and deductions including goodwill intangible assets certain deferred tax assets and aoci effective april huntington and the bank adopted rules issued by regulators that simplified the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that an institution could not realize through net operating loss carrybacks and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as simplified the recognition and calculation of minority interests that are includable in regulatory capital tier riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital is primarily comprised of cet1 capital perpetual preferred stock and certain qualifying capital instruments total riskbased capital ratio equal to the ratio of total capital including cet1 capital tier capital and tier capital to riskweighted assets tier capital primarily includes qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying alll tier capital also includes among other things certain trust preferred securities tier leverage ratio equal to the ratio of tier capital to quarterly average assets net of goodwill certain other intangible assets and certain other deductions in december the us federal banking agencies finalized rules that permit bhcs and banks to phasein the dayone retained earnings impact of the new cecl accounting rule over a period of three years for regulatory capital purposes as part of its response to the impact of covid19 the us federal banking agencies issued another final rule that provides the option to temporarily delay certain effects of cecl on regulatory capital for two years followed by a threeyear transition period beginning january the final rule allows bhcs and banks to delay for two years of the dayone impact of adopting cecl and of the cumulative change in the reported allowance for credit losses since adopting cecl huntington and the bank have elected to adopt this final rule for further discussion of the new cecl accounting rule see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements in august the us federal banking agencies adopted a final rule altering the definition of eligible retained income in their respective capital rules under the new rule eligible retained income is the greater of a firms i net income over the four preceding calendar quarters net of any distributions and associated tax effects not already huntington bancshares incorporated reflected in net income and ii average net income over the preceding four quarters this definition applies with respect to all of huntingtons capital requirements the total minimum regulatory capital ratios and wellcapitalized minimum ratios are reflected on the following page the federal reserve has not yet revised the wellcapitalized standard for bhcs to reflect the higher capital requirements imposed under the us basel iii capital rules for purposes of the federal reserves regulation y including determining whether a bhc meets the requirements to be an fhc bhcs such as huntington must maintain a tier riskbased capital ratio of or greater and a total riskbased capital ratio of or greater if the federal reserve were to apply the same or a very similar wellcapitalized standard to bhcs as that applicable to the bank huntingtons capital ratios as of december would exceed such revised wellcapitalized standard the federal reserve may require bhcs including huntington to maintain capital ratios substantially in excess of mandated minimum levels depending upon general economic conditions and a bhcs particular condition risk profile and growth plans failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could result in certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary actions by regulators that if undertaken could have an adverse material effect on our operations or financial condition failure to be wellcapitalized or to meet minimum capital requirements could also result in restrictions on huntingtons or the banks ability to pay dividends or otherwise distribute capital or to receive regulatory approval of applications in addition to meeting the minimum capital requirements under the us basel iii capital rules huntington and the bank must also maintain the required stress capital buffer and capital conservation buffer respectively to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions and certain discretionary bonus payments to management the capital conservation buffer is and is calculated as a ratio of cet1 capital to riskweighted assets and it effectively increases the required minimum riskbased capital ratios the tier leverage ratio is not impacted by the capital conservation buffer and a banking institution may be considered wellcapitalized while remaining out of compliance with the capital conservation buffer in march the federal reserve issued a final rule that among other things replaced the capital conservation buffer with stress buffer requirements for certain large bhcs including huntington please refer to the stress buffer requirements section below for further details the following table presents the minimum regulatory capital ratios minimum ratio plus capital conservation buffer and wellcapitalized minimums compared with huntingtons and the banks regulatory capital ratios as of december calculated using

reflects a stress capital buffer of for huntington and the capital conservation buffer of for the bank reflects the wellcapitalized standard applicable to huntington under federal reserve regulation y and the wellcapitalized standard applicable to the bank huntington has the ability to provide additional capital to the bank to maintain the banks riskbased capital ratios at levels which would be considered wellcapitalized as of december huntingtons and the banks regulatory capital ratios were above the wellcapitalized standards and met the stress capital buffer and the capital conservation buffer respectively form 10k liquidity requirements under the capital and liquidity tailoring rule huntington as a category iv banking organization is exempt from the lcr but will continue to be subject to internal liquidity stress tests and standards enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act as modified by the economic growth act bhcs with consolidated assets of more than billion such as huntington are currently subject to certain enhanced prudential standards as a result huntington is subject to more stringent standards including liquidity and capital requirements leverage limits stress testing resolution planning and risk management standards than those applicable to smaller institutions certain larger banking organizations are subject to additional enhanced prudential standards a rule to implement one additional enhanced prudential standardearly remediation requirementsis still under consideration by the federal reserve in june the federal reserve adopted a final rule that established single counterparty credit limits the single counterparty credit limits do not apply to bhcs like huntington that do not have at least billion of total consolidated assets as discussed in the regulatory environment section above under the eps tailoring rule huntington as a category iv banking organization is subject to the least restrictive enhanced prudential standards applicable to firms with billion or more in total consolidated assets as compared to enhanced prudential standards that were applicable to huntington under the eps tailoring rule huntington is no longer subject to companyrun stress testing requirements and is subject to supervisory stress tests every other year as opposed to annually less frequent internal liquidity stress tests and reduced liquidity risk management requirements future rules to implement the economic growth act may further change the enhanced prudential standards applicable to huntington capital planning and stress testing huntington is required to develop maintain and submit to the federal reserve a capital plan every other year for supervisory review in connection with its ccar process huntington is required to include within its capital plan an assessment of the expected uses and sources of capital and a description of all planned capital actions over the ninequarter planning horizon a detailed description of the process for assessing capital adequacy its capital policy and a discussion of any expected changes to its business plan that are likely to have a material impact on its capital adequacy under the stress buffer requirements final rule adopted in march the ccar process is used to determine a bhcs stress capital buffer requirement please refer to the stress buffer requirements section below for further details the federal reserve expects bhcs subject to ccar such as huntington to have sufficient capital to withstand a highly adverse operating environment and to be able to continue operations maintain ready access to funding meet obligations to creditors and counterparties and serve as credit intermediaries in addition the federal reserve evaluates the planned capital actions of these bhcs including planned capital distributions such as dividend payments or stock repurchases this involves a quantitative assessment of capital based on supervisoryrun stress tests that assess the ability to maintain capital levels above certain minimum ratios after taking all capital actions included in a bhcs capital plan under baseline and stressful conditions throughout the ninequarter planning horizon as part of ccar the federal reserve evaluates whether bhcs have sufficient capital to continue operations throughout times of economic and financial market stress and whether they have robust forwardlooking capital planning processes that account for their unique risks we are generally prohibited from making a capital distribution unless after giving effect to the distribution we will meet all minimum regulatory capital ratios under the stress buffer requirements final rule adopted in march bhcs including huntington may increase their capital distributions in excess of the amount included in their capital plan without seeking prior approval from the federal reserve as long as the bhc otherwise complies with the automatic restrictions on distributions under the federal reserves capital rules huntington bancshares incorporated under revised ccar rules that became effective on march the federal reserve is no longer allowed to object to the capital plan of a large and noncomplex bhc such as huntington on a qualitative as opposed to quantitative basis instead the federal reserve may evaluate the strength of huntingtons qualitative capital planning process through the regular supervisory process and targeted horizontal reviews of particular aspects of capital planning in addition under the stress buffer requirements final rule adopted in march the federal reserve may no longer object to capital plans of bhcs including huntington on a quantitative basis please refer to the stress buffer requirements section below for further details during the fourth quarter of certain large bhcs including huntington were required to update and resubmit their capital plans to reflect ongoing stresses caused by the covid19 pandemic we conducted a second round of stress tests and submitted our updated capital plan to the federal reserve in november on december the federal reserve released the results of its second round of supervisory stress tests while the federal reserve did not recalculate our stress capital buffer requirement at this time they have the ability to do so until march stress buffer requirements in march the federal reserve issued a final rule to integrate its annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with certain ongoing regulatory capital requirements the final rule applies to certain bhcs including huntington and introduces a stress capital buffer and related changes to the capital planning and stress testing processes for riskbased capital requirements the stress capital buffer replaces the existing capital conservation buffer which was as of january under the final rule beginning in the ccar cycle huntington will be required to calculate a stress capital buffer equal to the greater of i the difference between its starting and minimum projected cet1 riskbased capital ratio under the severely adverse scenario in the supervisory stress test plus the sum of the dollar amount of huntingtons planned common stock dividends for each of the fourth through seventh quarters of the planning horizon as a percentage of riskweighted assets or ii as of december huntingtons stress capital buffer is the final rule also makes related changes to the capital planning and stress testing process among other changes the revised capital plan rule eliminates the assumption that huntingtons balance sheet assets would increase over the planning horizon in addition provided that huntington is otherwise in compliance with automatic restrictions on distributions under the federal reserves capital rules huntington will no longer be required to seek prior approval to make capital distributions in excess of those included in its capital plan restrictions on dividends huntington is a legal entity separate and distinct from its banking and nonbanking subsidiaries since our consolidated net income consists largely of net income of huntingtons subsidiaries our ability to make capital distributions including paying dividends and repurchasing shares depends upon our receipt of dividends from these subsidiaries under federal law there are various limitations on the extent to which the bank can declare and pay dividends to huntington including those related to regulatory capital requirements general regulatory oversight to prevent unsafe or unsound practices and federal banking law requirements concerning the payment of dividends out of net profits surplus and available earnings certain contractual restrictions also may limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to huntington no assurances can be given that the bank will in any circumstances pay dividends to huntington huntingtons ability to declare and pay dividends to our shareholders is similarly limited by federal banking law and federal reserve regulations and policy as discussed in the capital planning section above a bhc may pay dividends and repurchase stock only in accordance with a capital plan that has been reviewed by the federal reserve and as to which the federal reserve has not objected the frb announced that certain large bhcs including huntington will be permitted to make both dividend and share repurchases during the first quarter of subject to limits based on the amount of dividends paid in the second quarter of and the banks average net income for the four preceding quarters huntington must maintain the applicable stress capital buffer and the bank must maintain the cet1 capital conservation buffer of to avoid becoming subject to restrictions on capital distributions including dividends form 10k for more information on the stress buffer requirements and the capital conservation buffer see the stress capital buffer requirements and the regulatory capital requirements sections above respectively federal reserve policy provides that a bhc generally should not pay dividends unless the bhcs net income over the last four quarters net of dividends paid is sufficient to fully fund the dividends the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the capital needs asset quality and overall financial condition of the bhc and its subsidiaries and the bhc will continue to meet minimum required capital adequacy ratios accordingly a bhc should not pay cash dividends that can only be funded in ways that weaken the bhcs financial health such as by borrowing a bhc should inform the federal reserve reasonably in advance of declaring or paying a dividend that exceeds earnings for the period for which the dividend is being paid or that could result in a material adverse change to the bhcs capital structure bhcs should also consult with the federal reserve before increasing dividends or redeeming or repurchasing capital instruments additionally the federal reserve could prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by a bhc if it determines that payment of the dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in response to the uncertainty caused by the covid19 pandemic certain large bhcs including huntington were not permitted to make share repurchases subject to certain limited exceptions during the third and fourth quarters of but were permitted to make dividend payments subject to limits based on the amount of dividends paid in the second quarter and the firms average net income over the preceding four quarters for the first quarter of provided that a bhc does not increase its common stock dividends higher than the level paid in the second quarter of bhcs including huntington are permitted to pay common dividends and make share repurchases that in the aggregate do not exceed an amount equal to the average of the firms net income over the four preceding calendar quarters bhcs may also make additional share repurchases up to the amount of share issuances related to expensed employee compensation volcker rule under the volcker rule we are prohibited from engaging in shortterm proprietary trading for our own account and having certain ownership interests in and relationships with hedge funds or private equity funds covered funds the volcker rule regulations contain exemptions for marketmaking hedging underwriting trading in us government and agency obligations and also permit certain ownership interests in certain types of covered funds to be retained they also permit the offering and sponsoring of covered funds under certain conditions the volcker rule regulations impose significant compliance and reporting obligations on banking entities such as huntington we have put in place the compliance programs required by the volcker rule and have either divested or received extensions for any holdings in illiquid covered funds the five federal agencies implementing the volcker rule regulations have approved an interim final rule to permit banking entities to retain interests in certain collateralized debt obligations backed primarily by trust preferred securities if certain qualifications are met in addition the agencies released a nonexclusive list of issuers that meet the requirements of the interim final rule as of december we had no investments in trust preferred securities as of october the five federal agencies with rulemaking authority with respect to the volcker rule finalized amendments to the proprietary trading provisions of the volcker rule these amendments tailor the volcker rules compliance requirements to the amount of a firms trading activity revise the definition of trading account clarify certain key provisions in the volcker rule and modify the information companies are required to provide the federal agencies these amendments to the volcker rule are not material to our investing and trading activities in june the five federal agencies finalized amendments to the volcker rules restrictions on ownership interests in and relationships with covered funds among other things these amendments permit banking entities to have relationships with and offer additional financial services to additional types of funds and investment vehicles these requirements are not expected to have a material impact on huntingtons investing and trading activities huntington bancshares incorporated recovery and resolution planning in past years huntington was required to submit annually to the federal reserve and the fdic a resolution plan for the orderly resolution of huntington and its significant legal entities under the us bankruptcy code or other applicable insolvency laws in a rapid and orderly fashion in the event of future material financial distress or failure in october the federal reserve and the fdic adopted amendments to their resolution planning rule and as a result of these amendments huntington is no longer required to submit a resolution plan to the federal reserve and the fdic the bank is required to periodically file a resolution plan with the fdic the public versions of the resolution plans previously submitted by huntington and the bank are available on the fdics website and in the case of huntingtons resolution plans also on the federal reserves website in april the fdic released an advanced notice of proposed rulemaking with respect to the fdics bank resolution plan requirements that requested comments on how to better tailor bank resolution plans to a firms size complexity and risk profile and delayed bank resolution plan submissions to the rulemaking process the fdic announced in january that it will resume requiring banklevel resolution plan submissions but will not require banks to submit resolution plans without at least months advance notice and as a result the bank does not currently have an anticipated submission date for its next resolution plan source of strength huntington is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to the bank and under appropriate conditions to commit resources to support the bank this support may be required by the federal reserve at times when we might otherwise determine not to provide it or when doing so is not otherwise in the interests of huntington or our shareholders or creditors the federal reserve may require a bhc to make capital injections into a troubled subsidiary bank and may charge the bhc with engaging in unsafe and unsound practices if the bhc fails to commit resources to such a subsidiary bank or if it undertakes actions that the federal reserve believes might jeopardize the bhcs ability to commit resources to such subsidiary bank under these requirements huntington may in the future be required to provide financial assistance to the bank should it experience financial distress capital loans by huntington to the bank would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of the bank in the event of huntingtons bankruptcy any commitment by huntington to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of the bank would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment fdic as receiver or conservator of huntington upon the insolvency of an insured depository institution such as the bank the fdic may be appointed as the conservator or receiver of the institution under the orderly liquidation authority upon the insolvency of a bhc such as huntington the fdic may be appointed as conservator or receiver of the bhc if certain findings are made by the fdic the federal reserve and the secretary of the treasury in consultation with the president acting as a conservator or receiver the fdic would have broad powers to transfer any assets or liabilities of the institution without the approval of the institutions creditors depositor preference the fdia provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution including the bank the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver would have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if the bank were to fail insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic would have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including huntington with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution transactions between a bank and its affiliates federal banking laws and regulations impose qualitative standards and quantitative limitations upon certain transactions between a bank and its affiliates including between a bank and its holding company and companies that the bhc may be deemed to control for these purposes transactions covered by these provisions must be on form 10k armslength terms and cannot exceed certain amounts which are determined with reference to the banks regulatory capital moreover if the transaction is a loan or other extension of credit it must be secured by collateral in an amount and quality expressly prescribed by statute and if the affiliate is unable to pledge sufficient collateral the bhc may be required to provide it the doddfrank act expanded the coverage and scope of these regulations including by applying them to the credit exposure arising under derivative transactions repurchase and reverse repurchase agreements and securities borrowing and lending transactions federal banking laws also place similar restrictions on loans and other extensions of credit by fdicinsured banks such as the bank and their subsidiaries to their directors executive officers and principal shareholders lending standards and guidance the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted uniform regulations prescribing standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate under these regulations all insured depository institutions such as the bank must adopt and maintain written policies establishing appropriate limits and standards for extensions of credit that are secured by liens or interests in real estate or are made for the purpose of financing permanent improvements to real estate these policies must establish loan portfolio diversification standards prudent underwriting standards including loantovalue limits that are clear and measurable loan administration procedures and documentation approval and reporting requirements the real estate lending policies must reflect consideration of the federal bank regulatory agencies interagency guidelines for real estate lending policies heightened governance and risk management standards the occ has published guidelines to set expectations for the governance and risk management practices of certain large financial institutions including the bank the guidelines require covered institutions to establish and adhere to a written governance framework in order to manage and control their risktaking activities in addition the guidelines provide standards for the institutions boards of directors to oversee the risk governance framework as discussed in the risk management and capital section of the mda the bank currently has a written governance framework and associated controls antimoney laundering the bank secrecy act and the patriot act contain antimoney laundering and financial transparency provisions intended to detect and prevent the use of the us financial system for money laundering and terrorist financing activities the bank secrecy act as amended by the patriot act requires depository institutions and their holding companies to undertake activities including maintaining an aml program verifying the identity of customers verifying the identity of certain beneficial owners for legal entity customers monitoring for and reporting suspicious transactions reporting on cash transactions exceeding specified thresholds and responding to requests for information by regulatory authorities and law enforcement agencies the bank is subject to the bank secrecy act and therefore is required to provide its employees with aml training designate an aml compliance officer and undergo an annual independent audit to assess the effectiveness of its aml program the bank has implemented policies procedures and internal controls that are designed to comply with these aml requirements bank regulators are focusing their examinations on aml compliance and we will continue to monitor and augment where necessary our aml compliance programs the federal banking agencies are required when reviewing bank and bhc acquisition or merger applications to take into account the effectiveness of the aml activities of the applicant the antimoney laundering act of enacted on january as part of the national defense authorization act does not directly impose new requirements on banks but requires the us treasury department to issue national antimoney laundering and countering the financing of terrorism priorities and conduct studies and issue regulations that may over the next few years significantly alter some of the due diligence recordkeeping and reporting requirements that the bank secrecy act and usa patriot act impose on banks the antimoney laundering act of also contains provisions that promote increased informationsharing and use of technology and increases penalties for violations of the bank secrecy act and includes whistleblower incentives both of which could increase the prospect of regulatory enforcement huntington bancshares incorporated ofac regulation ofac is responsible for administering economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others as defined by various executive orders and in various legislation ofacadministered sanctions take many different forms for example sanctions may include restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons ofac also publishes lists of persons organizations and countries suspected of aiding harboring or engaging in terrorist acts known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons blocked assets for example property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from ofac failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences data privacy federal and state law contains extensive consumer privacy protection provisions the glba requires financial institutions to periodically disclose their privacy policies and practices relating to sharing such information and enables retail customers to opt out of our ability to share information with unaffiliated third parties under certain circumstances other federal and state laws and regulations impact our ability to share certain information with affiliates and nonaffiliates for marketing andor nonmarketing purposes or to contact customers with marketing offers these security and privacy policies and procedures for the protection of personal and confidential information are in effect across all businesses and geographic locations as applicable federal law also makes it a criminal offense except in limited circumstances to obtain or attempt to obtain customer information of a financial nature by fraudulent or deceptive means data privacy and data protection are areas of increasing state legislative focus for example in june of the governor of california signed into law the ccpa the ccpa which became effective on january applies to forprofit businesses that conduct business in california and meet certain revenue or data collection thresholds the ccpa gives consumers the right to request disclosure of information collected about them and whether that information has been sold or shared with others the right to request deletion of personal information subject to certain exceptions the right to opt out of the sale of the consumers personal information and the right not to be discriminated against for exercising these rights the ccpa contains several exemptions including that many but not all requirements of the ccpa are inapplicable to information that is collected processed sold or disclosed pursuant to the glba california voters also recently passed the california privacy rights act which will take effect on january and significantly modifies the ccpa including imposing additional obligations on covered companies and expanding california consumers rights with respect to certain sensitive personal information potentially resulting in further uncertainty and requiring us to incur additional costs and expenses in an effort to comply in california the ccpa may be interpreted or applied in a manner inconsistent with our understanding or similar laws may be adopted by other states where we operate the federal government may also pass data privacy or data protection legislation like other lenders the bank and other of our subsidiaries use credit bureau data in their underwriting activities use of such data is regulated under the fcra and the fcra also regulates reporting information to credit bureaus prescreening individuals for credit offers sharing of information between affiliates and using affiliate data for marketing purposes similar state laws may impose additional requirements on us and our subsidiaries fdic insurance the dif provides insurance coverage for certain deposits up to a standard maximum deposit insurance amount of per depositor and is funded through assessments on insured depository institutions based on the risk each institution poses to the dif the bank accepts customer deposits that are insured by the dif and therefore must pay insurance premiums the fdic may increase the banks insurance premiums based on various factors including the fdics assessment of its risk profile form 10k the fdic issued a rule that requires large insured depository institutions including the bank to enhance their deposit account recordkeeping and related information technology system capabilities to facilitate prompt payment of insured deposits if such an institution were to fail the fdic has established an initial compliance date of april and allows each large insured depository institution to file for an optional extension of the compliance date for up to one year to a date no later than april huntington filed for the optional extension and certified its compliance to the fdic as required by the rule during fourth quarter as of june the dif reserve ratio fell to the fdic as required under the federal deposit insurance act established a plan on september to restore the dif reserve ratio to meet or exceed within eight years the fdics restoration plan projects the reserve ratio to exceed without increasing the deposit insurance assessment rate subject to ongoing monitoring over the next eight years the fdic could increase the deposit insurance assessments for certain insured depository institutions including the bank if the dif reserve ratio is not restored as projected compensation our compensation practices are subject to oversight by the federal reserve and with respect to some of our subsidiaries and employees by other financial regulatory bodies the scope and content of compensation regulation in the financial industry are continuing to develop and we expect that these regulations and resulting market practices will continue to evolve over a number of years the federal bank regulatory agencies have issued joint guidance on executive compensation designed to ensure that the incentive compensation policies of banking organizations such as huntington and the bank do not encourage imprudent risk taking and are consistent with the safety and soundness of the organization in addition the doddfrank act requires the federal bank regulatory agencies and the sec to issue regulations or guidelines requiring covered financial institutions including huntington and the bank to prohibit incentivebased payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing compensation that is excessive or that could lead to material financial loss to the institution a proposed rule was issued in also pursuant to the doddfrank act in the sec proposed rules that would direct stock exchanges to require listed companies to implement clawback policies to recover incentivebased compensation from current or former executive officers in the event of certain financial restatements and would also require companies to disclose their clawback policies and their actions under those policies huntington continues to evaluate the proposed rules both of which are subject to further rulemaking procedures cybersecurity the glba requires financial institutions to implement a comprehensive information security program that includes administrative technical and physical safeguards to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer records and information the cisa is intended to improve cybersecurity in the united states by enhanced sharing of information about security threats among the us government and private sector entities including financial institutions the cisa also authorizes companies to monitor their own systems notwithstanding any other provision of law and allows companies to carry out defensive measures on their own systems from cyberattacks the law includes liability protections for companies that share cyber threat information with third parties so long as such sharing activity is conducted in accordance with cisa in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued an anpr regarding enhanced cyber risk management standards which would apply to a wide
