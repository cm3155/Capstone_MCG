item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this mda provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations and cash flows the mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report the forwardlooking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions risks uncertainties and other factors including statements regarding our plans objectives goals strategies and financial performance our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forwardlooking statements and those set forth in item executive overview financial performance review in we reported net income of million a decrease from the prior year earnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year were down from the prior year fullytaxable equivalent net interest income for increased million from this reflected the impact of average earning asset growth and a growth of average interestbearing liabilities fte net interest margin decreased basis points to average earning asset growth reflects a billion or increase in average loans and leases the nim compression reflected an basis point decline in average earning asset yields a basis point decline in the benefit from noninterestbearing funds partially offset by a basis point decrease in average funding costs the provision for credit losses was billion up million or the increase in provision expense over the prior year was primarily attributed to the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment resulting from the covid19 pandemic and risk rating downgrades within the commercial portfolio noninterest income was billion up million or from the prior year among the primary drivers mortgage banking income increased million or primarily reflecting higher secondary marketing spreads and an increase in salable mortgage originations offsetting this increase service charges on deposit accounts decreased million or primarily reflecting reduced customer activity and pandemicrelated fee waivers and other noninterest income decreased million or reflecting several notable items impacting both periods as well as lower fixed income brokerage revenue deposit placement fees and operating lease income notable items in include a million gain on the annuitization of a retiree health plan and a million gain on the sale of the retirement plan services recordkeeping business whereas included a million gain from the sale of wisconsin retail branches noninterest expense was billion up million or from the prior year contributing to the increase personnel costs were up million or primarily reflecting increased salaries incentives commissions contract help and overtime expense partially offset by lower payroll taxes outside data processing and other services increased million or primarily driven by expenses related to technology investments equipment expense increased million driven by increased depreciation and software development expense offsetting these increases other noninterest expense decreased million or primarily as a result of lower travel and business development expenses partially offset by an increase in the contribution to the columbus foundation and discharge situations on march and april the federal bank regulatory agencies including the frb and occ released statements encouraging financial institutions to work prudently with borrowers that may be unable to meet their contractual obligations because of the effects of covid19 the statements go on to explain that in consultation with the fasb staff the federal bank regulatory agencies concluded that shortterm modifications eg six months made on a good faith basis to borrowers who were current as of the implementation date of a relief program are not tdrs section of the cares act as amended by section of the consolidated appropriations act of cares act further addresses covid19 related modifications occurring between march through january and specifies that such covid19 related modifications on loans that were current as of december are not tdrs for covid19 related loan modifications occurring during which met the loan modification criteria under the cares act huntington elected to suspend tdr accounting for loan modifications not eligible for the cares act huntington applied the interagency regulatory guidance that was clarified on april accordingly insignificant concessions related to the current covid19 crisis granted through payment deferrals fee waivers or other shortterm modifications generally months or less and provided to borrowers less than days past due at march s will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge commercial loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value by 90days past due with the exception of administrative small ticket lease delinquencies automobile loans rv and marine and other consumer loans are generally fully chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due the remaining balance is in delinquent status until a modification can be completed or the loan goes through the foreclosure process form 10k the

changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans huntington measures market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the huntington bancshares incorporated changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in huntingtons balance sheet huntington compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are instantaneous parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates huntington presumes that market rates cannot go below the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon table start table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december december na table end the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual ramp as defined above and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months as well as an instantaneous parallel shock of basis points with the continued decline in rates the down basis point ramp scenario can produce a distorted view of interest rate risks metrics as a result the down basis point ramp scenario was replaced with the down basis point shock scenario by the board as a policy metric beginning september management does consider additional scenarios with forecasted negative market rates which would result in margin deterioration the increase in sensitivity was driven by the impact of lower forecast rates on nonmaturity deposits resulting in slower balance runoff and higher securities prepayments in the implied forward scenario resulting in more opportunity for reinvestment at higher rates in rising rate environments additionally an increase in the securities portfolio and the hedge program have also resulted in increased sensitivity our nii at risk is within our board of directors policy limits for the and basis point scenarios the nii at risk shows that our balance sheet is asset sensitive at both december and december table start table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december december na table end the eve results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models immediate and basis point parallel shifts shocks as defined above in market interest rates with the continued decline in rates the down basis

policy metric beginning september management does consider additional scenarios with forecasted negative market rates to understand the impact on eve we are within our board of directors policy limits for the and basis point scenarios the eve depicts an asset sensitive balance sheet profile the change in sensitivity was driven primarily by lower interest rates slowing deposit runoff and to a lesser extent expected securities portfolio runoff we have liborbased exposure in the form of certain variable rate loans derivatives series b preferred stock long term debt and other securities and financial arrangements to address the discontinuance of libor in its current form we have established a libor transition team and project plan under the oversight of the cro and cfo form 10k providing periodic updates to the roc in reviewing the contract fallback language certain contracts were identified as needing updated provisions for transition the libor transition team is coordinating remediation where necessary our technology team has undertaken core loan servicing system projects to support alternative reference rates with some already operational and others with target project completion dates in the first half of additionally we have developed a sofrenabled interest rate risk monitoring framework and a strategy for managing interest rate risk during the transition from libor to sofr during the fourth quarter of huntington began indexing new retail adjustable rate mortgages to sofr secured overnight funding rate we continue to monitor market developments and regulatory updates including the recent announcements from the ice benchmark administrator to extend the cessation date for several usd libor tenors to june for a discussion of the risks associated with the libor transition to alternative reference rates refer to item risk factors use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is the use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps interest rate floors interest rate caps forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps huntington has entered into a number of interest rate derivative contracts to manage our interest rate risk position which are economic hedges ie do not receive hedge accounting treatment the impact of changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as economic hedges are reported in current period earnings while these interest rate derivatives are used to reduce the longterm interest rate sensitivity these economic hedges can result in shortterm volatility in net interest income as a result of the changes in interest rates table shows all swap floor and cap positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate the volume maturity and mix of portfolio derivative positions change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount and

consolidated financial statements on january huntington made an irrevocable election to subsequently measure all classes of residential msrs at fair value in order to eliminate any potential measurement mismatch between our economic hedges and the msrs the impact of the irrevocable election was not material at december we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report changes in the msr value net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income msr assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions derivative instruments and equity investments we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner liquidity is managed to ensure stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we rely on a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits liquidity risk is managed centrally by corporate treasury the position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into retail and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plans our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december we also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity including advances from the fhlb issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers liquidity is further provided by unencumbered or unpledged investment securities that totaled billion as of december the treasury department also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutionalspecific stress scenario an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality a large charge to earnings a decline in profitability or other financial measures or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an huntington bancshares incorporated evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period during huntington heightened its overall liquidity risk management process including additional communication monitoring and reporting given changes in the economic environment as a result of covid19 overnight funding markets continue to demonstrate ample liquidity with the ability to obtain shortterm funding we continue to closely monitor wholesale funding markets and all government sponsored programs in relation to huntingtons

enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements these arrangements include commitments to extend credit interest rate swaps and floors financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature see note commitments and contingent liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information interest rate swaps balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and

instruments of the notes to consolidated financial statements for more information standby lettersofcredit standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these

future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters failed business contingency plans and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats have increased primarily through covid19 themed phishing campaigns we are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns we have also increased our cybersecurity monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce is now working remotely our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality to mitigate operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and form 10k ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and remediation recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and the audit committee as appropriate significant findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the technology committee of the board as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational riskmonitoring techniques and strategies minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending andor other courses related to the extension of credit we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance capital this section should be read in conjunction with the regulatory matters section included in part i item business and note other regulatory matters of the notes to consolidated financial statements both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate the us federal banking regulatory agencies have permitted bhcs and banks to phasein for regulatory capital purposes the dayone impact of the new cecl accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years as part of its response to the impact of covid19 the us

basel iii capital ratios in excess of the wellcapitalized standards established by the frb the balance sheet growth impact on regulatory capital ratios was largely offset by a change in asset mix during related to ppp loans and elevated deposits at the federal reserve both of which are risk weighted the capital impact of earnings adjusted for the cecl transition was largely offset by the repurchase of million of common stock over the last four quarters primarily in the first quarter and cash dividends the regulatory tier riskbased capital and total riskbased capital ratios also

equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends and share repurchases other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled billion at december an increase of billion or when compared with december due to the issuance of million of series f preferred stock and

share on june we were notified by the frb that certain large bhcs including huntington were required to update and resubmit their capital plans because of changes in financial markets and the macroeconomic outlook that could have a material impact on the bhcs risk profile and financial condition required the use of updated scenarios on december we were notified by the frb that under both of the severely adverse and the alternative severely adverse economic stress scenarios in the supervisory stress tests our modeled capital ratios huntington bancshares incorporated would continue to exceed the minimum requirements under the frbs capital adequacy rules in addition the frb announced that they were extending through march the time period for the frb to notify certain large bhcs including huntington whether the frb will recalculate bhcs stress capital buffer the frb also announced that certain large bhcs including huntington will be permitted to make both dividend and share repurchases during the first quarter of subject to limits based on the amount of dividends paid in the second quarter of and the banks average net income for the four preceding quarters our first quarter dividend that was declared by the board of directors on january complies with these limits the frb will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if the restrictions on first

and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing

presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal

the risk management and capital discussion of this report as well as the regulatory matters section included in item business of this report huntington bancshares incorporated critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below allowance for credit losses our acl at december represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit management estimates the allowance for credit losses by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings one of the most significant judgments influencing the allowance for credit losses estimate is the macroeconomic forecasts key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates and gross domestic product changes in the economic forecasts could significantly affect the estimated credit losses which could potentially lead to materially different allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables within our modeling framework it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the allowance as a result management uses a probabilityweighted approach that incorporates a baseline an adverse and a more favorable economic scenario when formulating the quantitative estimate this quarter however to illustrate a hypothetical sensitivity analysis management calculated a quantitative allowance using a weighting applied to an adverse scenario this scenario includes assumptions around new infections and covid19 deaths being significantly above the baseline projections leading to a much slower reopening of the economy under this scenario as an example the unemployment rate remains elevated for a prolonged period and is estimated to remain at and at the end of and respectively these numbers represent approximately higher unemployment estimates than baseline scenario projections of and respectively for the same time periods to demonstrate the sensitivity to key economic parameters management calculated the difference between a baseline weighting and a adverse scenario weighting for modeled results this would result in an incremental quantitative allowance impact of approximately million the resulting difference is not intended to represent an expected increase in allowance levels for a number of reasons including the following management uses a weighted approach applied to multiple economic scenarios for its allowance estimation process the highly uncertain economic environment the difficulty in predicting the interrelationships between the economic parameters used in the various economic scenarios and the sensitivity estimate does not account for any general reserve components and associated risk profile adjustments incorporated by management as part of its overall allowance framework we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial form 10k obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as the current covid19 pandemic could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations the extent to which the current covid19 pandemic has and will continue to negatively impact our businesses financial condition liquidity and results will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and cannot be forecasted with precision at this time for more information see note loans leases and note allowance for c redit losses of the notes to consolidated financial statements fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis including securities and derivative instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment including among others discount rates rates of return on assets cash flows default rates loss rates terminal values and liquidation values a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility and could result in significant impact on our results of operations financial condition or disclosures of fair value information the fair value hierarchy requires use of observable inputs first and subsequently unobservable inputs when observable inputs are not available our fair value measurements involve various valuation techniques and models which involve inputs that are observable level or level in fair value hierarchy when available the level of judgment required to determine fair value is dependent on the methods or techniques used in the process assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value using quoted prices in active markets level do not require significant judgment while the valuation of assets and liabilities when quoted market prices are not available levels and may require significant judgment to assess whether observable or unobservable inputs for those assets and liabilities provide reasonable determination of fair value the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy additional discussion regarding fair value measurements and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs can be found in note fair value of assets and liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective acquisitions typically result in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life which is also subjective customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets including but not limited to customer deposit intangibles the emergence of covid19 as a global pandemic during has resulted in significant deterioration of the economic environment which has impacted expected earnings the heightened uncertainty in the economic environment has remained throughout as a result management performed an assessment of the goodwill balance at december a qualitative assessment was deemed to be sufficient and reasonable and the result of this assessment indicated it was probable that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to exceed the respective carrying values and therefore management determined that a full goodwill test was not warranted goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related assumptions and estimates used by management in the event of a prolonged economic downturn or further deterioration in the economic outlook continued assessments of our goodwill balance could be required in future periods any impairment charge would huntington bancshares incorporated not affect huntingtons regulatory capital ratios tangible common equity ratio or
