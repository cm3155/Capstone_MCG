item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this mda provides information we believe necessary for understanding our financial condition changes in financial condition results of operations and cash flows the mda should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements notes to consolidated financial statements and other information contained in this report the forwardlooking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve assumptions risks uncertainties and other factors including statements regarding our plans objectives goals strategies and financial performance our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forwardlooking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forwardlooking statements and those set forth in item executive overview financial performance review in we reported net income of billion a increase from the prior year earnings per common share on a diluted basis for the year were up from the prior year fullytaxable equivalent net interest income for increased million or from this reflected the impact of average earning asset growth and a growth of average interestbearing liabilities fte net interest margin decreased basis points to average earning asset growth reflects a billion or increase in average loans and leases the nim compression reflected a basis point increase in funding costs partially offset by a basis point positive impact from earning asset yields and a basis point increase in the benefit from noninterestbearing funding the provision for credit losses was million up million or the increase in provision expense over the prior year was primarily attributed to higher commercial losses noninterest income was billion up million or from the prior year mortgage banking income increased million or driven by increased volume and higher salable spreads card and payment processing income increased million or due to increased account activity capital markets fees increased million or driven by increased underwriting activity primarily associated with the hse acquisition other noninterest income increased million or as a result of the gain on the sale of the wisconsin retail branches and the impact of the new lease accounting standard with regard to the presentation of income for personal property tax on leased assets noninterest expense was billion up million or from the prior year personnel costs increased million or primarily reflecting the shift toward colleagues supporting our core strategies annual merit increases and million of expense related to position reductions completed in the fourth quarter outside data processing and other services increased million or primarily driven by higher technology investment costs partially offsetting these increases deposit and other insurance expense decreased million or primarily due to the discontinuation of the fdic surcharge in the fourth quarter net occupancy expense decreased million or primarily reflecting lower branch and facility consolidationrelated expense as the fourth quarter included million of consolidationrelated expense marketing decreased million or primarily reflecting pacing of marketing campaigns and deposit promotions the tangible common equity to tangible assets ratio was up basis points the regulatory common equity tier cet1 riskbased capital ratio was up basis points the regulatory tier riskbased capital ratio was up basis points consistent with the capital plan the company repurchased million of common stock during at an average cost of per share and discharge situations over the past five years the accruing component of the total tdr balance has been consistently over indicating there is no identified credit loss and the borrowers continue to make their monthly payments as of december over of the million of accruing tdrs secured by residential real estate residential mortgage and home equity in table are current on their required payments with over of the accruing pool having had no delinquency in the past months there is limited migration from the accruing to nonaccruing components and virtually all of the chargeoffs within this group of loans come from the nonaccruing tdr balances s will result in a chargeoff to estimated collateral value less anticipated selling costs at the time of discharge commercial loans are either chargedoff or written down to net realizable value by 90days past due with the exception of administrative small ticket lease delinquencies automobile loans rv and marine and other consumer loans are generally fully chargedoff at 120days past due firstlien and juniorlien home equity loans are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the collateral less anticipated selling costs at 150days past due and 120days past due respectively residential mortgages are chargedoff to the estimated fair value of the

estate total commercial consumer automobile home equity residential mortgage rv and marine other consumer total consumer net chargeoffs as a of average loans table end in assessing nco trends it is helpful to understand the process of how commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll is established consistent with the level of risk associated with the commercial portfolios original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans loans within the portfolio are periodically reviewed and the alll is increased or decreased based on the updated risk ratings for tdrs and individually assessed impaired loans a specific reserve is established based on the discounted projected cash flows or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll is established consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan although specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans except for tdrs in summary if loan quality deteriorates the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases in nals when a loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in the alll or an expectation of higher future ncos huntington bancshares incorporated versus ncos increased million or in the increase from the yearago period was primarily centered in the commercial portfolio market risk market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans interest rate risk we actively manage interest rate risk as changes in market interest rates may have a significant impact on reported earnings changes in market interest rates may result in changes in the fair market value of our financial instruments cash flows and net interest income we seek to achieve consistent growth in net interest income and capital while managing volatility arising from shifts in market interest rates the alco oversees interest rate and mortgage price risk as well as the establishment of risk measures limits and policy guidelines for managing the amount of interest rate and mortgage price risk and its effect on net interest income and capital responsibility for measuring and the management of interest rate risk resides with corporate treasury interest rate risk on our balance sheet consists of reprice option and basis risks reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options present in the investment portfolio and in many financial instruments such as loan prepayment options deposit early withdrawal options and interest rate options these options allow customers opportunities to benefit when market interest rates change which typically results in higher costs or lower revenue for us basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in a narrowing of profit spread on an earning asset or liability basis risk is also present in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where historical pricing relationships to market rates may change due to the level or directional change in market interest rates the interest rate risk position is measured and monitored using risk management tools including earnings simulation modeling and eve sensitivity analysis which capture both shortterm and longterm interest rate risk exposures combining the results from these separate risk measurement processes allows a reasonably comprehensive view of our shortterm and longterm interest rate risks interest rate risk measurement is calculated and reported to the alco monthly and roc at least quarterly the reported information includes periodend results and identifies any policy limits exceeded along with an assessment of the policy limit breach and the action plan and timeline for resolution mitigation or assumption of the risk we use two approaches to model interest rate risk net interest income at risk nii at risk and economic value of equity at risk modeling sensitivity analysis eve nii at risk uses net interest income simulation analysis which involves forecasting net interest earnings under a variety of scenarios including changes in the level of interest rates the shape of the yield curve and spreads between market interest rates the sensitivity of net interest income to changes in interest rates is measured using numerous interest rate scenarios including shocks gradual ramps curve flattening curve steepening as well as forecasts of likely interest rates scenarios modeling the sensitivity of net interest earnings to changes in market interest rates is highly dependent on numerous assumptions incorporated into the modeling process to the extent that actual performance is different than what was assumed actual net interest earnings sensitivity may be different than projected the assumptions used in the models are our best estimates based on studies conducted by the treasury group the treasury group uses a data warehouse to study interest rate risk at a transactional level and uses various adhoc reports to continuously refine assumptions assumptions and methodologies regarding administered rate liabilities eg savings accounts money market accounts and interestbearing checking accounts balance trends and repricing relationships reflect our best estimate of expected behavior and these assumptions are reviewed regularly form 10k we also have longerterm interest rate risk exposure which may not be appropriately measured by earnings sensitivity analysis the alco uses eve to study the impact of longterm cash flows on earnings and on capital eve involves discounting present values of all cash flows of on and offbalance sheet items under different interest rate scenarios the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our eve the analysis requires modifying the expected cash flows in each interest rate scenario which will impact the discounted present value the amount of basecase measurement and its sensitivity to shifts in the yield curve allow us to measure longerterm repricing and option risk in the balance sheet table start table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december december table end table start the policy limit for the basis point scenario changed from which was in effect at december to as of september table end the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months the decrease in sensitivity was driven by the purchase of interest rate floors as well as additional interest rate swaps changes to the actual and forecasted portfolio composition and movements in market rates our nii at risk is within our board of directors policy limits for the and basis point scenarios the nii at risk shows that our balance sheet is asset sensitive at both december and december table start table economic value of equity at risk economic value of equity at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits december december table end the eve results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models immediate and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates we are within our risk appetite policy limits established by the risk oversight committee roc for the and basis point scenarios the eve depicts an asset sensitive balance sheet profile in the basis point scenario and a liability sensitive profile due to additional convexity in the and basis point scenarios the decline in asset sensitivity was driven by slower security prepayments deposit runoff assumption changes and the addition of interest rate swaps and floors mentioned above msrs this section should be read in conjunction with note mortgage loan sales and servicing rights of notes to consolidated financial statements at december we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans of this million million was recorded using the amortization method and million was recorded using the fair value method as of january huntington made an irrevocable election to subsequently measure all classes of residential msrs at fair value in order to eliminate any potential measurement mismatch between our economic hedges and the msrs the impact of the irrevocable election was not material msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes or impairment however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report changes in the msr value net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage banking income category of noninterest income huntington bancshares incorporated decreases in fair value of the msr below amortized costs would be recognized as a decrease in mortgage banking income any increase in the fair value to the extent of prior impairment would be recognized as an increase in mortgage banking income msr assets are included in servicing rights and other intangible assets in the consolidated financial statements price risk price risk represents the risk of loss arising from adverse movements in the prices of financial instruments that are carried at fair value and are subject to fair value accounting we have price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions derivative instruments and equity investments we have established loss limits on the trading portfolio on the amount of foreign exchange exposure that can be maintained and on the amount of marketable equity securities that can be held liquidity risk liquidity risk is the possibility of us being unable to meet current and future financial obligations in a timely manner liquidity is managed to ensure stable reliable and costeffective sources of funds to satisfy demand for credit deposit withdrawals and investment opportunities we consider core earnings strong capital ratios and credit quality essential for maintaining high credit ratings which allows us costeffective access to marketbased liquidity we rely on a large stable core deposit base and a diversified base of wholesale funding sources to manage liquidity risk the alco is appointed by the roc to oversee liquidity risk management and the establishment of liquidity risk policies and limits liquidity risk is managed centrally by corporate treasury the position is evaluated daily weekly and monthly by analyzing the composition of all funding sources reviewing projected liquidity commitments by future months and identifying sources and uses of funds the overall management of our liquidity position is also integrated into retail and commercial pricing policies to ensure a stable core deposit base liquidity risk is reviewed and managed continuously for the bank and the parent company as well as its subsidiaries in addition liquidity working groups meet regularly to identify and monitor liquidity positions provide policy guidance review funding strategies and oversee the adherence to and maintenance of the contingency funding plans our primary source of liquidity is our core deposit base core deposits comprised approximately of total deposits at december we also have available unused wholesale sources of liquidity including advances from the fhlb issuance through dealers in the capital markets and access to certificates of deposit issued through brokers liquidity is further provided by unencumbered or unpledged investment securities that totaled billion as of december the treasury department also prepares a contingency funding plan that details the potential erosion of funds in the event of a systemic financial market crisis or institutionalspecific stress scenario an example of an institution specific event would be a downgrade in our public credit rating by a rating agency due to factors such as deterioration in asset quality a large charge to earnings a decline in profitability or other financial measures or a significant merger or acquisition examples of systemic events unrelated to us that could have an effect on our access to liquidity would be terrorism or war natural disasters political events or the default or bankruptcy of a major corporation mutual fund or hedge fund similarly market speculation or rumors about us or the banking industry in general may adversely affect the cost and availability of normal funding sources the liquidity contingency plan therefore outlines the process for addressing a liquidity crisis the plan provides for an evaluation of funding sources under various market conditions it also assigns specific roles and responsibilities and communication protocols for effectively managing liquidity through a problem period investment securities portfolio this section should be read in conjunction with note investment securities and other securities of

standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans commitments to extend credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these

methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology form 10k committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality to mitigate operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and the audit committee as appropriate significant findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the technology committee of the board as appropriate the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending andor other courses related to the extension of credit we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance

of preferred stock and trust preferred securities any capital actions including those contemplated above are subject to approval by huntingtons board of directors on july the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of common shares over the four quarters through the second quarter purchases of common stock under the authorization may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and accelerated repurchase programs during the fourth quarter huntington repurchased a total of million shares at a weighted average share price of huntington bancshares incorporated dividends we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective with dividends representing one component our strong capital ratios and expectations for continued earnings growth positions us to continue to actively explore additional capital management opportunities share repurchases from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the

our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how we monitor results and assess performance we have four major business segments consumer and business banking commercial banking vehicle finance and regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg the treasury other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions for a discussion of business segment trends for versus see part ii item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business segment discussion included in our form 10k filed with

business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported significant items if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments form 10k funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities during the company updated and refined its ftp methodology primarily related to the allocation of deposit funding costs prior period amounts presented below have been restated to reflect

financial measures and nongaap financial measures where management believes it to be helpful in understanding our results of operations or financial position where nongaap financial measures are used the comparable gaap financial measure as well as the reconciliation to the comparable gaap financial measure can be found herein significant items from timetotime revenue expenses or taxes are impacted by items judged by us to be outside of our ordinary business activities andor by items that while they may be associated with ordinary banking activities are so unusually large that their outsized impact is believed by us at that time to be infrequent or shortterm in nature we refer to such items as significant items most often these significant items result from factors originating outside the company eg regulatory actions assessments windfall gains onetime tax assessments refunds litigation actions etc in other cases they may result from our decisions associated with significant corporate actions outside of the ordinary course of business eg merger restructuring charges recapitalization actions goodwill impairment etc even though certain revenue and expense items are naturally subject to more volatility than others due to changes in market and economic environment conditions as a general rule volatility alone does not define a significant item for example changes in the provision for credit losses gains losses from investment activities asset valuation writedowns etc reflect ordinary banking activities and are therefore typically excluded from consideration as a significant item we believe the disclosure of significant items provides a better understanding of our performance and trends to ascertain which of such items if any to include or exclude from an analysis of our performance ie within the context of determining how that performance differed from expectations as well as how if at all to adjust estimates of future performance accordingly to this end we adopted a practice of listing significant items in our external disclosure documents eg earnings press releases investor presentations forms 10q and 10k significant items

using basel iii definitions table end these nonregulatory capital ratios are viewed by management as useful additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the company are considered nongaap financial measures form 10k because there are no

critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note significant accounting policies of the notes to consolidated financial statements which is incorporated by reference into this mda describes the significant accounting policies we used in our consolidated financial statements an accounting estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting policies and estimates and their related application are discussed below allowance for credit losses our acl of million at december represents our estimate of probable credit losses inherent in our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risk associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in interest rates and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in the portfolio because of unanticipated adverse changes in the economy market conditions or events adversely affecting specific customers industries or markets if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially or if the acl is not appropriate our net income and capital could be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations for more information see note loans and leases and allowance for credit losses of the notes to consolidated financial statements fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and include trading securities availableforsale securities other securities loans held for sale loans held for investment msrs and derivative instruments at december approximately billion of our assets and billion of our liabilities were recorded at fair value on a recurring basis assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility significant adjustments and assumptions used in determining fair value include but are not limited to market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions that are used as significant inputs the type and level of judgment required is largely dependent on the amount of observable market information available where available we use quoted market prices to determine fair value if quoted market prices are not available fair value is determined based on inputs huntington bancshares incorporated that are either directly observable or derived from market data using either internally developed or independent thirdparty valuation models these inputs include but are not limited to interest rate yield curves credit spreads option volatilities and optionadjusted spreads where neither quoted market prices nor observable market data are available fair value is determined using valuation models that feature one or more significant unobservable inputs based on managements expectation of what market participants would use in determining the fair value of the asset or liability inputs to valuation models are considered unobservable if they are supported by little or no market activity in periods of extreme volatility lessened liquidity or in illiquid markets there may be more variability in market pricing or a lack of market data to use in the valuation process a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputs and are classified within levels and instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy for more information see note fair value of assets and liabilities of the notes to consolidated financial statements income taxes the calculation of our provision for income taxes requires the use of estimates and judgments we have two accruals for income taxes our income tax payable represents the estimated net amount currently due to the federal state and local taxing jurisdictions net of any reserve for potential audit issues and any tax refunds and our deferred federal and state income tax and related valuation accounts represents the estimated impact of temporary differences between how we recognize our assets and liabilities under gaap and how such assets and liabilities are recognized under federal and state tax law the net receivable balance and deferred tax accounts are presented as components of other assets or other liabilities in accordance with the asset or liability balance of the account in the ordinary course of business we operate in various taxing jurisdictions and are subject to income and nonincome taxes the effective tax rate is based in part on our interpretation of the relevant current tax laws we believe the aggregate liabilities related to taxes are appropriately reflected in the consolidated financial statements we review the appropriate tax treatment of all transactions taking into consideration statutory judicial and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax positions in addition we rely on various tax opinions recent tax audits and historical experience for more information see note income taxes of the notes to consolidated financial statements goodwill and intangible assets the acquisition method of accounting requires that acquired assets and liabilities are recorded at their fair values as of the date of acquisition this often involves estimates based on third party valuations or internal valuations based on discounted cash flow analyses or other valuation techniques all of which are inherently subjective acquisitions typically result in goodwill the amount by which the cost of net assets acquired in a business combination exceeds their fair value which is subject to impairment testing at least annually the amortization of identified intangible assets recognized in a business combination is based upon the estimated economic benefits to be received over their economic life which is also subjective customer attrition rates that are based on historical experience are used to determine the estimated economic life of certain intangibles assets including but not limited to customer deposit intangibles for more information see note goodwill and other intangible assets of the notes to consolidated financial statements recent accounting pronouncements and developments note accounting
