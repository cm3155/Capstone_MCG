commercial loans are treated as they deteriorate over time the alll is established consistent with the level of risk associated with the commercial portfolios original underwriting as a part of our normal portfolio management process for commercial loans loans within the portfolio are periodically reviewed and with improvement or deterioration in the risk rating there is a corresponding movement in allowance levels assuming an unchanged economic outlook for tdrs and loans with unique risk characteristics a specific reserve is established based on the discounted projected cash flows or collateral value of the specific loan chargeoffs if necessary are generally recognized in a period after the specific alll is established consumer loans are treated in much the same manner as commercial loans with increasing reserve factors applied based on the risk characteristics of the loan coupled with the economic conditions forecasted over the life of the loan specific reserves are not identified for consumer loans except for tdrs in summary if loan quality deteriorates or the likelihood of worsening economic conditions increases the typical credit sequence would be periods of reserve building followed by periods of higher ncos as the previously established alll is utilized additionally an increase in the alll either precedes or is in conjunction with increases huntington bancshares incorporated in nals when a commercial loan is classified as nal it is evaluated for specific alll or chargeoff as a result an increase in nals does not necessarily result in an increase in

management processes market risk refers to potential losses arising from changes in interest rates foreign exchange rates equity prices and commodity prices including the correlation among these factors and their volatility when the value of an instrument is tied to such external factors the holder faces market risk we are primarily exposed to interest rate risk as a result of offering a wide array of financial products to our customers and secondarily to price risk from trading securities securities owned by our brokerdealer subsidiaries foreign exchange positions equity investments and investments in securities backed by mortgage loans huntington measures market risk exposure via financial simulation models which provide management with insights on the potential impact to net interest income and other key metrics as a result of changes in market interest rates models are used to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of the balance sheet based on assumptions regarding the slope or shape of the yield curve the direction and volatility of interest rates and the changing composition and characteristics of the balance sheet resulting from strategic objectives and customer behavior assumptions and models provide insight on forecasted balance sheet growth and composition and the pricing and maturity characteristics of current and future business in measuring the financial risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in huntingtons balance sheet huntington compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates the market forward reflects the market consensus regarding the future level and slope of the yield curve across a range of tenor points the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes two types shock scenarios which are instantaneous parallel rate shifts and ramp scenarios where the parallel shift is applied gradually over the first months of the forecast on a pro rata basis measures of net interest income at risk follow ramp scenarios and measures of economic value of equity follows shock scenarios in both shock and ramp scenarios with falling rates huntington presumes that market rates cannot go below the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate risk hedging activities forward starting hedges are included to the extent that they have been transacted and that they start within the measurement horizon table net interest income at risk net interest income at risk basis point change scenario board policy limits na june december the nii at risk results included in the table above reflect the analysis used monthly by management it models gradual and basis point parallel shifts in market interest rates implied by the forward yield curve over the next twelve months with rates having fallen materially in the first half of the down basis point scenario would result in market rates reaching floored values which can produce a distorted view of interest rate risk metrics management is now using the down basis point scenario which is more meaningful in the current market rate environment than the down basis point scenario management does consider additional scenarios with forecasted negative market rates which would result in margin deterioration the increase in sensitivity was driven by the impact of lower forecast rates on nonmaturity deposits resulting in slower balance runoff and higher securities prepayments in the implied forward scenario providing more opportunity for higher reinvestment rates in up rate environments huntington bancshares incorporated our nii at risk is within our board of directors policy limits for the and basis point scenarios there is no board policy limit for the down basis point

board policy limit for the down basis point scenario the eve depicts an asset sensitive balance sheet profile the change in sensitivity was driven primarily by lower interest rates slowing deposit runoff and to a lesser extent expected securities portfolio runoff use of derivatives to manage interest rate risk an integral component of our interest rate risk management strategy is use of derivative instruments to minimize significant fluctuations in earnings caused by changes in market interest rates examples of derivative instruments that we may use as part of our interest rate risk management strategy include interest rate swaps interest rate floors forward contracts and forward starting interest rate swaps table shows all swap and floor positions that are utilized for purposes of managing our exposures to the variability of interest rates these positions are used to convert the contractual interest rate index of agreedupon amounts of assets and liabilities ie notional amounts to another interest rate index or to hedge forecasted transactions for the variability in cash flows attributable to the contractually specified interest rate the volume maturity and mix of portfolio swaps change frequently as we adjust our broader interest rate risk management objectives and the balance sheet positions to be hedged for further information including the notional amount

economic hedges and the msrs the impact of the irrevocable election was not material at june we had a total of million of capitalized msrs representing the right to service billion in mortgage loans msr fair values are sensitive to movements in interest rates as expected future net servicing income depends on the projected outstanding principal balances of the underlying loans which can be reduced by prepayments prepayments usually increase when mortgage interest rates decline and decrease when mortgage interest rates rise we also employ hedging strategies to reduce the risk of msr fair value changes however volatile changes in interest rates can diminish the effectiveness of these economic hedges we report changes in the msr value net of hedgerelated trading activity in the mortgage

swaps and floors financial guarantees contained in standby lettersofcredit issued by the bank and commitments by the bank to sell mortgage loans operational risk operational risk is the risk of loss due to human error inadequate or failed internal systems and controls including the use of financial or other quantitative methodologies that may not adequately predict future results violations of or noncompliance with laws rules regulations prescribed practices or ethical standards and external influences such as market conditions fraudulent activities disasters failed business contingency plans and security risks we continuously strive to strengthen our system of internal controls to ensure compliance with laws rules and regulations and to improve the oversight of our operational risk we actively monitor cyberattacks such as attempts related to online deception and loss of sensitive customer data we evaluate internal systems processes and controls to mitigate loss from cyberattacks and to date have not experienced any material losses cybersecurity threats have increased primarily through covid19 themed phishing campaigns we are actively monitoring our email gateways for malicious phishing email campaigns we have also increased our cybersecurity monitoring activities through the implementation of specific monitoring of remote connections by geography and volume of connections to detect anomalous remote logins since a significant portion of our workforce is now working remotely our objective for managing cyber security risk is to avoid or minimize the impacts of external threat events or other efforts to penetrate our systems we work to achieve this objective by hardening networks and systems against attack and by diligently managing visibility and monitoring controls within our data and communications environment to recognize events and respond before the attacker has the opportunity to plan and execute on its own goals to this end we employ a set of defense indepth strategies which include efforts to make us less attractive as a target and less vulnerable to threats while investing in threat analytic capabilities for rapid detection and response potential concerns related to cyber security may be escalated to our boardlevel technology committee as appropriate as a complement to the overall cyber security risk management we use a number of internal training methods both formally through mandatory courses and informally through written communications and other updates internal policies and procedures have been implemented to encourage the reporting of potential phishing attacks or other security risks we also use thirdparty services to test the effectiveness of our cyber security risk management framework and any such third parties are required to comply with our policies regarding information security and confidentiality to mitigate operational risks we have an operational risk committee a legal regulatory and compliance committee a funds movement committee and a third party risk management committee the responsibilities of these committees among other duties include establishing and maintaining management information systems to monitor material risks and to identify potential concerns risks or trends that may have a significant impact and ensuring that recommendations are developed to address the identified issues in addition we have a model risk oversight committee that is responsible for policies and procedures describing how model risk is evaluated and managed and the application of the governance process to implement these practices throughout the enterprise these committees report any significant findings and recommendations to the risk management committee potential concerns may be escalated to our roc and the audit committee as appropriate significant findings or issues are escalated by the third party risk management committee to the technology committee of the board as appropriate form 10q the goal of this framework is to implement effective operational risk techniques and strategies minimize operational fraud and legal losses minimize the impact of inadequately designed models and enhance our overall performance compliance risk financial institutions are subject to many laws rules and regulations at both the federal and state levels these broadbased laws rules and regulations include but are not limited to expectations relating to antimoney laundering lending limits client privacy fair lending prohibitions against unfair deceptive or abusive acts or practices protections for military members as they enter active duty and community reinvestment the volume and complexity of recent regulatory changes have increased our overall compliance risk as such we utilize various resources to help ensure expectations are met including a team of compliance experts dedicated to ensuring our conformance with all applicable laws rules and regulations our colleagues receive training for several broadbased laws and regulations including but not limited to antimoney laundering and customer privacy additionally colleagues engaged in lending activities receive training for laws and regulations related to flood disaster protection equal credit opportunity fair lending andor other courses related to the extension of credit we set a high standard of expectation for adherence to compliance management and seek to continuously enhance our performance capital both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are managed at the bank and on a consolidated basis we have an active program for managing capital and maintain a comprehensive process for assessing the companys overall capital adequacy we believe our current levels of both regulatory capital and shareholders equity are adequate as disclosed in our form 10k the us federal banking regulatory agencies permitted bhcs and banks to phasein for regulatory capital purposes the dayone impact of the new cecl accounting rule on retained earnings over a period of three years as part of its response to the impact of covid19 on march the us federal banking regulatory agencies issued an interim final

wellcapitalized standards established by the frb the balance sheet growth was driven predominately by ppp loans and elevated deposits at the federal reserve both of which are risk weighted and as such did not have a material impact on the regulatory capital ratios the capital impact of the repurchase of million of common stock over the last four quarters none in the second quarter and cash dividends effectively offset earnings adjusted for the cecl transition on a yearoveryear basis the regulatory tier riskbased capital and total riskbased capital ratios also reflect the issuance of million of series f preferred stock in the second quarter shareholders equity we generate shareholders equity primarily through the retention of earnings net of dividends and share repurchases other potential sources of shareholders equity include issuances of common and preferred stock our objective is to maintain capital at an amount commensurate with our risk profile and risk tolerance objectives to meet both regulatory and market expectations and to provide the flexibility needed for future growth and business opportunities shareholders equity totaled billion at june an increase of million or when compared with december due to the issuance of million of series f preferred stock during second quarter on june we were notified by the frb that under the severely adverse economic stress scenario in the supervisory stress tests our modeled capital ratios would continue to exceed the minimum requirements under the frbs capital adequacy rules in addition the frb notified us that our preliminary stress capital buffer is which is the minimum under the stress capital buffer framework our initial stress capital buffer will be in effect from october until september unless the frb provides us with a revised stress capital buffer in connection with our resubmitted capital plan as discussed further below the frb may but is not required to recalculate a large bhcs stress capital buffer after receiving an updated capital plan form 10q the frb also announced on june that certain large bhcs including huntington will not be permitted to make share repurchases subject to certain limited exceptions during the third quarter of but will be permitted to make dividend payments in the third quarter subject to limits based on the amount of dividends paid in the second quarter and the banks average net income for the four preceding quarters our third quarter dividend that was declared by the board of directors on july complies with these limits in addition large bhcs including huntington will be required to resubmit and update their capital plans later this year to reflect ongoing stresses caused by the covid19 pandemic the frb will conduct additional analysis each quarter to determine if the restrictions on third quarter capital distributions should be extended to future quarters dividends we consider disciplined capital management as a key objective with dividends representing one component our strong capital ratios position us to take advantage of additional capital management opportunities share repurchases from time to time the board of directors authorizes the company to repurchase shares of our common stock although we announce when the board of directors authorizes share repurchases we typically do not give any public notice before we repurchase our shares future stock repurchases may be private or openmarket repurchases including block transactions accelerated or delayed block transactions forward transactions and similar transactions various factors determine the amount and timing of our share repurchases including our capital requirements the number of shares we expect to issue for employee benefit plans and acquisitions market conditions including the trading price of our stock and regulatory and legal considerations we do not currently expect to repurchase common shares during the third quarter however the board has authorized the repurchase of common shares during the third quarter to offset compensation planrelated share issuances as permitted by the federal reserve board we may at our discretion repurchase common shares as permitted by this board authorization purchases of common shares under the authorization may include open market purchases privately negotiated transactions and accelerated share repurchase programs business segment discussion overview our business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how we monitor results and assess performance we have four major business segments consumer and business banking commercial banking vehicle finance and regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg the treasury other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense business segment results are determined based upon our management practices which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around our organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions revenue sharing revenue is recorded in the business segment responsible for the related product or service fee sharing is recorded to allocate portions of such revenue to other business segments involved in selling to or providing service to customers results of operations for the business segments reflect these fee sharing allocations expense allocation the management process that develops the business segment reporting utilizes various estimates and allocation methodologies to measure the performance of the business segments expenses are allocated to business segments using a twophase approach the first phase consists of measuring and assigning unit costs activitybased costs to activities related to product origination and servicing these activitybased costs are then extended based on volumes with the resulting amount allocated to business segments that own the related products the second phase consists of the allocation of overhead costs to all four business segments from huntington bancshares incorporated treasury other we utilize a fullallocation methodology where all treasury other expenses except reported significant items if any and a small amount of other residual unallocated expenses are allocated to the four business segments funds transfer pricing ftp we use an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities net income by business segment net income by business segment for the sixmonth periods ending june and june is

additional methods of reflecting the level of capital available to withstand unexpected market conditions additionally presentation of these ratios allows readers to compare our capitalization to other financial services companies these ratios differ from capital ratios defined by banking regulators principally in that the numerator excludes goodwill and other intangible assets the nature and extent of which varies among different financial services companies these ratios are not defined in gaap or federal banking regulations as a result these nonregulatory capital ratios disclosed by the

report critical accounting policies and use of significant estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to establish accounting policies and make estimates that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements note of the notes to consolidated financial statements

estimate requires assumptions and judgments about uncertain matters that could have a material effect on the consolidated financial statements estimates are made under facts and circumstances at a point in time and changes in those facts and circumstances could produce results substantially different from those estimates our most significant accounting estimates relate to our acl valuation of financial instruments contingent liabilities income taxes and deferred tax assetsliabilities these significant accounting estimates and their related application are discussed in our december form 10k allowance for credit losses our acl at june represents our current estimate of the lifetime credit losses expected from our loan and lease portfolio and our unfunded loan commitments and letters of credit management estimates the allowance for credit losses by projecting probability of default loss given default and exposure at default conditional on economic parameters for the remaining contractual term internal factors that impact the quarterly allowance estimate include the level of outstanding balances the portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings key external economic parameters that directly impact our loss modeling framework include forecasted footprint unemployment rates interest rates consumer confidence index fhfa house pricing index and gross domestic product we regularly review our acl for appropriateness by performing ongoing evaluations of the loan and lease portfolio in doing so we consider factors such as the differing economic risks associated with each loan category the financial condition of specific borrowers the level of delinquent loans the value of any collateral and where applicable the existence of any guarantees or other documented support we also evaluate the impact of changes in key economic parameters and overall economic conditions on the ability of borrowers to meet their financial obligations when quantifying our exposure to credit losses and assessing the appropriateness of our acl at each reporting date there is no certainty that our acl will be appropriate over time to cover losses in our portfolio as economic and market conditions may ultimately differ from our reasonable and supportable forecast additionally events adversely affecting specific customers industries or our markets such as the current covid19 pandemic could severely impact our current expectations if the credit quality of our customer base materially deteriorates or the risk profile of a market industry or group of customers changes materially our net income and capital could huntington bancshares incorporated be materially adversely affected which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and

financial statements fair value measurement certain assets and liabilities are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and include trading securities availableforsale securities other securities loans held for sale loans held for investment msrs and derivative instruments assets and liabilities carried at fair value inherently include subjectivity and may require the use of significant assumptions adjustments and judgment a significant change in assumptions may result in a significant change in fair value which in turn may result in a higher degree of financial statement volatility significant adjustments and assumptions used in determining fair value include but are not limited to market liquidity and credit quality where appropriate valuations of products using models or other techniques are sensitive to assumptions used for the significant inputs a significant portion of our assets and liabilities that are reported at fair value are measured based on quoted market prices or observable market independent inputs and are classified within levels and instruments valued using internally developed valuation models and other valuation techniques that use significant unobservable inputs are classified within level of the valuation hierarchy at the end of each quarter we assess the valuation hierarchy for each asset or liability measured as necessary assets or liabilities may be transferred within hierarchy levels due to changes in availability of observable market inputs at the measurement date the fair values measured at each level of the fair value hierarchy additional discussion regarding fair value measurements and a brief description of how fair value is determined for categories that have unobservable inputs can be found in note fair values of assets and liabilities of the notes to unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements goodwill the emergence of covid19 as a global pandemic during the first quarter has resulted in significant deterioration of the economic environment which has impacted expected earnings the heightened uncertainty in the economic environment has continued into the second quarter as a result management performed a qualitative assessment of the goodwill balance at june the result of this assessment indicated it was probable that the fair value of each of our reporting units continues to exceed the respective carrying values and therefore management determined that a full goodwill test was not warranted goodwill assessments are highly sensitive to economic projections and the related

of determining an appropriate acl level for these loans huntington utilizes the following internally defined categories of credit grades pass higher quality loans that do not fit any of the other categories described below olem the credit risk may be relatively minor yet represents a risk given certain specific circumstances if the potential weaknesses are not monitored or mitigated the loan may weaken or the collateral may be inadequate to protect huntingtons position in the future for these reasons huntington considers the loans to be potential problem loans substandard inadequately protected loans resulting from the borrowers ability to repay equity andor the collateral pledged to secure the loan these loans have identified weaknesses that could hinder normal repayment or collection of the debt it is likely huntington will sustain some loss if any identified weaknesses are not mitigated doubtful loans that have all of the weaknesses inherent in those loans classified as substandard with the added elements of the full collection of the loan is improbable and that the possibility of loss is high loans are generally assigned a category of pass rating upon initial approval and subsequently updated as appropriate based on the borrowers financial performance commercial loans categorized as olem substandard or doubtful are considered criticized loans commercial loans categorized as substandard or doubtful are both considered classified loans for all classes within the consumer loan portfolio loans are assigned pool level pd factors based on the fico range within which the borrowers credit bureau score falls a credit bureau score is a credit score developed by fico based on data provided by the credit bureaus the credit bureau score is widely accepted as the standard measure of consumer credit risk used by lenders regulators rating agencies and consumers the higher the credit bureau score the higher likelihood of repayment and therefore an

topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments which replaced the incurred loss methodology with an expected loss methodology that is referred to as the current expected credit loss cecl methodology the measurement of expected credit losses under cecl is applicable to financial assets measured at amortized cost including loan receivables and heldtomaturity debt securities it also applies to offbalance sheet exposures not accounted for as insurance and net investments in leases accounted for under asc topic additionally asc topic made changes to the accounting for afs debt securities including a requirement to present credit losses as an allowance rather than as a writedown on afs debt securities that management does not intend to sell or believes will not be required to sell huntington adopted asc topic using the modified retrospective method for all financial assets in scope of the standard results for reporting periods beginning after january are presented under asc topic while prior period amounts continue to be reported in accordance with previously applicable gaap upon adoption huntington recorded an increase to the acl of million and a corresponding decrease to retained earnings of approximately million net of tax of million the overall increase to the acl at adoption is comprised of a million increase in the commercial alll a million increase in the consumer alll and a million increase to the aulc the allowance for credit losses is deducted from the amortized cost basis of a financial asset or a group of financial assets so that the balance sheet reflects the net amount huntington expects to collect amortized cost is the principal balance outstanding net of purchase premiums and discounts fair value hedge accounting adjustments and deferred fees and costs subsequent changes favorable and unfavorable in expected credit losses are recognized immediately in net income as a credit loss expense or a reversal of credit loss expense management estimates the allowance by projecting probabilityofdefault lossgivendefault and exposureatdefault depending on economic parameters for each month of the remaining contractual term those economic parameters are developed using available information relating to past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts huntingtons reasonable and supportable forecast period reverts to a historical norm based on inputs within approximately two to three years the reversion period is dependent on the state of the economy at the beginning of the forecast historical credit experience provides the basis for the estimation of expected credit losses with adjustments made for differences in current loanspecific risk characteristics such as differences in underwriting standards portfolio mix delinquency levels and terms as well as for changes in the micro and macroeconomic environments the contractual terms of financial assets are adjusted for expected prepayments and any extensions outside of huntingtons control loans that are determined to have unique risk characteristics are evaluated on an individual basis by management if a loan is determined to be collateral dependent or meets the criteria to apply the collateral dependent practical expedient expected credit losses are determined based on the fair value of the collateral at the reporting date less costs to sell as appropriate loans with unique risk characteristics that are not subject to collateral dependent accounting are assessed using a discounted cash flows methodology the allowance for credit losses is measured on a collective pool basis when similar risk characteristics exist management believes the products within each of the entitys portfolio classes exhibit similar risk characteristics huntington has identified its portfolio classes as disclosed above allowance for credit losses htm securities nearly all of huntingtons htm debt securities are issued by us government entities and agencies these securities are either explicitly or implicitly guaranteed by the us government are highly rated by major rating agencies and have a long history of no credit losses as such there is currently zero loss expectation for this portfolio huntington bancshares incorporated allowance for credit losses afs securities for individual debt securities classified as afs huntington assesses whether a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis has resulted from a credit loss or other factors any impairment relating to credit losses would be recognized through an allowance for credit losses at june it was determined that no allowance was required any impairment due to factors other than a credit loss such as changes in market interest rates is recognized in other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes impairment is determined on an individual security basis therefore an afs debt security cannot be combined with other securities to determine whether

reflected in the unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements the contract amounts of these financial agreements at june and december were as follows dollar amounts in millions june december contract amount representing credit risk commitments to extend credit commercial consumer commercial real estate standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit commitments to extend credit generally have fixed expiration dates are variablerate and contain clauses that permit huntington to terminate or otherwise renegotiate the contracts in the event of a significant deterioration in the customers credit quality these arrangements normally require the payment of a fee by the customer the pricing of which is based on prevailing market conditions credit quality probability of funding and other relevant factors since many of these commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon the contract amounts are not necessarily indicative of future cash requirements the interest rate risk arising from these financial instruments is insignificant as a result of their predominantly shortterm variablerate nature form 10q standby lettersofcredit are conditional commitments issued to guarantee the performance of a customer to a thirdparty these guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements including commercial paper bond financing and similar transactions most of these arrangements mature within two years the carrying amount of deferred revenue associated with these guarantees was million and million at june and december

statements of the corporations annual report on form 10k and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements of the corporations quarterly report on form 10q for the quarter ended march collectively the prior commitments and contingencies disclosures in the ordinary course of business huntington is routinely a defendant in or party to pending and threatened legal and regulatory actions and proceedings in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of such matters particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories or involve a large number of parties huntington generally cannot predict what the eventual outcome of the pending matters will be what the timing of the ultimate resolution of these matters will be or what the eventual loss fines or penalties related to each matter may be huntington establishes an accrued liability when those matters present loss contingencies that are both probable and estimable in such cases there may be an exposure to loss in excess of any amounts accrued huntington thereafter continues to monitor the matter for further developments that could affect the amount of the accrued liability that has been previously established for certain matters huntington is able to estimate a range of possible loss in cases in which huntington possesses information to estimate a range of possible loss that estimate is aggregated and disclosed below there may be other matters for which a loss is probable or reasonably possible but such an estimate of the range of possible loss may not be possible for those matters where an estimate of the range of possible loss is possible management currently estimates the aggregate range of possible loss is to million at june in excess of the accrued liability if any related to those matters this estimated range of possible loss is based upon currently available information and is subject to significant judgment a variety of assumptions and known and unknown uncertainties the matters underlying the estimated range will change from time to time and actual results may vary significantly from the current estimate the estimated range of possible loss does not represent huntingtons maximum loss exposure based on current knowledge management does not believe that loss contingencies arising from pending matters will have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of huntington further management believes that amounts accrued are adequate to address huntingtons contingent liabilities however in light of the inherent uncertainties involved in these matters some of which are beyond huntingtons control and the large or indeterminate damages sought in some of these matters an adverse outcome in one or more of these matters could be material to huntingtons results of operations for any particular reporting period segment reporting huntingtons business segments are based on our internallyaligned segment leadership structure which is how management monitors results and assesses performance the company has four major business segments consumer and business banking commercial banking vehicle finance regional banking and the huntington private client group rbhpcg the treasury other function includes technology and operations other unallocated assets liabilities revenue and expense for a description of our business segments see note huntington bancshares incorporated segment reporting to the consolidated financial statements of the corporations annual report on form 10k business segment results are determined based upon huntingtons management reporting system which assigns balance sheet and income statement items to each of the business segments the process is designed around the organizational and management structure and accordingly the results derived are not necessarily comparable with similar information published by other financial institutions additionally because of the interrelationships of the various segments the information presented is not indicative of how the segments would perform if they operated as independent entities huntington uses an active and centralized ftp methodology to attribute appropriate net interest income to the business segments the intent of the ftp methodology is to transfer interest rate risk from the business segments by providing matched duration funding of assets and liabilities the result is to centralize the financial impact management and reporting of interest rate risk in the treasury other function where it can be centrally monitored and managed the treasury other function charges credits an internal cost of funds for assets held in or pays for funding provided by each business segment the ftp rate is based on prevailing market interest rates for comparable duration assets or liabilities form 10q listed in the table below is
