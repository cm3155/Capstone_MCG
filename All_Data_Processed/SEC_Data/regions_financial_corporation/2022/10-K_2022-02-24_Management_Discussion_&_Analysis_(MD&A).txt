item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of regionss business particularly regarding its results cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within mda and the consolidated financial statements are included this summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided but should be read in conjunction with the entire mda and consolidated financial statements as well as the other sections of this annual report on s health pandemics government stimulus and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance these variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods in addition bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected additionally changes in circumstances related to individually large credits commodity prices or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility the scenarios discussed below or other scenarios have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ perhaps materially from the originally estimated amounts in addition it is difficult to predict how changes in economic conditions including changes resulting from various pandemic scenarios the impact of government stimulus programs to individuals and businesses and the timely distribution and efficacy of a vaccine could affect borrower behavior this analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions in june the frb released its estimated modeled credit losses for regions based on the december balance sheet the frb estimated credit losses in its severely adverse scenario of billion or percent see the federal reserve stress test disclosures at item business comprehensive capital analysis and review and stress testing for more information regarding their assumptions in this stress test it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable this unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario similar to the scenarios above it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans this scenario generated an increase in the modeled allowance of approximately million for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios fair value measurements a portion of the companys assets and liabilities is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss these include debt securities available for sale mortgage loans held for sale equity investments with and without readily determinable market values residential msrs and derivative assets and liabilities from time to time the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loanproperty or fair value less estimated costs to sell the property for example the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information less estimated selling costs adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity managements objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from modelbased techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on companyspecific data level valuations these unobservable assumptions reflect the companys own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily relationship assets agency commercial real estate licenses core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships goodwill totaled billion and billion at december and december respectively goodwill is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion accounting guidance permits the company to first assess qualitative factors to determine if it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value if based on the weight of the evidence the company determines it is more likely than not that the fair value exceeds book value then an impairment test is not necessary if the company elects to bypass the qualitative assessment or concludes that it is more likely than not that the fair value is less than the carrying value an impairment test is performed the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying amount including goodwill to the extent that the estimated fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value impairment is not indicated conversely if the estimated fair value of the reporting unit is below its carrying amount a loss which could be material would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated fair value the carrying value of equity for each reporting unit is determined from an allocation based upon risk weighted assets adverse changes in the economic environment declining operations of the reporting unit or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october by performing a qualitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether any indicators of impairment existed in performing the qualitative assessment the company evaluated events and circumstances since the last impairment analysis recent operating performance including reporting unit performance changes in market capitalization regulatory actions and assessments changes in the business climate companyspecific factors and trends in the banking industry after assessing the totality of the events and circumstances the company determined that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management reporting units exceed their respective carrying values therefore a quantitative impairment test was deemed unnecessary refer to note intangible assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of goodwill specific factors as of the date of filing the financial statements that could negatively impact the assumptions used in assessing goodwill for impairment include a protracted decline in the companys market capitalization adverse business trends resulting from litigation andor regulatory actions higher loan losses forecasts of high unemployment levels future increased minimum regulatory capital requirements above current thresholds refer to note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of current minimum regulatory requirements future federal rules and regulations eg such as those resulting from the doddfrank act andor a significant protraction in the current level of interest rates other identifiable intangible assets relationship intangible assets agency commercial real estate licenses core deposit intangibles and purchased credit card relationships are reviewed at least annually usually in the fourth quarter for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset these events could include loss of customer relationships loss of core deposits significant losses of credit card accounts andor balances increased competition or adverse changes in the economy to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount these events or circumstances if they occur could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated as of december the companys review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the intangible assets residential mortgage servicing rights regions has elected to measure and report its residential msrs using the fair value method although sales of residential msrs do occur residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available and are therefore level valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the fair value measurements section specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential msrs as a result regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics including loan type and contractual note rate and values its residential msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates discount rates escrow balances and servicing costs changes in interest rates prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential msrs which impacts earnings the carrying value of residential msrs was million at december based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis regions estimates that a reduction in benchmark interest rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december fair value of residential msrs by approximately percent million and percent million respectively conversely basis point and basis point increases in these rates would increase the december fair value of residential msrs by approximately percent million and percent million respectively regions also estimates that an increase in servicing costs of approximately per loan or percent would result in a decline in the value of the residential msrs by approximately million the pro forma fair value analyses presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates and servicing costs this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome refer to note servicing of financial assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on residential mortgage servicing rights income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect managements estimate of income taxes to be paid or received deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method the net balance is reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets the company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income the company utilizes forecasted pretax earnings adjusts for the estimated booktax differences and incorporates assumptions including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions these assumptions require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates the company uses to manage the underlying businesses the realization of the deferred tax assets could be reduced in the future if these estimates are significantly different than forecasted for a detailed discussion of realization of deferred tax assets refer to the income taxes section found later in this report the company is subject to income tax in the us and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction may be interpreted differently in certain situations which could result in a range of outcomes thus the company is required to exercise judgment regarding the application of these tax laws and regulations the company will evaluate and recognize tax liabilities related to any tax uncertainties due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is different from the current estimate of the tax liabilities the companys estimate of accrued income taxes deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions as well as changes in income tax rates any changes if they occur can be significant to the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details operating results net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals net interest income taxableequivalent basis increased by million in compared to the increase in net interest income was driven primarily by higher hedgerelated income lower funding costs a larger securities portfolio the acquisition of enerbank and increased ppp income while ppp loan balances declined during the year the fees related to loan forgiveness increased as the loan forgiveness process continued throughout in interest rates remained near historic lows regions asset yields were impacted by the low interest rate environment in particular the investment securities portfolio which contains significant residential fixedrate exposure declined in yield to percent in from percent in the yield decreased primarily due to reinvestment at lower yields addition of new securities at lower yields and higher premium amortization the increase in premium amortization was driven by higher recognized premium from securities purchases combined with increased prepayment speeds the loan portfolio yield declined to percent in from percent in the companys loan yields are primarily influenced by shortterm interest rates such as 30day libor which averaged percent in compared to percent in notably the hedging program which protects against lower shortterm rates contributed interest income of million for all of compared to million in this equates to a benefit of percent to loan yields in compared to percent in additionally continued reinvestment of fixedrate loans at lower longterm interest rates throughout contributed to the yield decrease the companys funding costs also declined in to percent as compared to percent in deposit costs decreased to basis points for compared to basis points for due primarily to continued lower interest rates and active deposit cost management coupled with a higher noninterestbearing balance mix the average longterm borrowing balance of billion in was lower than due to the redemption of parent and bank senior notes as well as early termination of fhlb secured funding sources while the interest expense declined the rate on these borrowings increased basis points primarily attributable to the remixing out of lowercost fhlb funding see the borrowed funds section and note borrowed funds to the consolidated financial statements for additional information net interest margin decreased to percent in from percent in the

and percent respectively the effective tax rate is higher in due primarily to a consistent level of permanent income tax preferences having a proportionally lower impact on higher pretax income the effective tax rate is affected by many factors including but not limited to the level of pretax income the mix of income between various tax jurisdictions with differing tax rates enacted tax legislation net tax benefits related to affordable housing investments bankowned life insurance income taxexempt interest and nondeductible expenses in addition the effective tax rate is affected by items that may occur in any given period but are not consistent from periodtoperiod such as the termination of certain leveraged leases sharebased payments valuation allowance changes and changes to unrecognized tax benefits accordingly the comparability of the effective tax rate between periods may be impacted at december the company reported a net deferred tax liability of million compared to a net deferred liability of million at december the decrease in the net deferred tax liability was due principally to the decrease in unrealized gains in available for sale securities and derivative instruments which was partially offset by a decrease in the deferred tax asset related to the allowance the company continually assesses the realizability of its deferred tax assets based on an evaluative process that considers all available positive and negative evidence a valuation allowance is recognized for a deferred tax asset if based on the weight of available evidence it is morelikelythannot that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized in determining whether a valuation allowance is necessary regions considers the level of taxable income in prior years to the extent that carrybacks are permitted under current tax laws as well as estimates of future pretax and taxable income and tax planning strategies that would if necessary be implemented based on this evaluative process the company established a valuation allowance in the amount of million at december and million at december because the company believes that a portion of state net operating loss carryforwards will not be utilized since regions expects to realize the remaining federal and state deferred tax assets no valuation allowance was deemed necessary against

described above were significant drivers of the modeled decreases in the allowance excluding the impact of enerbank while regions quantitative allowance methodologies strive to reflect all risk factors any estimate involves assumptions and uncertainties resulting in some level of imprecision the qualitative framework has a general imprecision component which is meant to acknowledge that model and forecast errors are inherent in any modeling estimate the december general imprecision allowance was reduced compared to the third quarter of but continues to reflect managements caution with respect to the modeled reductions in the allowance given uncertainties such as concerns about new covid19 variants lingering supply chain issues and inflation based on the overall analysis
