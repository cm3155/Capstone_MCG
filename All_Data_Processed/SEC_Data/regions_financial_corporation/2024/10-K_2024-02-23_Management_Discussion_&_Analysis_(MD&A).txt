item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive overview management believes the following sections provide an overview of several of the most relevant matters necessary for an understanding of the financial aspects of regionss business particularly regarding its results cross references to more detailed information regarding each topic within mda and the consolidated financial statements are included this summary is intended to assist in understanding the information provided but should be read in conjunction with the entire mda and consolidated financial statements as well as the other sections of this annual report on s health pandemics government stimulus and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts floods and hurricanes management considers these variables and all other available information when establishing the final level of the allowance these variables and others have the ability to result in actual loan losses that differ from the originally estimated amounts changes in the factors used by management to determine the appropriateness of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance to be increased or decreased in future periods in addition bank regulatory agencies as part of their examination process may require changes in the level of allowance based on their judgments and estimates volatility in certain credit metrics is to be expected additionally changes in circumstances related to individually large credits commodity prices or certain macroeconomic forecast assumptions may result in volatility the scenarios discussed below or other scenarios have the ability to result in actual credit losses that differ perhaps materially from the originally estimated amounts this analysis is not intended to estimate changes in the overall allowance which would also be influenced by the judgment management applies to the modeled loss estimates to reflect uncertainty and imprecision based on thencurrent circumstances and conditions it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in any one economic factor might affect the overall allowance because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in the allowance estimate changes in the factors and inputs may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types additionally changes in factors and inputs may be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others however to consider the impact of a hypothetical alternate economic forecast regions estimated the allowance using a scenario that was one standard deviation unfavorable to the expected scenario for each macroeconomic variable this unfavorable scenario resulted in an allowance approximately percent higher than the allowance using the expected scenario similar to the scenarios above it is difficult to estimate how potential changes in credit risk factors might affect the overall allowance because of the wide variety of credit risk factors that are considered in estimating the allowance changes in risk ratings may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across product or industry types regions conducted a separate sensitivity analysis considering deteriorating conditions for commercial and investor real estate portfolio factors by stressing key portfolio drivers relative to the baseline portfolio conditions regions stressed risk ratings by one downgrade for commercial and investor real estate loans this scenario generated an increase in the modeled allowance of approximately million for the commercial and investor real estate portfolios fair value measurements a portion of the companys assets and liabilities is carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded either in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income loss these include debt securities available for sale mortgage loans held for sale equity investments with and without readily determinable market values residential msrs and derivative assets and liabilities from time to time the estimation of fair value also affects other loans held for sale which are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value fair value determination is also relevant for certain other assets such as foreclosed property and other real estate which are recorded at the lower of the recorded investment in the loanproperty or fair value less estimated costs to sell the property for example the fair value of other real estate is determined based on recent appraisals by third parties and other market information less estimated selling costs adjustments to the appraised value are made if management becomes aware of changes in the fair value of specific properties or property types the determination of fair value also impacts certain other assets that are periodically evaluated for impairment using fair value estimates including goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets fair value is generally defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price as opposed to the price that would be paid to acquire the asset or received to assume the liability an entry price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions while management uses judgment when determining the price at which willing market participants would transact when there has been a significant decrease in the volume or level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity managements objective is to determine the point within the range of fair value estimates that is most representative of a sale to a thirdparty investor under current market conditions the value to the company if the asset or liability were held to maturity is not included in the fair value estimates a fair value measure should reflect the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including the assumptions about the risk inherent in a particular valuation technique the effect of a restriction on the sale or use of an asset and the risk of nonperformance fair value is measured based on a variety of inputs the company utilizes fair value may be based on quoted market prices for identical assets or liabilities traded in active markets level valuations if market prices are not available quoted market prices for similar instruments traded in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active and modelbased valuation techniques for which all significant assumptions are observable in the market are used level valuations where observable market data is not available the valuation is generated from modelbased techniques that use significant assumptions not observable in the market but observable based on companyspecific data level valuations these unobservable assumptions reflect the companys own estimates for assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability valuation techniques typically include option pricing models discounted cash flow models and similar techniques but may also include the use of market prices of assets or liabilities that are not directly comparable to the subject asset or liability see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of determining fair value including pricing validation processes intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses goodwill totaled billion at both december and december goodwill is allocated to each of regions reportable segments each a reporting unit corporate bank consumer bank and wealth management goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis as of october or more often if events and circumstances indicate impairment may exist refer to note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of october the company elected to bypass the qualitative assessment and performed a quantitative assessment of goodwill at the reporting unit level to determine whether the fair value exceeded the carrying value in performing the quantitative assessment the estimated fair value of the reporting unit was determined using a blend of both income and market approaches the results of the goodwill impairment test did not require regions to record a goodwill impairment charge as all three reporting units continued to have a fair value in excess of carrying value other identifiable intangible assets such as relationship assets and agency commercial real estate licenses are reviewed at least annually usually in the fourth quarter for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset these events could include loss of customer relationships increased competition or adverse changes in the economy to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount these events or circumstances if they occur could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period but the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated as of december the companys review indicated there was no impairment in the value of the other identifiable intangible assets residential mortgage servicing rights regions has elected to measure and report its residential msrs using the fair value method although sales of residential msrs do occur residential msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices and the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available and are therefore level valuations in the fair value hierarchy previously discussed in the fair value measurements section specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the estimated value of the related residential msrs as a result regions stratifies its residential mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics including loan type and contractual note rate and values its residential msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows taking into consideration historical and forecasted residential mortgage loan prepayment rates discount rates escrow balances and servicing costs changes in interest rates prepayment speeds or other factors impact the fair value of residential msrs which impacts earnings refer to note servicing of financial assets to the consolidated financial statements for quantitative disclosures reflecting the effect that changes in managements assumptions would have on the fair value of residential msrs refer to note servicing of financial assets to the consolidated financial statements for additional disclosure on residential mortgage servicing rights income taxes accrued income taxes are reported as a component of either other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets and reflect managements estimate of income taxes to be paid or received the company is subject to income tax in the us and multiple state and local jurisdictions the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the company and the relevant government taxing authorities therefore the company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the companys tax positions including evaluating uncertain tax positions deferred income taxes represent the amount of future income taxes to be paid or received and are accounted for using the asset and liability method with the net balance reported in other assets or other liabilities as appropriate in the consolidated balance sheets the company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies in projecting future taxable income the company utilizes forecasted pretax earnings adjusts for the estimated temporary differences and incorporates assumptions including the amounts of income allocable to taxing jurisdictions determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikely thannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized the company currently maintains a valuation allowance for certain state carryforwards the companys estimate of accrued income taxes deferred income taxes and income tax expense can also change in any period as a result of new legislative or judicial guidance impacting tax positions as well as changes in income tax rates and changes in operating activities any changes if they occur can be significant to the companys consolidated financial position results of operations or cash flows see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion operating results net interest income and net interest margin net interest income is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals in balance sheet and net interest income performance were the result of postpandemic normalization and tightening monetary policy including a higher interest rate environment both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and the fomc increased the fed funds rate by basis points during the year ended december see the executive overview for a discussion of recent fomc activity and expectations for net interest income that incorporates anticipated fomc activity net interest income taxableequivalent basis increased by million in compared to and net interest margin increased by basis points to percent in the increases in net interest income and net interest margin were driven primarily by significantly higher shortterm and longterm market interest rates and average loan growth the loan portfolio yield inclusive of hedging impacts increased to percent in from percent in the companys loan yields are primarily influenced by shortterm interest rates such as 30day term sofr which averaged percent in compared to percent in additionally fixedrate lending production which contains significant residential mortgage fixedrate exposure benefited from higher middle and longterm rates while the company temporarily slowed reinvestment within the investment securities portfolio for much of it had returned to full reinvestment by the fourth quarter the investment securities portfolio benefited from rising rates with the yield increasing to percent in from percent in deposit and funding cost normalization which are expected in a rising rate environment and were further influenced by bank industry stresses during the year partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin driven by loans and investment securities in funding costs which includes deposits and wholesale borrowings utilized during the year increased to percent compared to percent in the increase in funding costs includes the impact of deposit remixing as depositors moved into higher interest earning products deposit costs increased to basis points for compared to basis points for additionally net interest margin benefited from earning asset remixing out of cash balances held with the federal reserve bank which are the primary component of interestbearing deposits in other banks shown in table in elevated cash balances were held to fund anticipated postpandemic deposit outflows reducing the net interest margin in that period cash

in the interest rate environment product pricing balance sheet mix and balance sheet growth over recent years changes in the interest rate environment and the impact on product pricing and mix has been the primary contributor to changes in net interest income the mix of earning assets can affect the interest rate spread regions primary types of earning assets are loans and investment securities certain types of earning assets have historically generated larger spreads for example loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets such as securities or interestbearing deposits in other banks average earning assets in totaled billion a decrease of billion as compared to the prior year primarily due to a decrease in interestbearing deposits in other banks offset by a growth in loans

which was percent in both and measures the effectiveness of managements efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable earning instruments the mix of interestbearing liabilities can also affect the interest spread funding for regions earning assets comes from interestbearing and noninterestbearing sources as previously discussed in the company experienced deposit balance declines and remixing into higher interest bearing deposit categories as the percentage of earning assets funded by deposits declined during the year the company utilized short and longterm wholesale borrowings the changes to interestbearing liabilities partially offset increases to net interest income and margin provision for benefit from credit losses the provision for credit losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit losses at a level that in managements judgment is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the contractual life of the loan and credit commitment portfolio at the balance sheet date during the provision for credit losses totaled million and net chargeoffs were million this compares to a provision for credit losses of million
