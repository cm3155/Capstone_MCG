service and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations as well as electronic and mobile banking regions profitability like that of many other financial institutions is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as noninterest income sources net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income regions receives on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and the interest expense regions pays on interestbearing liabilities principally deposits and borrowings regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities noninterest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts card and atm fees mortgage servicing and secondary marketing investment management and trust activities capital markets and other customer services which regions provides results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits equipment and software expense occupancy professional legal and regulatory expenses fdic insurance assessments and other operating expenses as well as income taxes economic conditions competition new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most if not all financial institutions including regions lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment consumer income consumer spending and savings capital market activities and competition among financial institutions as well as customer preferences interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions market areas third quarter overview third quarter operating environment in the first half of the banking industry was impacted by the failure of three us depository institutions outside of the us an international bank also suffered a crisis in confidence the circumstances surrounding these events were largely driven by a sudden decline in deposits and lack of available liquidity to replace the deposit declines at the institutions in march the btfp was created by the federal reserve to support american businesses and households by making additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors as an additional source of secured funding backed by highquality securities eliminating an institutions need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress in addition to the uncertainty brought by these events in the first nine months of the federal reserve delivered four additional basispoint rate hikes as inflation continued to stay above target levels accordingly there is now heightened focus on the banking industry as a whole regions believes that its deposits are diversified across categories and are granular in nature which lessens the probability of sudden declines in deposits additionally regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations and performs various evaluations to determine appropriate levels of available liquidity see the discussion below and within the debt securities deposits market riskinterest rate risk and liquidity sections for further information economic environment in regions banking markets regions baseline forecast anticipates fullyear real gdp growth of percent in followed by growth of percent in and percent in despite the cumulative effects of elevated inflation and higher interest rates the economy remained resilient through the summer months with the us bureau of economic analysis initial estimate of real gdp growth at an annualized rate of percent in the third quarter the pace of economic activity is however expected to slow sharply in the fourth quarter and remain somewhat subdued through the first half of before picking up in the second half of and into interestsensitive segments of the economy including housing business fixed investment and consumer durable goods are expected to soften further in the months ahead spending on discretionary services such as travel tourism recreation entertainment and dining out was a key driver of growth in consumer spending over the summer months but is showing signs of fading regions expects sluggish growth in total inflationadjusted consumer spending over the next few quarters while there is still a considerable pool of excess savings on household balance sheets those balances are being run off as the cumulative effects of higher inflation and higher interest rates continue to stress household budgets monthly debt service burdens remain below prepandemic levels due to the preponderance of fixedrate debt on household balance sheets measurement issues and strike activity have injected a high degree of noise into estimates of monthly job growth but the underlying trend rate of job growth is slowing at the same time job growth has been less broadly based across private sector industry groups and hours worked are well off the cycle high slowing job growth has thus far been strictly a function of a slowing hiring rate as the rate at which workers are being laid off remains slightly below prepandemic norms still regions baseline forecast anticipates further deceleration in job growth to push the unemployment rate higher over coming quarters while inflation has slowed it remains well above the fomcs target rate while this may not prompt the fomc to raise the fed funds rate further it suggests rate cuts may be later in coming than market participants are generally expecting higher interest rates and tighter financial conditions are impacting inflation and as such may substitute for additional funds rate hikes higher interest rates will contribute to a slowing pace of economic activity and further deceleration in inflation which management believes will keep the fomc from raising the funds rate further either way once the fomc reaches a stopping point regions expects them to hold the funds rate steady at the terminal rate for some time to come the economic data and the financial markets remain quite volatile and there are lingering concerns that credit conditions could tighten to the point the economy slips into recession these factors are contributing to considerable uncertainty around the nearterm economic outlook patterns of economic activity within the regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen for the us as a whole a number of infootprint states have seen heightened flows of domestic inmigration since the onset of the pandemic which has resulted in more rapid rates of job growth and more rapid growth in housing costs if as regions anticipates the broader economy slows and labor market conditions loosen it could be that migration patterns will shift over coming quarters job growth for the companys footprint as a whole is expected to be faster than that for the us as a whole some of the metro areas which had prior to the increase in mortgage interest rates seen the largest increases in house prices could experience price declines in excess of the national average but continued robust population growth in these markets will help stem the extent of any declines in house prices the continued economic uncertainty as described above impacted regions forecast utilized in calculating the acl as of september see the allowance section for

taxes net of the related federal tax benefit net interest income is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and in the first nine months of the fomc increased the fed funds rate by basis points see the third quarter overview for a discussion of recent fomc activity net interest income taxableequivalent basis and net interest margin increased in both the third quarter and first nine months of compared to the same periods in the increases were driven primarily by significantly higher shortterm and longterm interest rates and higher average loan balances due to the rising rate environment deposit and funding cost normalization which includes the impact of deposit remixing partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin additionally offsetting the increase in the third quarter of approximately billion of hedges became active which reduce net interest income in the current rate environment market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers as its primary tool to analyze this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk in addition to net interest income simulations regions also utilizes an eve analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longerterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates importantly eve values only the current balance sheet does not incorporate the balance sheet growth assumptions used in the net interest income sensitivity analyses and results are highly dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities the imprecise assumptions in preparing an eve analysis limit its efficacy sensitivity measurementfinancial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates see the third quarter overview section for details on expectations for net interest income in the set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes in addition to parallel rate shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movementsregions balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates and decreasing with lower interest rates this is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices and funding from a large mostly stable retail deposit portfolio importantly the stability and rate sensitivity of regions deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles with this natural balance sheet profile the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through cash flow hedges is critical to mitigate the banks naturally asset sensitive position as of september regions evidenced a mostly balanced assetliability position with an asset duration of approximately years and a liability duration of approximately years using historicallyinformed approximations the securities portfolio duration was approximately years and is appropriate for regions risk profile in order to offset the longduration deposit liabilities while the available for sale securities and cash flow hedging portfolios are recorded on the balance sheet including current unrealized losses deposit value increases have more than offset these losses through the rising rate environment the additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment is realized in the form of lowercost funding when compared with wholesale sources while balance sheet analysis particularly eve analysis does contemplate the economic value of deposits the estimated fair value of deposits is equal to their carrying value for certain financial statement footnote disclosures consistent with industry practices see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information as of september regions net interest income profile was mostly neutral to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12month measurement horizon ending september the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates an increase or reduction in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves sofr and bsby will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower under either environment it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will mostly offset the change in asset yields net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and longterm yield curve tenors while this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises and remains elevated an increase in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swaps and mortgage rates will drive yields higher on certain fixedrate newly originated or renewed loans increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and longterm interest rates fall the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with tightening monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include managements best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming months in the first nine months of regions experienced a decline in deposit balances both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies as well as from latecycle rate seeking behavior by higherbalance customers yet those declines slowed during the third quarter the baseline projects deposit balances to be stable to modestly lower over the forecast horizon assuming runoff mimics the expected total deposit mix an additional deposit outflow of billion would reduce net interest income by million over months in the parallel basis point scenario in table conversely if an additional billion are retained a positive benefit of million would be expected over months in the parallel basis point scenario in table while the base case estimates stabilizing deposit balances in aggregate additional remixing of approximately billion to billion out of lowcost deposit categories and into highcost deposit categories is anticipated through mid2024 in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will further change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles importantly much of the anticipated mix shift has already occurred or is expected to occur within the baseline scenario the magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the parallel basis point scenario in table furthermore over the month horizon an increase of billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately million and a decrease of billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by million the deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time in the base case scenario management expects an approximate percent full cycle interestbearing deposit beta by yearend the parallel basis point shock scenario in table also incorporates an incremental beta of approximately percent above the base case scenario incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of percent in the parallel basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately million the table below summarizes regions positioning over the next months in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate

also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts forward sale commitments futures contracts interest rate swaps interest rate options caps floors and collars and contracts with a combination of these instruments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate

levels as disclosed in table regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers interest rate swaps interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to

supplemented by regions deposit base cash reserves liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions andor meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation as part of its normal management practice regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as fhlb frb or btfp on a sameday basis subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants while the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity the secured borrowing capabilities in addition to cash reserves on hand assist in alleviating the companys need to sell securities for funding purposes liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in

security risks such as evolving and adaptive cyberattacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems such attempts have increased in recent years and the trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons including increases in technologybased products and services used by regions and the companys customers the growing use of mobile cloud and other emerging technologies and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees even when regions successfully prevents cyberattacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks that enable customer transactions the related fraud losses as well as the costs of reissuing new cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of a cyberattack or other data breach regions may be required to incur significant expenses including with respect to remediation costs costs of implementing additional preventative measures addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event refer to the information security risk section in managements discussion and analysis included in the annual report on form 10k for the year ended december for further discussion of regions
