regarding regions segment reporting structure regions business strategy is focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services delivering quality customer service and continuing to develop and optimize distribution channels that include a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations as well as electronic and mobile banking regions profitability like that of many other financial institutions is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income as well as noninterest income sources net interest income is primarily the difference between the interest income regions receives on interestearning assets such as loans and securities and the interest expense regions pays on interestbearing liabilities principally deposits and borrowings regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities noninterest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts card and atm fees mortgage servicing and secondary marketing investment management and trust activities capital markets and other customer services which regions provides results of operations are also affected by the provision for credit losses and noninterest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits occupancy professional legal and regulatory expenses fdic insurance assessments and other operating expenses as well as income taxes economic conditions competition new legislation and related rules impacting regulation of the financial services industry and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most if not all financial institutions including regions lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment consumer income consumer spending and savings capital market activities and competition among financial institutions as well as customer preferences interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions market areas second quarter overview second quarter operating environment in the first six months of the banking industry was impacted by the failure of three us depository institutions outside of the us an international bank also suffered a crisis in confidence the circumstances surrounding these events were largely driven by a sudden decline in deposits and lack of available liquidity to replace the deposit declines at the institutions in march the btfp was created by the federal reserve to support american businesses and households by making additional funding available to eligible depository institutions to help assure banks have the ability to meet the needs of all their depositors as an additional source of secured funding backed by highquality securities eliminating an institutions need to quickly sell those securities in times of stress in addition to the uncertainty brought by these events the federal reserve delivered three additional basispoint rate hikes as inflation continued to stay above target levels accordingly there is now heightened focus on the banking industry as a whole regions believes that its deposits are diversified across stable categories and are granular in nature which lessens the probability of sudden declines in deposits additionally regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations and performs various evaluations to determine appropriate levels of available liquidity see the discussion below and within the debt securities deposits market riskinterest rate risk and liquidity sections for further information economic environment in regions banking markets regions baseline forecast anticipates real gdp growth of percent in and percent in the pace of economic activity remains restrained by elevated inflation and higher interest rates though real gdp growth surprised to the upside over the first half of regions forecast anticipates markedly slower growth over the coming quarters reflecting slower growth in real consumer spending and weakness in business spending on equipment and machinery though single family construction and sales appear to have bottomed it remains to be seen whether the developing rebound can withstand the recent upturn in mortgage interest rates while the labor market remains tight there are signs of cooling demand for labor and job growth has become less broadly based over recent months though the pace of inflation has slowed it remains considerably above the fomcs target rate and further hikes in the fed funds rate in cannot be ruled out the economic data and the financial markets remain quite volatile and there are lingering concerns that credit conditions could tighten to the point the economy slips into recession these factors are contributing to considerable uncertainty around the companys nearterm economic outlook spending on motor vehicles and discretionary services such as travel tourism recreation entertainment and dining out have been key supports for consumer spending over recent months at some point however it is expected that spending in both areas will slow combining with continued softness in consumer spending on goods to limit growth in total consumer spending while there is still a considerable pool of excess savings on household balance sheets those balances are being run off as the cumulative effects of higher inflation and higher interest rates continue to stress household budgets that said monthly debt service burdens remain below prepandemic levels due to the preponderance of fixedrate debt on household balance sheets reflecting decelerating job growth and declines in the average length of the workweek growth in labor earnings has slowed and will slow further over coming quarters if job growth slows as anticipated job growth has become less broadly based across private sector industry groups over recent months with notable weakness in trade transportation and warehousing manufacturing payrolls have come under pressure as conditions in the factory sector remain challenging reflecting dimming capital spending on equipment and machinery inventories having largely been rightsized after pandemicrelated disruptions and slowing global economic growth regions baseline forecast anticipates further deceleration in job growth to push the unemployment rate higher over coming quarters while inflation has slowed somewhat over recent months both headline and core inflation remain well above the fomcs percent target rate while inflation pressures are expected to ease further as the pace of the overall economic activity slows the fomc is not yet convinced inflation is firmly on a path back to their target rate as such further fed funds rate hikes cannot be ruled out particularly as headline inflation is showing signs of reaccelerating the fomc must balance concerns over inflation against concerns over financial stability in light of recent stresses in the banking system either way once the fomc reaches a stopping point regions thinks they will hold the funds rate steady at the terminal rate for some time to come patterns of economic activity within the regions footprint are expected to be broadly similar to those seen in the us as a whole a number of states within the footprint have seen heightened flows of domestic inmigration since the onset of the pandemic which has resulted in more rapid rates of job growth and more rapid growth in housing costs if as anticipated the broader economy slows and labor market conditions loosen it could be that migration patterns will shift over coming quarters that said job growth for the companys footprint as a whole is expected to be faster than that for the us as a whole some of the metro areas which had prior to the increase in mortgage interest rates seen the largest increases in house prices could experience price declines in excess of the national average but continued robust population growth in these markets will help stem significant declines in house prices the continued economic uncertainty as described above impacted regions forecast utilized in calculating the acl as of june see the allowance section for further information second quarter results regions reported

taxableequivalent basis was percent in the second quarter of reflecting a basis point increase from the same period in the increases in net interest income and net interest margin were primarily driven by a significant increase in market interest rates and average loan growth a decline in average cash balances also contributed to the increase in net interest margin higher deposit and overall funding costs which are expected in a rising rate environment partially offset the increases in interest income the provision for credit losses totaled million in the second quarter of compared to

its overall performance goals both net interest income and net interest margin are influenced by market interest rates and in the first six months of the fomc increased the fed funds rate by basis points see the second quarter overview for a discussion of recent fomc activity net interest income taxableequivalent basis and net interest margin increased in both the second quarter and first six months of compared to the same periods in the increases were driven primarily by significantly higher shortterm and longterm interest rates and higher average loan balances higher deposit and funding costs due to the rising rate environment partially offset the increases in net interest income and net interest margin market riskinterest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk this includes uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as relative interest rate levels which are impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers as its primary tool to analyze this risk regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario net interest income sensitivity to market rate movements is a useful shortterm indicator of regions interest rate risk in addition to net interest income simulations regions also utilizes an eve analysis as a measurement tool to estimate risk exposure over a longerterm horizon eve measures the extent to which the economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet instruments may change in response to fluctuations in interest rates importantly eve values only the current balance sheet does not incorporate the balance sheet growth assumptions used in the net interest income sensitivity analyses and results are highly dependent on imprecise assumptions for products with embedded prepay optionality and indeterminate maturities the imprecise assumptions in preparing an eve analysis limit its efficacy sensitivity measurementfinancial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet assumptions are made about the direction and magnitude of interest rate movements the slope of the yield curve and the changing composition of the balance sheet that results from both strategic plans and customer behavior among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business interest raterelated risks are expressly considered such as pricing spreads the pricing of deposit accounts prepayments and other option risks regions considers these factors as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior the primary objective of assetliability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles in computing interest rate sensitivity regions compares a set of alternative interest rate scenarios to the results of a base case scenario derived using market forward rates see the second quarter overview section for details on expectations for net interest income in the set of alternative interest rate scenarios includes instantaneous parallel rate shifts of various magnitudes in addition to parallel rate shifts multiple curve steepening and flattening scenarios are contemplated regions includes simulations of gradual interest rate movements phased in over a sixmonth period that may more realistically mimic the speed of potential interest rate movements exposure to interest rate movementsregions balance sheet is naturally asset sensitive with net interest income increasing with higher interest rates and decreasing with lower interest rates this is the result of approximately half of the loan portfolio floating contractually with market rate indices and funding from a large mostly stable retail deposit portfolio importantly the stability and rate sensitivity of regions deposit portfolio has been proven over multiple interest rate cycles with this natural balance sheet profile the ability to utilize discretionary asset duration strategies within the investment portfolio and through cash flow hedges is critical for interest rate risk management as of june regions evidenced a mostly balanced assetliability position with an asset duration of approximately years and a liability duration of approximately years using historicallyinformed approximations the securities portfolio duration was approximately years and is appropriate for regions risk profile in order to offset the longduration deposit liabilities while the available for sale securities and cash flow hedging portfolios are recorded on the balance sheet including current unrealized losses deposit value increases have more than offset these losses through the rising rate environment the additional value of deposits in a higher rate environment will be realized in the form of lowercost funding when compared with wholesale sources deposits are recorded on the balance sheet at carrying value and for certain financial statement footnote disclosures the estimated fair value of deposits with no stated maturity is equal to their carrying value consistent with industry practices however in the sensitivity analysis of the balance sheet management does contemplate a fair value of deposits with no stated maturity see note fair value measurements to the consolidated financial statements for additional information as of june regions was asset sensitive to both gradual and instantaneous parallel yield curve shifts as compared to the base case for the 12month measurement horizon ending june the estimated exposure associated with the rising and falling rate scenarios in table below reflects the combined impacts of movements in shortterm and longterm interest rates an increase or reduction in shortterm interest rates such as the fed funds rate the rate of interest on excess reserves sofr and bsby will drive the yield on assets and liabilities contractually tied to such rates higher or lower under either environment it is expected that changes in funding costs and balance sheet hedging income will only somewhat offset the change in asset yields net interest income remains exposed to intermediate and longterm yield curve tenors while this was a headwind to net interest income during a low rate environment it represents a tailwind to net interest income growth as the yield curve rises and remains elevated an increase in intermediate and longterm interest rates such as intermediate to longerterm us treasuries swaps and mortgage rates will drive yields higher on certain fixedrate newly originated or renewed loans increase prospective yields on certain investment portfolio purchases and reduce amortization of premium expense on existing securities in the investment portfolio the opposite is true in an environment where intermediate and longterm interest rates fall the interest rate sensitivity analysis presented below in table is informed by a variety of assumptions and estimates regarding the progression of the balance sheet in both the baseline scenario as well as the scenarios of instantaneous and gradual shifts in the yield curve though there are many assumptions which affect the estimates for net interest income those pertaining to deposit pricing deposit mix and overall balance sheet composition are particularly impactful given the uncertainties associated with tightening monetary policy on industry liquidity levels and the cost of that liquidity management evaluates the impacts from these key assumptions through sensitivity analysis sensitivity calculations are hypothetical and should not be considered to be predictive of future results the companys baseline balance sheet assumptions include managements best estimate for balance sheet changes in the coming months in the first six months of regions experienced a decline in lowcost deposit balances both from the normalization of balances acquired from stimulative policies as well as from latecycle rate seeking behavior by higherbalance customers the baseline projects deposit balances to decline modestly through the end of the year assuming runoff mimics the expected total deposit mix an additional deposit outflow of billion would reduce net interest income by million over months in the parallel basis point scenario in table conversely if an additional billion are retained a positive benefit of million would be expected over months in the parallel basis point scenario in table in rising rate scenarios only management assumes that the mix of legacy deposits will change versus the base case as informed by analyses of prior rate cycles management assumes that in rising rate scenarios some remixing shift from noninterestbearing to interestbearing products will occur the magnitude of the remixing shift is rate dependent and equates to approximately billion over months in the parallel basis point scenario in table furthermore over the month horizon an increase of billion in deposit remixing would decrease net interest income by approximately million and a decrease of billion in deposit remixing would increase net interest income by million the deposit beta is calibrated using the experience from prior rate cycles and is dynamic across both interest rate level and time in the base case scenario management expects an approximate percent full cycle interestbearing deposit beta by yearend and for the beta to drift towards percent in the parallel basis point shock scenario in table also incorporates an incremental beta of approximately percent above the base case scenario incremental deposit pricing outperformance or underperformance of percent in the parallel basis point shock would increase or decrease net interest income by approximately million the table below summarizes regions positioning over the next months in various parallel yield curve shifts ie including all yield curve tenors the scenarios are inclusive of all interest rate

active cash flow hedges including forward starting hedges are reflected within the measurement horizon see table for additional information regarding hedge start and maturity dates regions comprehensive interest rate risk management approach uses derivatives as discussed further below and debt securities to manage its interest rate risk position during the second quarter of the company did not engage in meaningful hedging transactions since june the company executed transactions to opportunistically extend incremental downside rate protection over a longer horizon and reduce exposure to large falling rate movements the company added billion of forward starting swaps which will become active in and mature years from their start dates the receive fixed rates on these cash flow hedges averaged percent paying overnight sofr the company also added million of forward starting interest rate options which will become active in and mature years from their start dates these options were constructed with net purchased interest rate floors at a weightedaverage strike of percent to offset the cost of these floors the strategy includes sold interest rate caps with a weightedaverage strike of percent interest rate movements may also have an impact on the value of regions securities portfolio which can directly impact the carrying value of shareholders equity derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity alco which consists of members of regions senior management team in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies derivatives are also used to offset the risks associated with customer derivatives which include interest rate credit and foreign exchange risks the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts forward sale commitments futures contracts interest rate swaps interest rate options caps floors and collars and contracts with a combination of these instruments forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates because futures contracts are cash settled daily there is minimal credit risk associated with futures interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreedupon price foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate these contracts are executed on behalf of the companys customers and are used by customers to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform regions has made use of interest rate swaps and options in balance sheet hedging strategies to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate funding position to a variablerate position to effectively convert a portion of its fixedrate debt securities available for sale portfolio to a variablerate position and to effectively convert a portion of its floatingrate loan portfolios to fixedrate regions also uses derivatives to economically manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this heldforsale

measurement horizon and included in income sensitivity levels as disclosed in table regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolios by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions for nondealer transactions the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from andor posted to that counterparty most hedging interest rate swap derivatives traded by regions are subject to mandatory clearing the counterparty risk for cleared trades effectively moves from the executing broker to the clearinghouse allowing regions to benefit from the risk mitigation controls in place at the respective clearinghouse the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers interest rate swaps interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers other derivative instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of income the primary objective of regions hedging

sufficient to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers under normal and stressed conditions accordingly regions maintains a variety of liquidity sources to fund its obligations as further described below see also note commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of the companys funding requirements furthermore regions performs specific procedures including scenario analyses and stress testing to evaluate and maintain appropriate levels of available liquidity in alignment with liquidity risk regions operation of its business provides a generally balanced liquidity base which is comprised of customer assets consisting principally of loans and funding provided by customer deposits and borrowed funds maturities in the loan portfolio provide a steady flow of funds and are supplemented by regions deposit base cash reserves liquid assets and secured borrowing capabilities aid in the management of liquidity in normal and stressed conditions andor meeting the need of contingent events such as obligations related to potential litigation as part of its normal management practice regions maintains collateral and operational readiness to utilize secured funding sources such as fhlb frb or btfp on a sameday basis subject to any practical constraints affecting these market participants while the securities portfolio is a primary source of liquidity the secured borrowing capabilities in addition to cash reserves on hand assist in alleviating the companys need to sell securities for funding purposes liquidity needs can also be met by borrowing funds in national money markets though regions does maintain limits on shortterm unsecured funding due to the volatility that can affect such markets the following table summarizes the companys available sources of liquidity as of june table 21liquidity sources availability as of june in billions cash at the frb liquid securities free

collateral of approximately billion at june the balance with the frb is the primary component of the balance sheet line item interestbearing deposits in other banks at june regions had approximately billion in cash on deposit with the frb and other depository institutions a decrease from approximately billion at december partially driven by the expected decline in deposits during the period refer to the cash and cash equivalents and deposits sections for more information the securities portfolio also serves as a primary source and storehouse of liquidity proceeds from maturities and principal and interest payments of securities provide a continual flow of funds available for cash needs see note debt securities to the consolidated financial statements furthermore the highly liquid nature of the available for sale securities portfolio for example the agency guaranteed mbs portfolio can be readily used as a source of cash through various secured borrowing arrangements including the btfp in march the federal reserve created the btfp as an additional liquidity source under which securities may be pledged at their par value for a lending arrangement up to one year in length regions securities portfolio consists of us treasury securities federal agency securities mbs and corporate and other debt in evaluating the liquidity within the securities portfolio liquid securities free to

earlier in this report for further information regarding the risk characteristics of each loan type see further discussion of the current us economic environment in the economic environment in regions banking markets section information security risk regions faces information security risks such as evolving and adaptive cyberattacks that are conducted regularly against financial institutions in attempts to compromise or disable information systems such attempts have increased in recent years and the trend is expected to continue for a number of reasons including increases in technologybased products and services used by us and our customers the growing use of mobile cloud and other emerging technologies and the increasing sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties or fraud on the part of employees even when regions successfully prevents cyberattacks to its own network the company may still incur losses that result from customers account information being obtained through breaches of retailers networks that enable customer transactions the related fraud losses as well as the costs of reissuing new cards may impact regions financial results in addition regions also relies on some vendors to provide certain business infrastructure components and although regions actively assesses and monitors the information security capabilities of these vendors regions reliance on them may also increase exposure to information security risk in the event of a cyberattack or other data breach regions may be required to incur significant expenses including with respect to remediation costs costs of implementing additional preventative measures addressing any reputational harm and addressing any related regulatory inquiries or civil litigation arising from the event refer to the information security risk section in managements discussion and analysis included in the annual report on form 10k for the
