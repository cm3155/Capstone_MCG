item risk factors an investment in the company involves risks some of which including market liquidity credit operational legal compliance reputational and strategic risks could be substantial and is inherent in our business these risks also includes the possibility that the value of the investment could decrease considerably and dividends or other distributions concerning the investment could be reduced or eliminated discussed below are risk factors that could adversely affect our financial results and condition as well as the value of and return on investment in the company risks related to the operation of our business our businesses have been and may continue to be adversely affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally we provide traditional commercial retail and mortgage banking services as well as other financial services including asset management wealth management securities brokerage mergerandacquisition advisory services and other specialty financing all of our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the financial markets and economic conditions generally or specifically in the southeastern us the principal markets in which we conduct business a worsening of business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business could have adverse effects on our business including the following a decrease in the demand for or the availability of loans and other products and services offered by us a decrease in the value of our loans held for sale or other assets secured by consumer or commercial real estate an impairment of certain intangible assets such as goodwill a decrease in interest income from variable rate loans due to declines in interest rates and an increase in the number of clients and counterparties who become delinquent file for protection under bankruptcy laws or default on their loans or other obligations to us which could result in a higher level of nonperforming assets net chargeoffs provisions for credit losses and valuation adjustments on loans held for sale in the event of severely adverse business and economic conditions generally or specifically in the principal markets in which we conduct business there can be no assurance that the federal government and the federal reserve would intervene further the ultimate success of measures taken in response to the covid19 pandemic remains unknown and these measures may not be sufficient to address the effects of the covid19 pandemic or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity if economic conditions worsen or volatility increases our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created disruptions that have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations we cannot predict the extent to which the pandemic will continue to cause such adverse effects the extent of any continued or future adverse effects will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and outside our control including the scope and duration of the covid19 pandemic and its impact on our employees clients customers counterparties and service providers as well as other market participants circumstances brought about by the pandemic persist including worsened economic conditions increased market volatility ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults reductions in the targeted federal funds rate and increased spending on business continuity efforts which may require that we reduce costs and investments in other areas should the pandemic continue for a more extended period or worsen we may face additional circumstances such as significant draws on credit lines should customers seek to increase liquidity we are offering assistance to support customers experiencing financial hardships related to the pandemic if such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the pandemic on borrowers we may experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in the future we may also have to provide additional assistance or otherwise experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses further we have approximately billion in ppp loans as of yearend and have provided additional ppp loans including second draw loans in these efforts may affect our revenue and results of operations and make our results more difficult to forecast as the ppp forgiveness process has begun and the timing and amount of forgiveness to which our borrowers will be entitled is unpredictable in addition the ppp and other government programs in which we may participate are complex and our participation may lead to governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity and damage to our reputation certain industries where regions has credit exposure including energy restaurants hotels and commercial retail have experienced and in some cases are continuing to experience significant operational challenges as a result of the covid19 pandemic these operational challenges could result in corporate lending clients making higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit which may negatively affect our liquidity the effects of the covid19 pandemic may also cause our commercial customers to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral which we expect would cause significant increases in our credit losses the pandemic may alter consumer behavior including short and longterm spending patterns accordingly certain of these industries may continue to be negatively impacted even after the pandemic has subsided other negative effects of the pandemic that may impact our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time but it is likely that such adverse effects will continue until the covid19 pandemic subsides and the us economy fully recovers the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled risk factors in this annual report on form 10k and any subsequent quarterly report on form 10q until the covid19 pandemic subsides we expect reduced revenues from our lending businesses increased credit losses in our lending portfolios and a decrease in certain sources of fee income additionally draws on lines of credit could increase in the future after the covid19 pandemic subsides it is possible that the us economy experiences a prolonged recession which we expect would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations ineffective liquidity management could adversely affect our financial results and condition effective liquidity management is essential for the operation of our business we require sufficient liquidity to meet customer loan requests customer deposit maturitieswithdrawals payments on our debt obligations as they come due and other cash commitments under both normal operating conditions and unpredictable circumstances causing industry or general financial market stress our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities on terms that are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy generally factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a downturn in the geographic markets in which our loans and operations are concentrated difficult credit markets or unforeseen outflows of cash or collateral including as a result of higher than usual draws on credit lines in response to the covid19 pandemic our access to deposits may also be affected by the liquidity needs of our depositors in particular a majority of our liabilities during were checking accounts and other liquid deposits which are payable on demand or upon several days notice while by comparison a substantial majority of our assets were loans which cannot be called or sold in the same time frame although we have historically been able to replace maturing deposits and advances as necessary we might not be able to replace such funds in the future especially if a large number of our depositors seek to withdraw their accounts regardless of the reason a failure to maintain adequate liquidity could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition our operations are concentrated in the southeastern us and adverse changes in the economic conditions in this region can adversely affect our financial results and condition our operations are concentrated in the southeastern us particularly in the states of alabama florida georgia louisiana mississippi tennessee and texas as a result local economic conditions in the southeastern us significantly affect the demand for the loans and other products we offer to our customers including real estate commercial and construction loans the ability of borrowers to repay these loans and the value of the collateral securing these loans although real estate values in many geographies have improved since the financial crisis future declines including any due to the current economic downturn as a result of the covid19 pandemic may adversely affect borrowers and the value of the collateral securing many of our loans which could adversely affect our currently performing loans leading to future delinquencies or defaults and increases in our provision for credit losses further or continued adverse changes in these economic conditions could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition weatherrelated events and other natural disasters including those caused or exacerbated by climate change as well as manmade disasters could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on financial results and condition higher focus on climate change can also bring transition risks which can negatively impact some sectors and borrowers in our loan portfolio a significant portion of our operations is located in the areas bordering the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean regions that are susceptible to hurricanes or in areas of the southeastern us that are susceptible to tornadoes and other severe weather events in particular in recent years a number of severe hurricanes impacted areas in our footprint many areas in the southeastern us have also experienced severe droughts and floods in recent years any of these or any other severe weather event could cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall business results of operations or financial condition we have taken certain preemptive measures that we believe will mitigate these adverse effects such as maintaining insurance that includes coverage for resultant losses and expenses however such measures cannot prevent the disruption that a catastrophic earthquake fire hurricane tornado or other severe weather event could cause to the markets that we serve and any resulting adverse impact on our customers such as hindering our borrowers ability to timely repay their loans and diminishing the value of any collateral held by us the severity and impact of future earthquakes fires hurricanes tornadoes droughts floods and other weatherrelated events are difficult to predict and may be exacerbated by global climate change manmade disasters and other events connected with the gulf of mexico or atlantic ocean such as oil spills could have similar effects climate change may worsen the frequency and severity of future earthquakes fires hurricanes tornadoes droughts floods and other extreme weatherrelated events that could cause disruption to our business and operations chronic results of climate change such as shifting weather patterns could also cause disruption to our business and operations climate change may also result in new andor more stringent regulatory requirements for the company which could materially affect the companys results of operations by requiring the company to take costly measures to comply with any new laws or regulations related to climate change that may be forthcoming new regulations shift in customer behaviors or breakthrough technologies that accelerate the transition to a lower carbon economy may negatively affect certain sectors and borrowers in our loan portfolio impacting their ability to timely repay their loans or decreasing the value of any collateral held by us we are subject to environmental social and governance risks that could adversely affect our reputation and the trading price of our common stock we are subject to a variety of risks that arise out of the set of concerns that together comprise what have become commonly known as esg matters risks arising from esgrelated policies and practices may adversely affect among other things our reputation and the trading price of our common stock as a large financial institution with a diverse base of customers vendors and suppliers we may face potential negative publicity based on the identity of those we choose to do business with and the publics or certain segments of the publics view of those entities this negative publicity may be driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media and may also be spread through the use of social media platforms if regions relationships with its customers vendors and suppliers were to become the subject of such negative publicity our ability to attract and retain customers and employees may be negatively impacted and the trading price of our common stock may also be impacted additionally investors are considering how corporations are incorporating esg considerations into their business strategy when making investment decisions for example investors are more widely beginning to incorporate the business risks of climate change and the adequacy of companies responses to climate change and other esg matters as part of their investment theses these shifts in investing priorities may result in adverse effects on the trading price of our common stock if investors determine that regions has not made sufficient progress on esg matters if we experience greater credit losses in our loan portfolios than anticipated our earnings may be materially adversely affected as a lender we are exposed to the risk that our customers will be unable to repay their loans and leases according to their terms and that any collateral securing the payment of their loans and leases may not be sufficient to assure repayment credit losses are inherent in the business of making loans and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results we make various assumptions and judgments about the collectability of our loan portfolio and provide an allowance for credit losses based on a number of factors our management periodically determines the allowance for credit losses based on available information including the quality of the loan portfolio the value of the underlying collateral and the level of nonaccrual loans taking into account relevant information about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts of future economic conditions that affect the collectability of our loan portfolio increases in the allowance will result in an expense for the period thereby reducing our reported net income if as a result of general economic conditions there is a decrease in asset quality or growth in the loan portfolio and management determines that additional increases in the allowance for credit losses are necessary we may incur additional expenses which will reduce our net income and our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected although our management will establish an allowance for credit losses it believes is appropriate to absorb expected credit losses over the life of loans in our loan portfolio this allowance may not be adequate for example if a hurricane or other natural disaster were to occur in one of our principal markets or if economic conditions in those markets were to deteriorate unexpectedly additional credit losses not incorporated in the existing allowance for credit losses may occur losses in excess of the existing allowance for credit losses will reduce our net income and could adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition perhaps materially in addition bank regulatory agencies will periodically review our allowance for credit losses and the value attributed to nonaccrual loans and to real estate acquired through foreclosure such regulatory agencies may require us to adjust our determination of the value for these items these adjustments could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition as discussed in greater detail below cecl became effective january and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets the accounting standard removes the existing probable threshold in gaap for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for disclosure on the impact to the allowance at adoption weakness in the residential real estate markets could adversely affect our performance as of december consumer residential real estate loans represented approximately of our total loan portfolio declines in home values would adversely affect the value of collateral securing the residential real estate that we hold as well as the volume of loan originations and the amount we realize on the sale of real estate loans these factors could result in higher delinquencies and greater chargeoffs in future periods which could materially adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations weakness in the commercial real estate markets could adversely affect our performance as of december approximately of our loan portfolio consisted of investor real estate loans the properties securing incomeproducing investor real estate loans are typically not fully leased at the origination of the loan the borrowers ability to repay the loan is instead dependent upon additional leasing through the life of the loan or the borrowers successful operation of a business weak economic conditions including those caused by the covid19 pandemic as well as lockdowns or required business closings related to the covid19 pandemic may impair a borrowers business operations and typically slow the execution of new leases such economic conditions may also lead to existing lease turnover as a result of these factors vacancy rates for retail office and industrial space may increase and hotel occupancy rates may decline high vacancy and lower occupancy rates could also result in rents falling the combination of these factors could result in deterioration in the fundamentals underlying the commercial real estate market and the deterioration in value of some of our loans any such deterioration could adversely affect the ability of our borrowers to repay the amounts due under their loans as a result our business results of operations or financial condition may be materially adversely affected risks associated with home equity products where we are in a second lien position could materially adversely affect our performance home equity products particularly those where we are in a second lien position and particularly those in certain geographic areas may carry a higher risk of noncollection than other loans home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit of our billion home equity portfolio at december approximately billion were home equity lines of credit and billion were closedend home equity loans primarily originated as amortizing loans this type of lending which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrowers residence allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home real estate market values at the time of origination directly affect the amount of credit extended and in addition past and future changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses second lien position lending carries higher credit risk because any decrease in real estate pricing may result in the value of the collateral being insufficient to cover the second lien after the first lien position has been satisfied as of december approximately billion of our home equity lines and loans were in a second lien position weakness in commodity businesses could adversely affect our performance many of our borrowers operate in industries that are directly or indirectly impacted by changes in commodity prices this includes agriculture livestock metals timber textiles and energy businesses including oil gas and petrochemical as well as businesses indirectly impacted by commodities prices such as businesses that transport commodities or manufacture equipment used in production of commodities changes in commodity products prices depend on local regional and global events or conditions that affect supply and demand for the relevant commodity these industries have been and may in the future be subject to significant volatility for example oil prices have been volatile in recent years including in and commodity prices have generally declined as a result of reduced demand driven by the covid19 pandemic as a consequence of oil and gas price volatility our energyrelated portfolio may be subject to additional pressure on credit quality metrics including past due criticized and nonperforming loans as well as net chargeoffs in addition legislative changes such as the elimination of certain tax incentives could have significant impacts on this portfolio industry competition may adversely affect our degree of success our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully we operate in a highly competitive industry that could become even more competitive as a result of legislative regulatory and technological changes as well as continued industry consolidation this consolidation may produce larger bettercapitalized and more geographically diverse companies that are capable of offering a wider array of financial products and services at more competitive prices for example there have been a number of recently completed or announced significant mergers of financial institutions within our market areas and there may in the future be additional consolidation these mergers will if completed allow the merged financial institutions to benefit from cost savings and shared resources in our market areas we face competition from other commercial banks savings and loan associations credit unions internet banks fintechs finance companies mutual funds insurance companies brokerage and investment banking firms mortgage companies and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services some of our nonbank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations we are and therefore may have greater flexibility in competing for business in addition technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services such as loans and payment services that traditionally were banking products and made it possible for technology companies to compete with financial institutions in providing electronic internetbased and mobile phonebased financial solutions competition with nonbanks including technology companies to provide financial products and services is intensifying in particular the activity of fintechs has grown significantly over recent years and is expected to continue to grow fintechs have and may continue to offer bank or banklike products for example a number of fintechs have applied for and in some cases been granted bank or industrial loan charters in addition other fintechs have partnered with existing banks to allow them to offer deposit products to their customers regulatory changes such as the revisions to the fdics rules on brokered deposits intended to reflect recent technological changes and innovations may also make it easier for fintechs to partner with banks and offer deposit products in addition to fintechs traditional technology companies have begun to make efforts toward providing financial services directly to their customers and are expected to continue to explore new ways to do so many of these companies including our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and some have lower cost structures in part due to lack of physical locations although providing digital products and services has been important to serving customers and competing in the financial services industry for some time the covid19 pandemic has further accelerated the move toward digital banking and financial services and we expect a banks digital offerings to be a key competitive differentiator beyond the covid19 pandemic the move toward digital banking and financial services and customer expectations regarding digital offerings will require us to invest greater resources in technological improvements our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of additional factors including customer convenience quality of service personal contacts the quality of the technology that supports the customer experience pricing and range of products if we are unable to successfully compete for new customers and to retain our current customers our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected perhaps materially in particular if we experience an outflow of deposits as a result of our customers seeking investments with higher yields or greater financial stability we may be forced to rely more heavily on borrowings and other sources of funding to operate our business and meet withdrawal demands thereby adversely affecting our net interest margin and financial performance in addition we may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers as a result our ability to effectively compete to retain or acquire new business may be impaired and our business financial condition or results of operations may be adversely affected fluctuations in market interest rates may adversely affect our performance our profitability depends to a large extent on our net interest income which is the difference between the interest income received on interestearning assets primarily loans and investment securities and the interest expense incurred in connection with interestbearing liabilities primarily deposits and borrowings net interest income also includes rental income and depreciation expense associated with operating leases for which regions is the lessor the level of net interest income is primarily a function of the average balance of interestearning assets the average balance of interestbearing liabilities and the spread between the yield on such assets and the cost of such liabilities these factors are influenced by both the pricing and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities which in turn are impacted by external factors such as the local economy competition for loans and deposits the monetary policy of the fomc and interest rates markets the cost of our deposits and shortterm wholesale borrowings is largely based on shortterm interest rates the level of which is influenced heavily by the fomcs actions however the yields generated by our loans and securities are typically driven by both shortterm and longerterm interest rates longerterm rates are affected by multiple factors including the actions of the fomc through actions such as quantitative easing or tightening and the markets expectations for future inflation growth and other economic considerations the level of net interest income is therefore influenced by the overall level of interest rates along with the shape of the yield curve interest rate volatility can reduce unrealized gains or create unrealized losses in our portfolios if the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities increase at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestearning assets our net interest income may decline our net interest income would be similarly affected if the interest rates on our interestearning assets declined at a faster pace than the interest rates on our interestbearing liabilities the significant reductions to the federal funds rate have led to a decrease in the rates and yields on us treasury securities if interest rates decline further we would expect net interest income to decline however the companys interest rate hedging program will protect against any reductions to short term interest rates conversely an increasing rate environment would likely have a positive impact on twelvemonth net interest income however increasing rates would also increase debt service requirements for some of our borrowers and may adversely affect those borrowers ability to pay as contractually obligated and could result in additional delinquencies or chargeoffs our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected as a result the overall effect of lower interest rates cannot be predicted at this time and depends on future actions the federal reserve may take including in response to the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions for a more detailed discussion of these risks and our management strategies for these risks see the net interest income margin and interest rate risk net interest income and margin market riskinterest rate risk and securities sections of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k changes in the method pursuant to which the libor and other benchmark rates are determined could adversely impact our business and results of operations our floatingrate funding certain hedging transactions and certain of the products that we offer such as floatingrate loans and mortgages determine their applicable interest rate or payment amount by reference to a benchmark rate such as libor or to an index currency basket or other financial metric libor and certain other benchmark rates are the subject of recent national international and other regulatory guidance and proposals for reform in july the chief executive of the fca announced that the fca intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit rates for the calculation of libor after the administrator of libor has proposed extending publication of the most commonly used us dollar libor settings to june and ceasing publishing other libor settings on december the us federal banking agencies have issued guidance strongly encouraging banking organizations to cease using us dollar libor as a reference rate in new contracts as soon as practicable and in any event by december these actions and announcements indicate that the continuation of libor on the current basis cannot and will not be guaranteed after consequently at this time it is not possible to predict whether and to what extent banks will continue to provide submissions for the calculation of libor similarly it is not possible to predict whether libor will continue to be viewed as an acceptable market benchmark what rate or rates may become accepted alternatives to libor or what the effect of any such changes in views or alternatives may be on the markets for liborlinked financial instruments regulators industry groups and certain committees eg the alternative reference rates committee have among other things published recommended fallback language for liborlinked financial instruments identified recommended alternatives for certain libor rates and proposed implementations of the recommended alternatives in floating rate instruments for example in april the federal reserve bank of new york commenced publication of the sofr which has been recommended as an alternative to us dollar libor by the alternative reference rates committee however uncertainty remains as to the transition process and acceptance of sofr as the primary alternative to libor at this time it is not possible to predict whether these recommendations and proposals will be broadly accepted whether they will continue to evolve and what the effect of their implementation may be on the markets for floatingrate financial instruments certain of our liborbased financial products and contracts including but not limited to hedging products debt obligations preferred stock investments and loans extend beyond proposed libor cessation timelines we are in the process of assessing the impact that a cessation or market replacement of libor would have on these various products and contracts any future reductions in our credit ratings may increase our funding costs and place limitations on business activities the major ratings agencies regularly evaluate us and their ratings are based on a number of factors including our financial strength and conditions affecting the financial services industry generally in general ratings agencies base their ratings on many quantitative and qualitative factors including capital adequacy liquidity asset quality business mix and level and quality of earnings and we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings the ratings assigned to regions and regions bank remain subject to change at any time and it is possible that any ratings agency will take action to downgrade regions regions bank or both in the future additionally ratings agencies may also make substantial changes to their ratings policies and practices which may affect our credit ratings in the future changes to existing ratings guidelines and new ratings guidelines may among other things adversely affect the ratings of our securities or other securities in which we have an economic interest regions credit ratings can have negative consequences that can impact our ability to access the debt and capital markets as well as reduce our profitability through increased costs on future debt issuances if regions were to be downgraded below investment grade we may not be able to reliably access the shortterm unsecured funding markets and certain customers could be prohibited from placing deposits with regions bank which could cause us to hold more cash and liquid investments to meet our ongoing liquidity needs such actions could reduce our profitability as these liquid investments earn a lower return than other assets such as loans regions liquidity policy requires that the holding company maintain the greater of i cash sufficient to cover months of debt service and other cash needs or ii a cash balance of million although this policy helps protect us against the costs of unexpected adverse funding environments we cannot guarantee that this policy will be sufficient additionally if regions were to be downgraded to below investment grade certain counterparty contracts may be required to be renegotiated or require posting of additional collateral refer to note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k for the fair value of contracts subject to contingent credit features and the collateral postings associated with such contracts although the exact amount of additional collateral is unknown it is reasonable to conclude that regions may be required to post additional collateral related to existing contracts with contingent credit features the value of our goodwill and other intangible assets may decline in the future as of december we had billion of goodwill and million of other intangible assets a significant decline in our expected future cash flows a significant adverse change in the business climate slower economic growth or a significant and sustained decline in the price of our common stock any or all of which could be materially impacted by many of the risk factors discussed herein may necessitate our taking charges in the future related to the impairment of our goodwill the covid19 pandemic may impact our assessment of our goodwill future regulatory actions and increases in income tax rates could also have a material impact on assessments of goodwill for impairment if we were to conclude that a future writedown of our goodwill is necessary we would record the appropriate charge which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill consist of core deposit intangibles purchased credit card relationship assets and the dus license adverse events or circumstances could impact the recoverability of these intangible assets including loss of core deposits significant losses of credit card accounts andor balances increased competition and adverse changes in the economy to the extent these intangible assets are deemed unrecoverable a noncash impairment charge would be recorded which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations the value of our deferred tax assets could adversely affect our operating results and regulatory capital ratios as of december regions had approximately million in net deferred tax liabilities which include approximately million of deferred tax assets net of valuation allowance of million our deferred tax assets are subject to an evaluation of whether it is more likely than not that they will be realized for financial statement purposes in making this determination we consider all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies we have determined that the deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized at december except for million related to state deferred tax assets for which we have established a valuation allowance if we were to conclude that a significant portion of our deferred tax assets were not more likely than not to be realized the required valuation allowance could adversely affect our financial position results of operations and regulatory capital ratios in addition the value of our deferred tax assets and liabilities would be affected by a change in statutory tax rates an increase in statutory rates would have an adverse effect on a net deferred tax liability position other tax law changes could have a detrimental impact on the value of deferred tax assets changes in the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us financial services companies are interrelated as a result of trading clearing counterparty or other relationships we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry including brokers and dealers commercial banks investment banks mutual and hedge funds and other institutional clients as a result defaults by or even mere speculation about one or more financial services companies or the financial services industry generally may lead to marketwide liquidity problems and could lead to losses or defaults by us or by other institutions many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client in addition our credit risk may be exacerbated if the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or lease or derivative exposure due us any such losses may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our businesses may be adversely affected if we are unable to hire and retain qualified employees our success depends in part on our executive officers and other key personnel the market for qualified individuals is highly competitive and we may not be able to attract and retain qualified personnel or candidates to replace or succeed members of our senior management team or other key personnel our compensation practices are subject to review and oversight by the federal reserve the fdic and other regulators as a large financial and banking institution we may be subject to limitations on compensation practices which may or may not affect our competitors by the federal reserve the fdic or other regulators these limitations could further affect our ability to attract and retain our executive officers and other key personnel in particular as we are more often competing for personnel with fintechs and other less regulated entities who may not have the same limitations on compensation as we do we are subject to a variety of operational risks including the risk of fraud or theft by employees which may adversely affect our business and results of operations we are exposed to many types of operational risks including business continuity process third party information technology human resource model and fraud risks each of which may be amplified by increased remote work due to the covid19 pandemic regions fraud risks include fraud committed by external parties against the company or its customers and fraud committed internally by our associates certain fraud risks including identity theft and account takeover may increase as a result of customers account or personally identifiable information being obtained through breaches of retailers or other third parties networks we have established processes and procedures intended to identify measure monitor mitigate report and analyze these risks however there are inherent limitations to our risk management strategies as there may exist or develop in the future risks that we have not appropriately anticipated monitored or identified if our risk management framework proves ineffective we could suffer unexpected losses we may have to expend resources detecting and correcting the failure in our systems and we may be subject to potential claims from third parties and government agencies we may also suffer severe reputational damage any of these consequences could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations in particular the unauthorized disclosure misappropriation mishandling or misuse of personal nonpublic confidential or proprietary information of customers could result in significant regulatory consequences reputational damage and financial loss damage to our reputation could significantly harm our businesses our ability to attract and retain customers and highlyskilled management and employees is impacted by our reputation a negative public opinion of us and our business can result from any number of activities including our lending practices corporate governance and regulatory compliance acquisitions and actions taken by community organizations in response to these activities furthermore negative publicity regarding regions as an employer could have an adverse impact on our reputation especially with respect to matters of diversity pay equity and workplace harassment significant harm to our reputation could also arise as a result of regulatory or governmental actions litigation and the activities of our customers other participants in the financial services industry or our contractual counterparties such as our service providers and vendors the potential harm is heightened given increased attention to how corporations address environmental social and governance issues in addition a cybersecurity event affecting regions or our customers data could have a negative impact on our reputation and customer confidence in regions and its cybersecurity practices damage to our reputation could also adversely affect our credit ratings and access to the capital markets additionally whereas negative public opinion once was primarily driven by adverse news coverage in traditional media the widespread use of social media platforms by virtually every segment of society facilitates the rapid dissemination of information or misinformation which magnifies the potential harm to our reputation we are subject to a variety of systems failure and cybersecurity risks that could adversely affect our business and financial performance failure in or breach of our systems or infrastructure or those of our thirdparty service providers or providers to such thirdparty service providers including as a result of cyberattacks could disrupt our businesses or the businesses of our customers this could result in the disclosure or misuse of confidential or proprietary information damage our reputation increase our costs and cause financial losses as a large financial institution we depend on our ability to process record and monitor a large number of customer transactions on a continuous basis as public and regulatory expectations as well as our customers expectations have increased regarding operational performance and information security our systems and infrastructure must continue to be safeguarded and monitored for potential failures disruptions and breakdowns our business financial accounting and data processing systems or other operating systems and facilities may stop operating properly or become disabled or damaged as a result of a number of factors including events that are wholly or partially beyond our control for example there could be electrical or telecommunications outages natural disasters such as earthquakes tornadoes and hurricanes pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic events arising from local or larger scale political or social matters including terrorist acts and civil unrest and as described below cyberattacks although we have business continuity plans and other safeguards in place our business operations may be adversely affected by significant and widespread disruption to our physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers for a discussion of the guidance that federal banking regulators have released regarding cybersecurity and cyber risk management standards see the supervision and regulationfinancial privacy and cybersecurity section of item business of this annual report on form 10k information security risks for large financial institutions such as regions have increased significantly in recent years in part because of the proliferation of internet and mobile banking and the increased sophistication and activities of organized crime hackers terrorists nationstates activists and other external parties this increase is expected to continue and further intensify third parties with whom we or our customers do business also present operational and information security risks to us including security breaches or failures of their own systems as noted above our operations rely on the secure processing transmission and storage of confidential information in our computer systems and networks in addition to access our products and services our customers may use personal computers smartphones tablets and other mobile devices that are beyond our control environment although we believe that we have appropriate information security procedures and controls designed to prevent or limit the effects of a cyberattack or information security breach our technologies systems networks and our customers devices may be the target of cyberattacks or information security breaches that could result in the unauthorized release gathering monitoring misuse loss or destruction of regions or our customers confidential proprietary and other information we also have insurance coverage that may subject to policy terms and conditions cover certain losses associated with cyberattacks or information security breaches but it may be insufficient to cover all losses from any such attack or breach including any related damage to our reputation additionally cyberattacks such as denial of service ransomware or malware attacks hacking or terrorist activities could disrupt regions or our customers or other third parties business operations for example denial of service attacks have been launched against a number of large financial services institutions including regions although these past events have not resulted in a breach of regions client data or account information such attacks have adversely affected the performance of regions banks website wwwregionscom and in some instances prevented customers from accessing regions banks secure websites for consumer and commercial applications in all cases the attacks primarily resulted in inconvenience however future cyberattacks could be more disruptive and damaging and regions may not be able to anticipate or prevent all such attacks workfromhome arrangements such as those implemented in response to the covid19 pandemic may also present additional cybersecurity information security and operational risks during the covid19 pandemic we have experienced an increase in cybersecurity events such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic our layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events to date our information security risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the covid19 pandemic subsides as cyber threats continue to evolve we may be required to expend significant additional resources to continue to modify or enhance our layers of defense or to investigate and remediate any information security vulnerabilities we may also be required to incur significant costs in connection with any regulatory investigation or civil litigation resulting from a cyberattack or information security breach that impacts us in addition our thirdparty service providers may be unable to identify vulnerabilities in their systems or once identified be unable to promptly provide required patches further even if provided such patches may not fully remediate any vulnerability or may be difficult for regions to implement the techniques used by cyber criminals change frequently may not be recognized until launched and can be initiated from a variety of sources including terrorist organizations and hostile foreign governments these criminals may attempt to fraudulently induce employees customers or other users of our systems to disclose sensitive information in order to gain access to data or our systems disruptions or failures in the physical infrastructure or operating systems that support our businesses and customers or cyberattacks or security breaches of the networks systems or devices that our customers use to access our products and services could result in customer attrition regulatory fines civil litigation penalties or intervention reputational damage reimbursement or other compensation costs remediation costs additional cybersecurity protection costs increased insurance premiums andor additional compliance costs any of which could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition we could also be adversely affected if we lost access to information or services from a thirdparty service provider as a result of a security breach system or operational failure or disruption affecting the thirdparty service provider for a more detailed discussion of these risks and specific occurrences see the information security risk section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k we are also subject to laws and regulations relating to the privacy of the information of clients employees or others and any failure to comply with these laws and regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage as new privacyrelated laws and regulations such as the gdpr california consumer privacy act california privacy rights act and any future laws and regulations which will be modeled after those laws are implemented the time and resources needed for us to comply with such laws and regulations as well as our potential liability for noncompliance and reporting obligations in the case of data breaches may significantly increase in addition our businesses are increasingly subject to laws and regulations relating to privacy surveillance encryption and data use in the jurisdictions in which we operate compliance with these laws and regulations may require us to change our policies procedures and technology for information security and segregation of data which could among other things make us more vulnerable to operational failures and to monetary penalties for breach of such laws and regulations we rely on other companies to provide key components of our business infrastructure third parties provide key components of our business operations such as data processing recording and monitoring transactions online banking interfaces and services internet connections and network access while we have selected these thirdparty vendors carefully performing upfront due diligence and ongoing monitoring activities we do not control their actions any problems caused by these third parties including those resulting from disruptions in services provided by a vendor including as a result of a cyberattack other information security event or a natural disaster financial or operational difficulties for the vendor issues at thirdparty vendors to the vendors failure of a vendor to handle current or higher volumes failure of a vendor to provide services for any reason poor performance of services failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations or fraud or misconduct on the part of employees of any of our vendors could adversely affect our ability to deliver products and services to our customers our reputation and our ability to conduct our business in certain situations replacing these thirdparty vendors could also create significant delay and expense accordingly use of such third parties creates an unavoidable inherent risk to our business operations such risk is generally expected to remain elevated until the covid19 pandemic subsides as many of our vendors have also been and may further be affected by stayathome or similar orders market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services we depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about clients and counterparties in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions with clients and counterparties we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of clients and counterparties including financial statements and other financial information we also may rely on representations of clients and counterparties as to the accuracy and completeness of that information and with respect to financial statements on reports of independent auditors if made available if this information is inaccurate we may be subject to regulatory action reputational harm or other adverse effects with respect to the operation of our business our financial condition and our results of operations we are exposed to risk of environmental liability when we take title to property in the course of our business we may foreclose on and take title to real estate as a result we could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties we may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage personal injury investigation and cleanup costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination or may be required to investigate or clean up hazardous or toxic substances or chemical releases at a property the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial in addition if we are the owner or former owner of a contaminated site we may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property if we become subject to significant environmental liabilities our business financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected we rely on the mortgage secondary market for some of our liquidity in we sold of the mortgage loans we originated to the agencies we rely on the agencies to purchase loans that meet their conforming loan requirements in order to reduce our credit risk and provide funding for additional loans we desire to originate we cannot provide assurance that the agencies will not materially limit their purchases of conforming loans due to capital constraints a change in the criteria for conforming loans or other factors additionally various proposals have been made to reform the us residential mortgage finance market including the role of the agencies the exact effects of any such reforms if implemented are not yet known but they may limit our ability to sell conforming loans to the agencies if we are unable to continue to sell conforming loans to the agencies our ability to fund and thus originate additional mortgage loans may be adversely affected which would adversely affect our results of operations we are subject to a variety of risks in connection with any sale of loans we may conduct in connection with our sale of one or more loan portfolios we may make certain representations and warranties to the purchaser concerning the loans sold and the procedures under which those loans have been originated and serviced if any of these representations and warranties are incorrect we may be required to indemnify the purchaser for any related losses or we may be required to repurchase part or all of the affected loans we may also be required to repurchase loans as a result of borrower fraud or in the event of early payment default by the borrower on a loan we have sold if we are required to make any indemnity payments or repurchases and do not have a remedy available to us against a solvent counterparty we may not be able to recover our losses resulting from these indemnity payments and repurchases consequently our results of operations may be adversely affected in addition we must report as held for sale any loans that we have undertaken to sell whether or not a purchase agreement for the loans has been executed we may therefore be unable to ultimately complete a sale for part or all of the loans we classify as held for sale management must exercise its judgment in determining when loans must be reclassified from held for investment status to held for sale status under applicable accounting guidelines any failure to accurately report loans as held for sale could result in regulatory investigations and monetary penalties any of these actions could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations reclassifying loans from held for investment to held for sale also requires that the affected loans be marked to the lower of cost or fair value as a result any loans classified as held for sale may be adversely affected by changes in interest rates and by changes in the borrowers creditworthiness we may be required to reduce the value of any loans we mark held for sale which could adversely affect our results of operations our reported financial results depend on managements selection of accounting methods and certain assumptions and estimates our accounting policies and assumptions are fundamental to our reported financial condition and results of operations our management must exercise judgment in selecting and applying many of these accounting policies and methods so they comply with gaap and reflect managements judgment of the most appropriate manner to report our financial condition and results in some cases management must select the accounting policy or method to apply from two or more alternatives any of which may be reasonable under the circumstances yet may result in us reporting materially different results than would have been reported under a different alternative certain accounting policies are critical to presenting our reported financial condition and results of operations they require management to make difficult subjective or complex judgments about matters that are uncertain materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions or estimates the companys critical accounting estimates include the allowance for credit losses fair value measurements intangible assets residential msrs and income taxes because of the uncertainty of estimates involved in these matters we may be required to do one or more of the following significantly increase the allowance for credit losses andor sustain credit losses that are significantly higher than the allowance provided recognize significant losses on assets carried at fair value recognize significant impairment on our goodwill other intangible assets or deferred tax asset balances significantly increase our accrued income taxes or significantly decrease the value of our residential msrs any of these actions could adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations if the models that we use in our business perform poorly or provide inadequate information our business or results of operations may be adversely affected we utilize quantitative models to assist in measuring risks and estimating or predicting certain financial values models may be used in processes such as determining the pricing of various products grading loans and extending credit measuring interest rate and other market risks forecasting financial performance predicting losses improving customer services maintaining adherence to laws and regulations assessing capital adequacy and calculating regulatory capital levels as well as to estimate the value of financial instruments and balance sheet items poorly designed implemented or managed models present the risk that our business decisions that consider information based on such models will be adversely affected due to the inadequacy or inaccuracy of that information which may damage our reputation and adversely affect our reported financial condition and results of operations also information we provide to the public or to our regulators based on poorly designed implemented or managed models could be inaccurate or misleading some of the decisions that our regulators make including those related to capital distributions to our shareholders could be affected adversely due to the perception that the quality of the models used to generate the relevant information is insufficient changes in our accounting policies or in accounting standards could materially affect how we report our financial results and condition from time to time the fasb and sec change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements these changes can be difficult to predict and can materially impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations for example fasbs cecl accounting standard became effective on january and substantially changed the accounting for credit losses on loans and other financial assets held by banks financial institutions and other organizations the standard removes the existing probable threshold in gaap for recognizing credit losses and instead requires companies to reflect their estimate of credit losses over the life of the financial assets companies must consider all relevant information when estimating expected credit losses including details about past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts the standard had a material impact to the allowance and capital at adoption see regions impact at adoption in note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k in march the federal banking agencies released an interim final rule subsequently adopted as a final rule in august which allows an addback to regulatory capital for the impacts of cecl for a twoyear period and at the end of the two years the impact is then phased in over the following three years under the rule during and the adjustment to cet1 capital reflects the change in retained earnings upon initial adoption of cecl on january plus of the increase in the allowance for credit losses since january then beginning january the impact is phased in over the following three years regions has elected to apply this phasein cecl may also impact regions ongoing earnings perhaps materially due in part to changes in loan portfolio composition changes in credit metrics and changes in the macroeconomic forecast regions ability to accurately forecast the future economic environment could result in volatility in the provision as a result of the new accounting standard risks arising from the legal and regulatory framework in which our business operates we are and may in the future be subject to litigation investigations and governmental proceedings that may result in liabilities adversely affecting our financial condition business or results of operations or in reputational harm we and our subsidiaries are and may in the future be named as defendants in various class actions and other litigation and may be the subject of subpoenas reviews requests for information investigations and formal and informal proceedings by government and selfregulatory agencies regarding our and their businesses and activities including subpoenas requests for information and investigations related to the activities of our customers any such matters may result in material adverse consequences to our results of operations financial condition or ability to conduct our business including adverse judgments settlements fines penalties including civil money penalties under applicable banking laws injunctions restrictions on our business activities or other relief our involvement in any such matters even if the matters are ultimately determined in our favor could also cause significant harm to our reputation and divert management attention from the operation of our business further any settlement consent order or adverse judgment in connection with any formal or informal proceeding or investigation by government or selfregulatory agencies may result in additional litigation investigations or proceedings as other litigants and government or selfregulatory agencies including the inquiries mentioned above begin independent reviews of the same businesses or activities in general the amounts paid by financial institutions in settlement of proceedings or investigations including those relating to antimoney laundering matters or sales practices have increased substantially and are likely to remain elevated in some cases governmental authorities have required criminal pleas or other extraordinary terms as part of such settlements which could have significant collateral consequences for a financial institution including loss of customers restrictions on the ability to access the capital markets and the inability to operate certain businesses or offer certain products for a period of time in addition enforcement matters could impact our supervisory and cra ratings which may in turn restrict or limit our activities additional information relating to our litigation investigations and other proceedings is discussed in note commitments contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements of this annual report on form 10k we are subject to extensive governmental regulation which could have an adverse impact on our operations we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation supervision and examination governing almost all aspects of our operations which limits the businesses in which we may permissibly engage the laws and regulations governing our business are intended primarily for the protection of our depositors our customers the financial system and the fdic insurance fund not our shareholders or other creditors these laws and regulations govern a variety of matters including certain debt obligations changes in control maintenance of adequate capital and general business operations and financial condition including permissible types amounts and terms of loans and investments the amount of reserves against deposits restrictions on dividends and repurchases of our capital securities establishment of branch offices and the maximum interest rate that may be charged by law further we must obtain approval from our regulators before engaging in many activities and our regulators have the ability to compel us to or restrict us from taking certain actions entirely there can be no assurance that any regulatory approvals we may require or otherwise seek will be obtained regulations affecting banks and other financial institutions are undergoing continuous review and frequently change and the ultimate effect of such changes cannot be predicted changes to the legal and regulatory framework governing our operations including the doddfrank act and egrrcpa have significantly revised the laws and regulations under which we operate regulations and laws may be modified or repealed at any time and new legislation may be enacted that will affect us regions bank and our subsidiaries including any changes resulting from the recent change in us presidential administration and change in control of the us senate any changes in any federal and state law as well as regulations and governmental policies income tax laws and accounting principles could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways including ways that may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations failure to appropriately comply with any such laws regulations or principles could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties or damage to our reputation all of which could adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations our regulatory capital position is discussed in greater detail in note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form 10k we may be subject to more stringent capital and liquidity requirements regions and regions bank are each subject to capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements specifying minimum amounts and types of capital that must be maintained from time to time the regulators implement changes to these regulatory capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines if we fail to meet these minimum capital adequacy and liquidity guidelines and other regulatory requirements we or our subsidiaries may be restricted in the types of activities we may conduct and may be prohibited from taking certain capital actions such as paying dividends and repurchasing or redeeming capital securities regions and regions bank are each required to comply with applicable capital adequacy standards established by the federal reserve which are based on the basel iii framework the basel committee has published standards that it describes as the finalization of the basel iii postcrisis regulatory reforms these standards will generally be effective on january with an aggregate output floor phasing in through january among other things these standards revise the standardized approach for credit risk and provide a new standardized approach for operational risk capital the impact of these standards on us will depend on the manner in which the revisions are implemented in the us with respect to firms such as regions and regions bank for more information concerning our compliance with capital and liquidity requirements see note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions in the notes to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form 10k rulemaking changes implemented by the cfpb will result in higher regulatory and compliance costs that may adversely affect our results of operations since its formation the cfpb has finalized a number of significant rules that could have a significant impact on our business and the financial services industry more generally we may also be required to add additional compliance personnel or incur other significant compliancerelated expenses our business results of operations or competitive position may be adversely affected as a result we may not be able to complete future acquisitions may not be successful in realizing the benefits of any future acquisitions that are completed or may choose not to pursue acquisition opportunities we might find beneficial we may from time to time evaluate and engage in the acquisition or divestiture of businesses including their assets or liabilities such as loans or deposits we must generally satisfy a number of meaningful conditions prior to completing any such transaction including in certain cases federal and state bank regulatory approvals the process for obtaining required regulatory approvals particularly for large financial institutions like regions can be difficult timeconsuming and unpredictable we may fail to pursue evaluate or complete strategic and competitively significant business opportunities as a result of our inability or our perceived inability to obtain required regulatory approvals in a timely manner or at all assuming we are able to successfully complete one or more transactions we may not be able to successfully integrate and realize the expected synergies from any completed transaction in a timely manner or at all in particular we may be held responsible by federal and state regulators for regulatory and compliance failures at an acquired business prior to the date of the acquisition and these failures by the acquired company may have negative consequences for us including the imposition of formal or informal enforcement actions completion and integration of any transaction may also divert management attention from other matters result in additional costs and expenses or adversely affect our relationships with our customers and employees any of which may adversely affect our business or results of operations future acquisitions may also result in dilution of our current shareholders ownership interests or may require we incur additional indebtedness or use a substantial amount of our available cash and other liquid assets as a result our financial condition may be affected and we may become more susceptible to economic conditions and competitive pressures increases in fdic insurance assessments may adversely affect our earnings our deposits are insured by the fdic up to legal limits and accordingly we are subject to fdic deposit insurance assessments we generally cannot control the amount of assessments we will be required to pay for fdic insurance the fdic may require us to pay higher fdic assessments than we currently do or may charge additional special assessments or future prepayments if for example there are financial institution failures in the future any increase in deposit assessments or special assessments may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations see the supervision and regulationdeposit insurance discussion within item business and the noninterest expense discussion within item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k for additional information related to the fdics deposit insurance assessments applicable to regions bank unfavorable results from ongoing stress analyses may adversely affect our ability to retain customers or compete for new business opportunities the federal reserve conducts supervisory stress testing of regions to evaluate our ability to absorb losses in baseline and severely adverse economic and stressed financial scenarios generated by the federal reserve the federal reserve also has implemented the scb framework which created a firmspecific risk sensitive buffer that is informed by the results of supervisory stress testing and is applied to regulatory minimum capital levels to help determine effective minimum ratio requirements firm specific scb requirements as well as a summary of the results of certain aspects of the federal reserves supervisory stress testing and firm specific results are released publicly although the theoretical stress tests are not meant to assess our current condition or outlook our customers may misinterpret and negatively react to the results of these stress tests despite the strength of our financial condition any potential misinterpretations and adverse reactions could limit our ability to attract and retain customers or to effectively compete for new business opportunities the inability to attract and retain customers or effectively compete for new business may have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations our regulators may also require us to raise additional capital or take other actions or may impose restrictions on capital distributions based on the results of the supervisory stress tests such as requiring revisions or resubmission of our annual capital plan which could adversely affect our ability to pay dividends and repurchase capital securities in addition we may not be able to raise additional capital if required to do so or may not be able to do so on terms that we believe are advantageous to regions or its current shareholders any such capital raises if required may also be dilutive to our existing shareholders further as discussed in the supervision and regulation section of item of this annual report on form 10k the federal reserve in august announced that regions initial scb would be percent this is higher than the scb assigned to some peer banks and therefore could limit our future ability to make capital distributions relative to those peer banks should our capital ratios decline if an orderly liquidation of a systemically important bhc or nonbank financial company were triggered we could face assessments for the orderly liquidation fund the doddfrank act created a new mechanism the ola for liquidation of systemically important bhcs and nonbank financial companies the ola is administered by the fdic and is based on the fdics bank resolution model the secretary of the us treasury may trigger a liquidation under this authority only after consultation with the president of the us and after receiving a recommendation from the boards of the fdic and the federal reserve upon a twothirds vote liquidation proceedings will be funded by the orderly liquidation fund which will borrow from the us treasury and impose riskbased assessments on covered financial companies riskbased assessments would be made first on entities that received more in the resolution than they would have received in the liquidation to the extent of such excess and second if necessary on among others bhcs with total consolidated assets of billion or more such as regions any such assessments may adversely affect our business financial condition or results of operations we are a holding company and depend on our subsidiaries for dividends distributions and other payments we are a legal entity separate and distinct from our banking and other subsidiaries our principal source of cash flow including cash flow to pay dividends to our shareholders and principal and interest on our outstanding debt is dividends from regions bank there are statutory and regulatory limitations on the payment of dividends by regions bank to us as well as by us to our shareholders regulations of both the federal reserve and the state of alabama affect the ability of regions bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us if regions bank is unable to make dividend payments to us and sufficient cash or liquidity is not otherwise available we may not be able to make dividend payments to our common and preferred shareholders or principal and interest payments on our outstanding debt see the shareholders equity section of item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations of this annual report on form 10k in addition our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of creditors of that subsidiary except to the extent that any of our claims as a creditor of such subsidiary may be recognized as a result shares of our capital stock are effectively subordinated to all existing and future liabilities and obligations of our subsidiaries at december our subsidiaries total deposits and borrowings were approximately billion we may not pay dividends on shares of our capital stock holders of shares of our capital stock are only entitled to receive such dividends as our board may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock furthermore the terms of our outstanding preferred stock prohibit us from declaring or paying any dividends on any junior series of our capital stock including our common stock or from repurchasing redeeming or acquiring such junior stock unless we have declared and paid full dividends on our outstanding preferred stock for the most recently completed dividend period we are also subject to statutory and regulatory limitations on our ability to pay dividends on our capital stock for example it is the policy of the federal reserve that bhcs should generally pay dividends on common stock only out of earnings and only if prospective earnings retention is consistent with the organizations expected future needs asset quality and financial condition additionally regions is subject to the federal reserves scb requirement whereby supervisory stress testing informs a buffer above regulatory minimum capital levels that must be maintained to avoid restrictions on capital distributions further as discussed in the supervision and regulation section of item of this annual report on form 10k the federal reserve has extended with modest adjustment the distribution restrictions previously implemented through the first quarter of in response to the ongoing covid19 pandemic at this time it is unknown if these distribution restrictions will be extended beyond the first quarter lastly if we are unable to satisfy the capital requirements applicable to us for any reason we may be limited in our ability to declare and pay dividends on our capital stock antitakeover and banking laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our boards approval under federal law subject to certain exemptions a person entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of a bhc acquisition of or more of any class of voting stock of a bhc or state member bank including shares of our common stock creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquirer controls the bhc or state member bank also as noted under the supervision and regulation section of item of this annual report on form 10k a bhc must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before among other things acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than percent of the voting shares of any bank including regions bank one factor the federal banking agencies must consider in certain acquisitions is the systemic impact of the transaction this may make it more difficult for large institutions to acquire other large institutions and may otherwise delay the regulatory approval process possibly by requiring public hearings similarly under alabama state law a person or group of persons must receive approval from the superintendent of banks before acquiring control of an alabama bank or any entity having control of an alabama bank for the purposes of determining whether approval is required control is defined as the power directly or indirectly to vote the lesser of i or more of any class of voting securities of an alabama bank or any entity having control of an alabama bank or ii or more of any class of voting securities of an alabama bank or any entity having control of an alabama bank if no other person will own control or hold the power to vote a majority of that class of voting securities following the acquisition of such voting securities furthermore there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt for example holders of our preferred stock have certain voting rights that could adversely affect share value if and when dividends on the preferred stock have not been declared and paid for at least six quarterly dividend periods or their equivalent whether or not consecutive the authorized number of directors then constituting our board will automatically be increased by two and the preferred shareholders will be entitled to elect the two additional directors also the affirmative vote or consent of the holders of at least twothirds of all of the thenoutstanding shares of the preferred stock is required to consummate a binding shareexchange or reclassification involving the preferred stock or a merger or consolidation of regions with or into another entity unless certain requirements are met these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation including the rights of the holders of our preferred stock could result in regions being less attractive to a potential acquirer and thus adversely affect our share value risks related to our capital or debt the market price of shares of our capital stock will fluctuate the market price of our capital stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects the market price of our capital stock including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock may be subject to fluctuations unrelated to our operating performance or prospects our capital stock is subordinate to our existing and future indebtedness our capital stock including our common stock and depositary shares representing fractional interests in our preferred stock ranks junior to all of regions existing and future indebtedness and regions other nonequity claims with respect to assets available to satisfy claims against us including claims in the event of our liquidation as of december regions total liabilities were approximately billion and we may incur additional indebtedness in the future to increase our capital resources additionally if our total capital ratio or the total capital ratio of regions bank falls below the required minimums we or regions bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of debt securities including mediumterm notes senior or subordinated notes or other applicable securities we may need to raise additional debt or equity capital in the future but may be unable to do so we may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide us with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet our commitments and other business purposes our ability to raise additional capital if needed will depend on among other things prevailing conditions in the capital markets which are outside of our control and our financial performance an economic slowdown or loss of confidence in financial institutions could increase our cost of funding and limit our access to some of our customary sources of capital including interbank borrowings repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the federal reserve we cannot be assured that capital will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all any occurrence that may limit our access to the capital markets such as a decline in the confidence of debt purchasers depositors of regions bank or counterparties participating in the capital markets or a downgrade of our debt ratings may adversely affect our capital costs and our ability to raise capital and in turn our liquidity an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a materially adverse effect on our business financial condition or results of operations future issuances of additional equity securities could result in dilution of existing shareholders equity ownership we may determine from time to time to issue additional equity securities to raise additional capital support growth or to make acquisitions further we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees these issuances of our securities could dilute the voting and economic interests of our existing shareholders
