included in part ii item of the annual report on our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations we cannot predict at this time the extent to which the covid19 pandemic will continue to negatively affect our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations the extent of any continued or future adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and outside our control including the scope and duration of the pandemic including the possibility of resurgence of covid19 after initial abatement the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on our employees clients customers counterparties and service providers as well as other market participants and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic the covid19 pandemic has contributed to i increased unemployment and decreased consumer confidence and business generally leading to an increased risk of delinquencies defaults and foreclosures ii sudden and significant declines and significant increases in volatility in financial markets iii ratings downgrades credit deterioration and defaults in many industries including transportation natural resources in particular oil and gas hospitality and commercial real estate iv significant draws on credit lines as customers seek to increase liquidity v significant reductions in the targeted federal funds rate which was reduced to a target rate of between zero and in the first quarter and may be reduced to below zero if the federal reserve determines economic conditions warrant vi increased spending on our business continuity efforts which may in turn require that we further cut costs and investments in other areas and vii heightened cybersecurity information security and operational risks as a result of workfromhome arrangements in addition we also face an increased risk of client disputes litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny as a result of the effects of the covid19 pandemic on market and economic conditions and actions governmental authorities take in response to those conditions we are prioritizing the safety of our customers and employees and have temporarily closed a small number of branches and have limited branch activity to drivethrough services or inoffice appointments additionally approximately of nonbranch associates are working remotely if these measures are not effective in serving our customers or affect the productivity of our associates they may lead to significant disruptions in our business operations many of our counterparties and thirdparty service providers have also been and may further be affected by stayathome or similar orders market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with us or provide essential services even in areas in which stayathome or similar orders have been eased or lifted resurgence of covid19 may require such measures to be reimposed at a later time as a result our operational and other risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides we have experienced an increase in cyber events such as phishing attacks and malicious traffic from outside the united states our layered control environment has effectively detected and prevented any material impact related to these events to date our information security risks are generally expected to remain elevated until the pandemic subsides we are offering special financial assistance to support customers who are experiencing financial hardships related to the covid19 pandemic including waivers of certain withdrawal fees from time deposits and savings and money market accounts loan payment deferrals and extensions credit card payment extensions consumer mortgage payment forbearance and payment deferment suspending initiation of new repossessions of automobiles and other vehicles and suspending new residential property foreclosures on consumer real estate loans if such measures are not effective in mitigating the effects of the covid19 pandemic on borrowers we may experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periodsin addition in many cases the initial periods of payment deferrals extensions and forbearances may soon end which may require us to provide additional assistance or lead to higher rates of default and increased credit losses additionally we are a certified and qualified sba lender and have provided approximately billion in ppp loans these assistance efforts may adversely affect our revenue and results of operations and may make our results more difficult to forecast as the ppp forgiveness process has just begun and the timing and amount of forgiveness to which our borrowers will be entitled cannot be predicted the ppp and other government programs in which we may participate are complex and our participation may lead to governmental and regulatory scrutiny negative publicity and damage to our reputation further regions has been named in lawsuits in connection with its participation in the ppp and may be named in additional lawsuits in the future certain industries where regions has credit exposure including restaurants in particular casual dining restaurants hotels agriculture commercial retail and transportation have experienced significant operational challenges as a result of the covid19 pandemic these negative effects have resulted in a number of corporate lending clients making higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit which may negatively affect our liquidity if current economic conditions persist the effects of the covid19 pandemic may also cause our commercial customers to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral which we expect would cause significant increases in our credit lossesthe pandemic may also alter consumer behavior including spending patterns accordingly certain of these industries may continue to be negatively impacted even after the pandemic has subsided our earnings and cash flows are dependent to a large degree on net interest income the difference between interest income from loans and investments and interest expense on deposits and borrowings net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest the significant reductions to the federal funds rate has led to a decrease in the rates and yields on us treasury securities if interest rates are reduced further in response to the covid19 pandemic we expect that our net interest income will decline perhaps significantly the overall effect of lower interest rates cannot be predicted at this time and depends on future actions the federal reserve may take to increase or reduce the targeted federal funds rate in response to the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions the effects of the covid19 pandemic on economic and market conditions have increased demands on our liquidity as we meet our customers and clients needs during the third quarter of the federal reserve has required large banks including regions to preserve capital by suspending share repurchases capping dividend payments at the amount paid in the second quarter and further limiting dividends according to a formula based on recent net income in addition the federal reserve is requiring large firms including regions to update and resubmit their capital plans later this year to reflect current economic stresses the federal reserve has indicated that it will evaluate these resubmitted plans and that it may extend the restrictions on capital actions on a quarterbyquarter basis as the economic situation continues to evolve we must comply with these restrictions and will otherwise continue to exercise prudent capital management and monitor the business environment in particular if the federal reserve extends the dividend restriction that is based on recent net income and the pandemic continues or worsens it may be difficult for us to maintain our dividend at its current level the covid19 pandemic may impact our assessment of our goodwill during the second quarter of regions concluded that a triggering event had occurred in the second quarter which required regions to perform a quantitative goodwill impairment test the results of the test did not require regions to record a goodwill impairment charge as all three reporting units continued to have a fair value in excess of book value risks to our goodwill assessment are generally expected to increase until the pandemic subsides governmental authorities worldwide have taken unprecedented measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the negative effects of the covid19 pandemic or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity other negative effects of the covid19 pandemic that may impact our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time but it is likely that our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected until the pandemic subsides and the us economy begins to recover further the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled risk factors in our most recent annual report on form 10k and any subsequent quarterly report on form 10q until the pandemic subsides we expect continued draws on lines of credit reduced revenues from our lending businesses increased credit losses in our lending portfolios and decreased fee income even after the pandemic subsides it is possible that the us and other major economies continue to experience a prolonged recession which we expect would materially and adversely affect our business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations
