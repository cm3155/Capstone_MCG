you will and good morning and thank you for joining our call today to discuss the fourth quarter of this was the year of transition for the company and one where we move past integration and quickly move toward execution ive always felt that the best sign of how a merger was progressing was how quickly the company returned to growing its customer base post integration our team moved into growth mode almost immediately and you can certainly see the momentum building in the company were adding customers adding talented bankers and seeing excellent opportunities to grow market share in great markets we were making progress in each of our guiding principles soundness profitability and growth our balance sheet remains very strong and growing and this strength will help us achieve the profitability potential of the bank is a year of internal focus any year where i believe we will make significant further progress in all three areas i will now turn the call over to john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thanks robert good morning everybody i hope you and your families are doing well as we reflect on it was a challenging year in many ways but im proud of the way our team prevailed and successfully completed the largest conversion in our history last summer and as soon as the conversion was complete our bankers turned on the growth we continue to see a lot of positive momentum in the southeast as we accelerate out of this pandemic cycle if we step back and look at loans and deposits this past year in we originated roughly billion in new loans to put that in perspective we originated about billion in before the pandemic and about billion in so saw a to higher lending volume in the past two years and we saw that trend accelerate in the fourth quarter as loan originations increased another from third quarter levels to a new record of billion that level of loan production resulted in annualized loan growth in the fourth quarter compared to loan growth in the third quarter after the vaccines rolled out last spring we guided to midsingle digit loan growth in the back half of and we wound up at so a little better than our guidance the excess liquidity from the feds monetary policy continues to flow on to our balance sheet deposits were up in the fourth quarter even as we drove our deposit cost down to just basis points and the excess liquidity in the system continues to lead to elevated loan payoffs many of our clients have wisely sold their operating businesses at high valuations or sold commercial real estate to lock in the gain from historically low cap rates a few weeks ago the census bureau released the latest population migration trends for and the conclusion is clear the south won the population battle during the pandemic the northeast the midwest and the west all lost population and the south gained people not surprising the southstate footprint is in the fastest growing markets in the country florida ranked number two for population growth behind texas followed by georgia north carolina and south carolina placing southstate in four of the six fastest growing states in america the population growth is driving strong housing demand as well as demand for new construction and really all housing related products including furniture appliances and building materials south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 ill give you a quick update on atlantic capital doug is here to comment on the fourth quarter for atlantic capital they continue to deliver outstanding results with annualized loan growth in the fourth quarter weve now received approvals from both the occ and from the atlantic capital shareholders but were like many acquirers were just waiting for federal reserve approval were hopeful for a close in the next couple months but that is entirely subject to the federal reserve timing as we move into were excited about our momentum weve been intentionally patient about deploying our excess cash cash now makes up of our balance sheet and with an improving economy and accelerating loan growth we have a real opportunity to deploy that excess cash into a higher rate environment and drive our revenue higher in ill turn it over to will so he can give you additional color william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks john ill cover some highlights on margin noninterest income and on interest expense as well as credit and the provision for credit losses slide shows net interest margin trends we had net interest income of million in the quarter the million we reported excluding accretion was our best quarter ever for core net interest income and was up million from the third quarter loan yields exppp were flat with  levels an incremental improvement in our cost of deposits to basis points combined with million growth in average loans helped drive the growth in core net interest income although we deployed some cash into loans and securities our dry powder remains extensive as noted on slide we ended the year with billion in interest earning cash and fed funds sold up million from the third quarter and up billion from a year ago fourth quarter deposit growth was billion some of which we believe to be seasonal or temporary due to municipal tax collections or asset and business sales by clients we estimate the more temporary deposit balance growth to be approximately half of the quarters growth noninterest income improved approximately million from the prior quarter with a record quarter for our correspondent position and improvement in service charge income somewhat offset by a decline in our mortgage revenue as noted on slide mortgage had a strong quarter of production of almost billion but a tightening of margins and a million decline in the pipeline led to a decline in revenue service charge income increased from  due to the ending of waivers and fourth quarter seasonality operating nie was up million from  due to a number of factors one of which was the loan growth incentive kickers being triggered in the back half of the year indiscernible expense categories were slightly higher as noted in the release turning to credit our asset quality metrics continue to be very strong as noted on slide we got another quarter of net loan recoveries before dda chargeoffs of total net chargeoffs of basis points we recorded a million negative provision for credit losses in the quarter given the changing nature of forecasts for fiscal stimulus and the impacts of omicron we weighted moodys s3 scenario of and the baseline scenario of a slightly more conservative weighting than for  ending reserves were of loans or including the reserve for unfunded commitments as noted on slide on the capital front we repurchased approximately  in the fourth quarter bringing the full year total to million shares or approximately of the company our capital return including dividends was approximately million as outlined on slide this represented a total payout ratio dividends and repurchases of approximately of adjusted earnings and approximately of reported earnings south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 ending capital level remained strong with cet1 close to and ending tangible book value per share was ill now turn it over to doug to give a few highlights on atlantic capitals quarter douglas l williams president chief executive officer director atlantic capital bank na thank

diluted share that figure excluding merger related expense was preprovision net revenue for the quarter was million or million excluding merger expense loans held for investment excluding ppp loans grew annualized from the third quarter and for the full year loan origination volume was strong across all of our banking teams and net loan growth was particularly strong in the commercial and industrial and commercial owner occupied real estate categories since atlantic capital became a public company six years ago these commercial loan categories have grown at a compound average growth rate of more than credit quality is excellent net chargeoffs for the quarter were basis points of loans for the full year net chargeoffs were basis points nonperforming assets as percent of total assets was at quarter end and classified loans as a percent of total loans was compared to at the end of as youve seen we recorded a negative provision of for the quarter compared to million last quarter the allowance for credit losses including ppp loans was basis points at quarter end with sharp focus on corporate treasury management business for atlanta based enterprises and for high volume payments and fintech companies across the country atlantic capital has built a strong core deposit franchise since we became a public company six years ago average total deposits have grown more than compounded annually and average demand deposits have grown at a compound average growth rate payments volumes service charges and average deposits in the payments and fintech business grew more than annualized during the quarter for the fourth quarter average noninterest bearing deposits increased annualized on a linked quarter basis and grew yearoveryear noninterest bearing demand deposits averaged more than of average total deposits the average cost of all deposits was basis points as we look ahead to our pending merger with southstate our new business pipelines are robust and we expect continued strong momentum in loan deposit and revenue growth ill be available to answer questions during the qa portion of our call this morning now back to john south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right thanks doug all the pieces are starting to come together the population growth of the southeast the growth in loans at both atlantic capital and southstate and a lot of dry powder in the form of excess cash to invest into a rising rate environment operator please go ahead and open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question today from stephen scouten of piper sandler indiscernible go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone how are you doing john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yes can you hear me okay great so john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp we can can you hear us stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i wonder first maybe yeah i can i can can you hear me john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yes stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co can you guys hear me okay sorry about that john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 yes we can stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co so im curious first i know you spoke to youd been patient about excess cash and i think steve had kind of laid out some targets in terms of liquidity deployment expectations last quarter maybe the quarter previous as well im wondering if you could give us an update there just in terms of how youre thinking about the pace of deployment with where rates have moved to now and where they look to be going steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure stephen its steve i think what weve guided to over the last several quarters is that our investment securities the assets would be somewhere between and by the end of the year and i think right now were around as we think about the future weve got all this excess powder on the balance sheet and today our loan to deposit ratio with and really without acbi is so as we think about the next months our goal is to take this loan to deposit ratio from closer to in the next two years and if we can do that thatll spend a fair amount of the excess liquidity having said that theres still probably billion of still dry after all that and so as we integrate atlantic capital into the mix and investment portfolio well probably have a better guidance as we think about that next quarter once we get the close there but right now theres really no change in that guidance but just from a big picture perspective loan to deposit ratio going towards and in the middle of that well put the securities portfolio together and look at reinvesting it indiscernible opportunistic stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful and then and can you give any color as to where you think expenses are going to go here in maybe preatlantic capital i know that kind of clouds the overall numbers but on a core basis can you talk about where you think expense growth will be and kind of what the drivers of that will be in terms of maybe its new hires maybe its just inflation and kind of how we can think about that william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp sure stephen its will the fourth quarter in a legacy southstate was up a bit from the third quarter and theres a few items that we noted in there in the release and as i mentioned i think in our third quarter call our goal for is to try to hold the inflation and nie to low single digits and thats certainly our plan in our budget we do recognize theres an inflationary environment that were all subject to and that we have to compete in the market but that would be our plan so if you look at the  run rate up a bit from  something in that general range where we were in  to maybe a little bit higher is sort of how we see things shaping up in but again well have to compete with market forces and react accordingly but thats our plan right now stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great well ill let somebody else jump on thanks for the color guys south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 operator thank you stephen well now move over to michael rose of raymond james michael please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions just want to talk about slide i think its really compelling the fact that the origination volumes have been up so nicely yearonyear obviously the pay downs have been an issue doug has obviously grown it at a really high rate as well when do you think the pay down slows is it as rates rise you talked about ma activity and selling businesses and things like that but when can we expect to see a more robust pickup in net loan growth any commentary would be helpful thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah michael its john good morning for the back half of the year we wound up at about annualized loan growth it was in the third quarter this quarter but yeah to your point its kind of interesting our loan production went up but our net growth went down and so we spent some time analyzing that and sure enough we looked at our big payoffs and we had about million more of large payoffs in the fourth quarter than we did in the third and you go down the list and its yeah its family businesses multigenerational operating companies that sold we had a lot of real estate investors that are selling cre at these record low cap rates to get the gain so i do think that interest rates play a big big part of this and the extra liquidity in the system so we kind of thought that at this level of loan production we ought to be producing high singledigits to if we could slow the prepayments down so i think as interest rates drift up youre going to have less prepayments on residential and as interest rates drift up the cap rates are going to move up on cre and those gains are going to be less so theres probably going to be less churn in the cre portfolio so i feel im real pleased with the level of production and if you get a little less liquidity in the system a little higher interest rates it could very easily move into high singledigits to loan growth where were at michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats very helpful thanks john and then maybe just following up on slide because i think this is also pretty compelling i dont know if this is for steve or will but if you can comment on some of the assumptions for that oneyear change which is relatively unchanged from last quarter in terms of what that implies in terms of securities portfolio deployment deposit betas etcetera and then what the impacts could potentially be based on initial purchase accounting marks and the like from the addition of acbi thanks steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yes yeah michael its steve and maybe will can follow up with anything i missed but all this is doing is taking our balance sheet as a point in time static balance sheet thats not growing it for securities or anything like that and just shocking at the rate basis points across the curve and so when you look at that number what it does is it makes the net income of the bank go up about now we all know its not all going to be basis points on one day but this is directionally just tells you as you incrementally move basis points what have you thats how that would play out per our model south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 couple things to note on that slide too is our floating rate loans are around on a daily basis and then we have about another that are variable and a lot of that reprices in the first year and only fixed so that drives some of it but i kind of go back to what really is the asset sensitivity to our entire franchise obviously we have a lot of cash sitting on the balance sheet today that we normally dont have so of assets thats obviously a driver number two our floating rate loan portfolio is probably well within peers and pretty normal for our size but the piece that i think is probably the most important is just our deposit portfolio and the power of our franchise in a rates up environment we have a slide in here that details our deposits but we have of our deposits are in checking accounts versus for our peers and so thats just a significant advantage or change we have checking accounts and million total accounts in higher rates thats when the betas stay lower than hopefully peers and thats where you outperform so all of that is built into this model but hopefully that helps answer your question william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and steven as well ill just elaborate a little bit on that the modeling we use does incorporate our historical deposit betas and as steve just alluded to one thing thats a little bit different this time around is that were entering this rising rate cycle with a much lower loan to deposit ratio if you look back to the last and i think we ended second or third quarter of with a loan deposit ratio in the low to mid or so and as steve said were at today and thats not uncommon so the question will be how different betas this time around given all the liquidity on all of our competitors balance sheets absent a big removal of all that liquidity very rapidly one would expect that betas would be lower across the industry this time around and well see steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp and just to marry up one other thing i know well have 10k disclosures that will come out at some point but this is a net income disclosure not a net interest income disclosure so net interest income disclosure will be closer to but the net income disclosure is what we have here which is probably the more pertinent one that you will hear about michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc helpful because i think thats up quarter on quarter correct because i think the nii sensitivity in the last quarter was closer to and now youre saying for nii william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp its with the shock a ramp was around so that may be it may be what youre thinking michael i dont think its changed that dramatically quarteroverquarter steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp no it hasnt south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay understood maybe just one final one for me so steve maybe if you can go into the increase in correspondent banking this quarter is a little bit more than we are expecting can you just talk about the the puts and takes as we think about thanks steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure yeah it was a really great quarter from the correspondent team and kind of the driver of that this quarter was our interest rate swap business like this quarter was up about million quarter to quarter actually our fixed income business was down couple of million dollars and it really comes back to if you think about the for the environment we were in in the fourth quarter it was just like us there was a lot of loan production that was going on and then also the yield curve was a little bit flatter in the fourth quarter before steeping up in the first quarter so those ingredients along with just great loan production kind of caused the fourth quarter to be very strong and fixed income to be a little weaker but ultimately up million so very happy about that as we think about overall fee income our guidance hasnt changed for that in several quarters i think weve laid it out as a percentage of assets and what weve said is on a standalone southstate would be to basis points on a standalone basis and with atlantic capital combined would be more like to basis points noninterest income to assets and we dont really see that change in a whole lot over the next the course of the next to months so i hope thats helpful michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking all my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you michael operator thank you michael well now move over to a question from jennifer demba from truist jennifer please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc question about your buyback appetite at this point over the next several months how are you thinking about that john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hi jennifer its john the board authorized a buyback of of the company about a year ago and were a little more than halfway through that million shares out of the million so we bought back of the company our thinking is were continuing to generate excess capital we do not believe that were going to be growing theres no need to grow the balance sheet because weve got so much liquidity today so we think well continue to generate excess capital and we think that as interest rates rise in the course of the next year or so bank valuations will improve so we think its a good time to put our capital to use in buybacks so weve been reasonably active in the last two or three quarters and if the valuations stay close to where they are today wed probably continue to stay active the next couple quarters jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay right and what is your outlook on the correspondent banking area for the next year with higher rates steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah jennifer its steve i think what weve said over the course of several quarters is that wed be ranging between million million this quarter we hit million which was a really good quarter for us but i think the same guidance and its kind of the same same as what weve talked about and ill tell you why back to all of this excess liquidity in the banking system and all of our clients they all have this excess liquidity some have more than others and theyre going to do one or two things with it over the next months just like we are either theyre going to loan it or theyre going to invest in and so for us we have the products to both sell them on the fixed income side if the yield curve gets steeper or if the yield curve gets flatter itll probably be more interest rate swap business theres a slide that we put out there on page and it shows the last i think five quarters of fee income for the correspondent we have financial institution clients and you can see its reasonably steady but for different reasons sometimes the arc revenues which is our interest rate swap business does better in the environment and sometimes our fixed income does a little bit better and a lot of that really depends upon the yield curve and how that move so i hope thats helpful jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks so much john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp all right jennifer thank you operator thank you jennifer well take our next question from catherine mealor of kbw catherine please go ahead south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc one more followup on fees on just service charges i was surprised to see the increase this quarter im assuming some of thats just kind of a higher seasonal fourth quarter like we typically see but how do you think about the outlook for service charges and some changes were seeing in overdraft fees in the industry william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp why dont i take the quarter and then let john take the outlook going forward so youre right catherine its two really two components accounted for that roughly million pick up one of it is just seasonal card use christmas shopping etcetera that occurred and then the other bigger factor was we still had some waivers in place in the third quarter post conversion we did the conversion in the second quarter kept some waivers out there fourth quarter those are all expired so we have none of those in the fourth quarter but the combination of those two items really led to the increase quarteroverquarter john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah and as far as going forward clearly the market is moving very quickly catherine as it relates to overdraft fees and practices and i would just tell you that thats something we continually evaluate we continue to make adjustments to and well do that in the future catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc generally as you look at the service charge number its hard because we havent really seen a full kind of normal year of service charges with southstate and centerstate combined since the first time we saw that together was covid so do you think were still not at a full kind of operating run rate that truly shows the benefit of the merger is that fair do you think theres still this kind of headwinds that maybe this quarters run rate is maybe kind of more appropriate base william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp catherine id say my impression is that the fourth quarter did have some seasonality i know we have that most fourth quarters i guess as long as consumer behavior is where it is but the fourth quarter is the first quarter where we didnt have any of the waivers and so if you normalize for a little bit seasonality maybe the fourth quarters run rate is a pretty good look of where we are legacy southstate we dont have a good year of history to show you yet obviously with the conversion occurring in the second quarter and then the waivers that we did and then the fourth quarter of course having some seasonality so south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that makes sense that makes sense and then on loans yields thats actually stayed in a little bit more stable than i was expecting so any kind of color you can give on loan pricing and where you think that loan yield maybe bottoms before we kind of get start to get the benefit of higher rates steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah sure sure catherine this quarter i think our loan yield for the portfolio exaccretion all of that was around ph and our going on yield for loans within the ph range i think for this quarter and a lot of that as you know has to do with where you are out on the curve we had a fair amount of production and a fair amount of that we ended up swapping to floating ratios because we felt like maybe the fed would probably start moving rates ph the same way that our clients did so the way i think about that is if we can get rates to move up from a fed fund libor perspective of portfolio we should be bottoming out here in the next quarter or so and then from there well start increasing with the rest of the market catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great very helpful thank you operator thank you catherine were now going to move over to christopher marinac of janney montgomery christopher over to you christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thank you maam good morning i wanted to ask about the accretion income relative to total nii will the slide you gave was very helpful just as a reminder does that relationship change much with a cbi coming in or will it continue to decline this next two years william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp let me tell you maybe in components so ppp deferred fee accretion thats essentially gone i mean weve got a little bit less in the balance sheet but thats take that or remodel if you hadnt already of course and id say our normalized run rate for the regular ph required accretion as of today we think of that in the sort of the million to million range this quarter its a little bit higher than that and some of thats hard to predict but thats sort of how i think about it we dont anticipate the accretion on the atlantic capital side dramatically changing our accretion we dont think accretion will be a big part of the story post atlantic capital closing so not a big number of addition there in our modeling steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp and chris ill just add that i think what weve said a couple of quarters ago that as we thought about was that our accretion income would be somewhere in that million to million range and after we got through ppp so i think its the same that weve said for the last several quarters south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great steve thanks for that and will thank you as well just a quick follow up on doug and pat from atlanta capital the change in cash and deposits that we saw at period end was any of that seasonal for them and is that something that would come back the first half of the year douglas l williams a president chief executive officer director atlantic capital bank na chris this is doug some of it is seasonal we see that every fourth quarter but theres also some strong organic growth in the midst of all that so i think perhaps it would be modestly lower in the first quarter of this year but not significantly so pat would you patrick timothy oakes a chief financial officer executive vice president secretary treasurer atlantic capital bank na yeah so chris if you look at the average deposit growth right its pretty flat and part of that was thats driving down some deposit costs in particular products that probably caused a decrease if you carve that piece out it was actually up for the quarter and then the period end number it just depends on the day of the week especially with our payments business it was up significantly at because its a thursday and then at yearend it was down because of the day of the week was on a friday so you really have to look at averages when you look at that christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it thanks folks i appreciate that thats helpful douglas l williams a president chief executive officer director atlantic capital bank na and chris the mix has also continued to change more toward noninterestbearing dda dda was noninterest bearing dda was on average in the fourth quarter that was up from the third quarter and those deposit that category of deposits continues to grow at a very strong pace christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc good point doug thank you again operator thank you christopher before we move on to our final question operator instructions well now move over to brody preston of stephens inc brody over to you brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey brody south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 brody preston q analyst stephens inc i wanted to ask just a followup on the arc revenues i just wanted to clarify was that all kind of like what you would consider operating or were there any kind of marktomarket gains within that just because the million quarteroverquarter increase is relatively large steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp no no it was all organic no marktomarket in that i mean if you remember i dont know if ive described it on this call or another but in when the yield curve was flat that business did million in revenue for the year so this quarter of million is a really good quarter but not a record quarter by any means but its better than this than over the last couple of quarters brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thats helpful thank you and then just maybe one more on fees just the mortgage production it looks like you are continuing the balance sheet a relatively larger mix of mortgage production than you historically have so i guess i wanted to ask one why and then two if the gain on sale margins are going to track this level going forward do you envision maintaining that mix of portfolio versus secondary just given that the margins are starting to get a little slimmer steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah brody this is steve i think youre referencing page and hopefully this disclosure that will put together in the last couple of quarters has been helpful and its helpful for me as we look at it yeah the mortgage production ph perspective its very robust i mean it was almost billion for this quarter last quarter was billion and then fourth quarter last year which was an excellent quarter was billion so really yeartoyear the production which is a record year for us was billion this year we did billion so congratulations to that team theyve just been really working hard and doing well the things that strike me on this page are a couple of things one is if you look at the trend on the gain on sale margins a year ago they were now theyre well the is just much more of a normalized gain on sale margins so theres nothing to be alarmed about that its just more normal but thats down basis points which is obviously taking away some of the fee income and thats why i think what you see in the top right column there is were moving more of that production which was a year ago secondary now down to secondary and so i would assume that as we kind of move forward here in the higher rates and were getting more opportunities to do arms on balance sheet well have more of an opportunity to continue kind of that mix so i would say that secondary portfolio would probably be a good mix and some of the things that are driving that again to the portfolio is just theres just a lot of new construction on single family homeowners who are kind of there and doing a custom built house because theres just not a lot of inventory so were doing a lot of that and were doing a construction loan and then are putting an arm on it on the back end so anyway its a lot of commentary but i would just describe its a really strong production year for that portfolio we saw in the fourth quarter consumer real estate went up around if you pulled out indiscernible its been more like so i kind of see that as sort of a good run rate going forward south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thats very helpful thank you for that and then just on the origination yields the ph was down bps i think quarteroverquarter similar to the core loan yield without any accretion and so i guess just as we think about new origination yields going forward i know that weve all got our own different kind of fed rate hike assumptions but do you expect maybe further compression on new origination yields in the first and second quarter of the year depending on what the fed does can you help us think about that steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah probably the way i would say it is average loan size this quarter was up a little bit and so typically as you get a higher new loan origination those spreads tighten up a little bit just because of the nature of that so i guess it probably depends upon our mix at the end of the day we have a loan pricing model that prices to the curve and so as the curve moves up we still want to continue to get our spreads and theres always a dance in there particularly when rates rise for the first quarter or two but long term that model works and overtime you do get the spreads the question is with all the liquidities getting in the system will you get it this year or this time which is a great question i dont think any of us know the answer i do know that when securities yields go to you can do it risk free it makes it a whole lot easier on the loans to be more disciplined on that brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then just on the loan growth rate particularly within ci so you all had a good year here i think it was up like when you excluded ph amp ppp related loans but this quarter was a little bit light relative to ph h8 and what some of your peers were putting up and so i wanted to ask was there anything specific that drove that beyond the business sales that you noted john and if you could help us think about the size of those paydowns within ci it would be helpful john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp sure brody if you recall in the third quarter we had a seasonal surge in ci loans that was attributed to some hurricane cleanup business that we do and we mentioned that that would start to tail off seasonally in the fourth quarter and the first quarter so that was a little bit of a headwind but were still happy yearoveryear ci has grown and a lot of that is attributable to the middle market bankers that greg lapointe has recruited and brought in to the company but i do think that this particular quarter at a growth it was probably that seasonality to hurricane business as well as just more of these operating companies selling and paying off at a higher rate than they did in the third quarter brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you for that and if i could just sneak in just a couple more quick ones on slide you have given really good detail around the checking accounts and i wanted to ask do you know if that twothird and onethird mix of commercial versus retail checking and its similar to what it was last cycle on a pro forma basis south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2022 steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah brody this is steve i dont think weve checked that number its a good question but i dont think weve looked at it preloe william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp indiscernible yeah i dont think so i would ignorantly say its close to that brody but we havent put that together so good question brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay okay and then just one on the securities book do you happen to know what the duration the effective duration of the afs portfolio is and then for the total portfolio do you know what percent of the book is floating rate steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah i think our effective duration for the entire book is around years i think the floating piece is about of the book so really most of those are fixed securities when we and as part of my comments when we bring on the book for acbi they have a little bit of a longer portfolio well examine all of that when we put the fair value marks depending on ph which day we close and put all that together at that point william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and brody that was for the full portfolio the answer steve gave we dont it have broken up by afs and htm my guess would be that afs would be a little bit shorter just good way ph you put an htm tip we dont have it precisely in front of us brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i really appreciate it john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you operator thank
