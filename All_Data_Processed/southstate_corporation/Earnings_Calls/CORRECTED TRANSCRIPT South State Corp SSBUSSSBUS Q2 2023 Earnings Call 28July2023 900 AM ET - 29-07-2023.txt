executive officer director south state corp thank you will good morning everyone thanks for joining us when we had our last earnings call in april the banking industry was still in the fog of war three months later the fog is starting to clear liquidity is stabilizing the new regulatory framework is coming into focus and southstate is in a position of relative strength for the next phase of the cycle were pleased to report that for the first half of ppnr per share grew by compared to the first half of last year and so far this year loan and deposit growth has been slightly better than our guidance youll recall that for we plan to keep deposits flat and for loans to grow at a midsingle digit pace we projected the loan growth would be faster in the first half of the year and a little slower in the back half of the year were now at the halfway point for and deposits are up and loans have grown at a annualized pace so balance sheet growth is on track our geographic business model has proven to be a competitive advantage for deposit pricing our regional presidents have done a superb job of efficiently using exception authority to protect our core relationships while effectively managing deposit costs and it helps that southstate has the lowest average deposit size of our peer group at per account and that granularity translates to stability the longterm value of a bank is on the right side of the balance sheet and our granular and relationshipbased deposit funding has resulted in a cumulative deposit beta of just this cycle and were pleased to have had growth in customer deposits in the second quarter credit metrics are starting to normalize but chargeoffs remain very low in the last year we conservatively set aside million in loan loss reserves to cover only million in chargeoffs the result is that weve bolstered our reserve including unfunded loans by basis points from a year ago to a current allowance for credit losses over at we believe the strength of our reserves and our capital base will give us an extra level of optionality as we enter the next phase of the cycle the southeast has proven to be the winner and it should continue to be the winner in a postpandemic economy population growth and job growth are remarkably strong and thats driving real estate values and new home construction southstate operates in four of the six fastest growing states in the country and with the recent announcements of several new multibillion dollar electric vehicle plants and battery plants and with tourism fully recovered we see the momentum in the southeast extending well beyond this decade we dont have a crystal ball and we dont know the ramifications of the feds policies as hard as we try but we are firm believers that granular and relationshipbased deposit funding disciplined underwriting and high growth markets and an entrepreneurial team of bankers is the recipe for success regardless of the feds interest rate policies and with that ill flip it back to will to walk you through the details of the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you john ill go through a few details but i think a high level summary of the quarter is that we put up a solid ppnr though our nim compressed a bit to million our deposit costs were in line with where we south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 expected them to fall we had forecasted an increase of to basis points and they moved up basis points from  to basis points we had solid growth in both loans and deposits so we expect our loan growth to slow down in the back half of the year our noninterest income performed well exceeding our expectations and conversely expenses were a little higher than expected largely due to some items theyre not expected to recur on the balance sheet our annualized loan growth brings our first half growth rate to as i said we expect this to moderate for the final two quarters of the year deposits grew at a solid annualized rate or if you exclude the approximately million in brokerage cd maturities we didnt replace like others we continue to see a mixshift in our deposits from dda into money market accounts and cds dda is represented of our total deposits at quarter end down from last quarter prepandemic this figure was to so we appear to be moving toward prepandemic levels of dda as a percentage of deposits turning to the income statement our million was down basis points from  loan yields were up basis points but deposits were up basis points bringing our cycletodate deposit beta to our net interest income of million was approximately equal to what we reported for the third quarter noninterest income was up million to million the best quarter weve had since last years second quarter it was led by correspondent which had million in revenue after million in interest expense on swap collateral for million and gross revenue this continues to be a difficult environment for fixed income but our interest rate swap business had a very good quarter mortgage and wealth had solid quarters similar to  levels and deposit fees recovered to levels we saw in  as i said expenses came in higher than expected this quarter a few factors impacting the quarters nie compensation expense was up million around half of which was higher commission expense we recorded million expense accrual for litigation and we recorded an adjustment for our fdic assessment during the quarter to reflect the new assessment rate effective this year our quarterly run rate going forward for fdic insurance expense should be approximately million excluding any special assessment and excluding other regulatory charges those two nonrecurring items the litigation accrual and the fdic adjustment along with the higher commission expense total around million looking ahead our teams annual merit increases are effective july subject to some variations and expense categories impacted by noninterest income and performance we expect operating nie in the next couple of quarters to be in the low to mid240 million with respect to credit we continued to build loan loss reserves in the face of a possible recession with million in provision expense against only million in net chargeoffs over the last four quarters weve averaged 1basis point in net chargeoffs for a total of million while recording million in provision expense for a million build in total reserves in one year this brings our total reserve to just shy of billion and basis points of loans up basis points from a year ago we knew the historically low levels of npas and criticized and classified loans weve enjoyed the last few quarters were not sustainable we saw those metrics tick up a bit in  though they remain at very moderate south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 levels ill note that almost of our nonperforming loans are current on payments like last quarter we included in the presentation some additional credit information on areas of interest we continue to have very strong capital ratios with ce tier above or if aoci were included in the calculation our tce ratio improved slightly to with capital retention slightly offset by a higher aoci impact versus  due to increases in interest rates as i noted we expect to see slower loan growth in the next couple of quarters so riskweighted asset growth should be lower than what we experienced in the second quarter with our solid capital position and our capital formation rate we expect to continue to build and retain capital though we may potentially utilize our buyback authorization to repurchase shares should conditions warrant operator well now take questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of catherine mealor with kbw your line is open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i thought ill start with the margin and just see if we could get an updated thoughts on how youre thinking about the margin in the back half of the year the deposit beta has just been so good and just curious if you think thats sustainable in the back half of the year if we still have a little bit more of a catch up coming thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yes catherine this is steve thanks for the question and maybe just to back up for a second last quarter our guidance was really kind of three things one was interest earning assets around billion our deposit costs were to increase to basis points they increased basis points so that was kind of right in line and then the third piece of guidance we said was that our full year nim expectation for would be between and and then of course second quarter came right in line with that so as we think about going forward the rest of the year then theres three really big assumptions around that interest earning assets being the first our rate forecasting in the second deposit being the third on the first one our interest earning assets is around billion for the full year we havent changed that guidance start out a little lower its trending a little higher but basically pretty steady in south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 as it relates to the second assumption our rate forecast during the april call we forecasted rates based on the moodys baseline to peak at but of course based on the latest fed rate hike this week and the moodys consensus were expecting fed funds rate to stay flat at through the rest of the year before decreasing in the first quarter of and then going to by the end of thats whats built into our forecast and then the last assumption is just around deposit beta and as we mentioned we have a page in the deck on page of our investor deck that shows our cycletodate deposit beta is at versus our historical beta from last cycle was in april we did give guidance that we expect that our deposit beta to finish up in the high 20s due to the march banking turmoil we continue to reiterate that expectation based on what were seeing and so as we think about based on our interest rate forecast we would expect deposit cost to increase basis points to basis points in the third quarter and for the deposit cost to end the year between million and million in the fourth quarter which is up about basis points to basis points from the current level so you kind of put all that together and in summary we based on these assumptions we expect nim to be between million to million in the back half of and we reiterate our fullyear nim guide of million to million for as we think of going forward and of course theres a lot of assumptions going forward in really our biggest change would be just we expect our interest earning asset to grow in so we expected to average around billion for as we continue to grow loans and continue to grow the balance sheet and that the nim would be relatively stable in that million to million range just based on all those assumptions so thats a longwinded answer to your question but i think hopefully that encapsulates the margin question catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that is really great perfect thank you so much steve and maybe just thinking about the margins for because i think for the rest of the year it makes perfect sense but as we think to im assuming loan yields is really the biggest factor there if we assume the fed stays at million and even cuts in the next year the big question is what can loan yields do into next year and this quarter i noticed loan yield changes fell back a little bit from the pace that weve seen in the past couple of quarters any commentary on what drove that every quarter can be kind of different but just maybe can you give us some thoughts on loan repricing and maybe within that guidance where youre thinking loan yields to the end of the year and upside if we move into next john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah catherine i think last quarter we answered this sort of question on the call and i think what we were talking about that based on the forecast we thought loan yield for our total portfolio would end between and at the fourth quarter so theres really no change to that and thats probably why our nim guidance really hasnt really changed a whole lot we would expect that the loan yields would continue to increase one based on the fed rate hike two based on new production and three the last is just the maturing or repricing adjustable fixed rate loans that represents about billion a quarter that is sort of repricing somewhere in that to range and of course over south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 so those are kind of the three things that give us some confidence in the loan yield continuing to increase over time catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it great thanks for the help appreciate it great quarter operator your next question is from the line in stephen scouten with piper sandler your line is open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys appreciate it i guess i appreciate the commentary around million in provisions only million in net chargeoffs we can see the reserve build but are there any other dynamics at play there thats leading to a little bit more elevated provisions than what maybe i dont know i would expect from my side of things william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yes stephen its will the short answer is the biggest driver to the provision this quarter was the change in the commercial real estate price index forecast but let me maybe back up just a second sort of talk about our model our model is built on historical loss data for different bank charters that make up indiscernible southstate from the period of to so obviously looking at different economic environments different loss rates that occurred in those different environments and then running regression analyses we have to also on top of that though incorporate a qualitative overlay to account for the different nature of some loan portfolios particularly construction loan portfolio which as you might imagine heading into the great financial crisis in the timeframe was much more heavily speculative land acquisition and development it was in some cases definitely well over half of the construction portfolio where today its a minuscule fraction almost on an exceptiononly basis whereas were doing more industrial and multifamilytype lending in that construction category so we have a qualitative overlay to adjust for that factor but you have to keep in mind that cecl its a forward looking measure and so the increase that we show is not based on what we see in our portfolio but rather based upon drivers the changes in the loss drivers particularly cre price index in this quarter stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay and the big move from the unfunded reserve to the funded is that about loan fundings or is that still kind of more modeldriven into what you just spoke to will william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp its a combination of the two our unfunded portion of the loan commitments is reducing as were not refilling the pipeline as much with construction loans and also just reflects some of the loss drivers in the different segments and the qualitative overlays south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp we tend to view indiscernible we tend to view the total reserves the basis points versus just the reserve on the loans themselves its all capital set aside to cover loan losses so stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co absolutely yes perfect okay and then on the loan growth guidance kind of lower in the back half of the year thats very consistent which i appreciate i know like this quarter looked like investors cre and resi mortgage were the two biggest drivers is one or both of those falling off more so than anything else is that why loan growth will back off or whats kind of is it just more conservatism can you give me some color on that dynamic john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah itd the residential loan growth category stephen i mean thats grown far beyond our forecast for the first half of the year basically in the southeast with all this population migration theres more buyers than sellers theres a lack of inventory so weve been financing new home construction for end users not for builders but for the end users but we see that residential production moderate in the back half of the years we just adjust the mortgage rates higher stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp and stephen what i would add is that we have a slide in the deck and i think probably this is last time we put it in there but page which speaks to kind of residential loan growth over the past really three years and what you notice is when rates are low we typically sell more in the secondary when rates are higher we put more in the portfolio if you looked at that whole three years and you said whats your compounded growth rate over that threeyear period for residential its right at and so as we think about managing our balance sheet and our capital allocation weve sort of got it back to where we think the longterm average is and growing at a quarter from here doesnt make as much sense so i think weve kind of allocated what we were going to allocate now weve just got to grow it with the rest of the portfolio stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yes thats great and then just last thing for me obviously the nim guidance was very detailed appreciate that steve and no pressure on that basis point change quarteroverquarter you did so well this quarter and now south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 were all going to expect it to be right again but im wondering within that guidance whats the noninterest bearing deposit percentage look like in your models in your thinking is it which is phenomenal but down from where do you think thats going to trend from here stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah so in our models were at at the end of the quarter which fell from last quarter and most of that of course which is the business dda side of it prior to so in the last cycle we ended up in i think in that range so just based on our forecast were getting to that level by the end of the year so we think theres a couple of percent degradation although like everything else thats going accelerating so much over the next few quarters is kind of how were thinking about it stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect great appreciate all the color guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thanks stephen operator your next question is from the line of kevin fitzsimmons with da davidson your line is open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies hey good morning guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning kevin william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies i was just wondering on the deposit cost headwinds the level of competition the mixshift that we just were speaking about a minute ago weve had a few banks cite that theyve observed that easing over the course of the quarter and specifically here in the last in the month of june and coming into july is that consistent with what youre seeing are you seeing some of those headwinds abating or not necessarily is it just as fierce in terms of the pace that youre dealing with it stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 hi kevin this is steve yeah thats consistent with what were seeing certainly that can change but thats really built into our guidance last quarter we guided between and basis points for the quarter this year were sort of in the to basis points range and thats consistent with what were seeing today and probably consistent with the industry certainly anything else can happen that would move or change that but right now thats sort of where were seeing it kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies okay all right and steve i apologize if it was said and i missed it but it was a very good quarter for correspondent and capital markets as will pointed out earlier on the swap side can you update us on what your outlook or how we should be thinking about noninterest income if were looking at like a run rate in second quarter of million how we should be thinking about that going forward stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure kevin youre right so with the fee income of million the way we think about it basis points of assets which was better than our guide of between and basis points the biggest driver as you mentioned was correspondent and really it came down to our interest rate swap revenue and if you think about the environment in the second quarter one of the things that happened was we had much lower 10year treasury and then we had some conversions on libor that sort of drove some of the revenue the way were thinking about that business for the back half of the year is sort of back at its first quarter levels because the 10year treasury is now picked up to about so that sort of drives a little bit of that as were thinking about obviously service charges came up a little bit too we think that probably comes down a little bit and it rebounds in the fourth quarter like it usually does but from here i think our guidance really hasnt changed i think its sort of that to basis points for the rest of the year and then as we think about the get clarity on the fed rate hikes and maybe even potential cuts in wed expect in that the noninterest income to average assets would start moving up from more in that to basis points due to these interest rates interest since the businesses like mortgage and correspondent which tend to do a lot better during a period of stable to lower rate so really no change we had a really good quarter were not expecting quite those levels going forward for at least the next couple of quarters but into wed expect the sort of rebound back just due to the fact that the feds a little bit more stable kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies okay great and i think i know the answer to this but just want to ask you guys are cash flowingly the available for sale securities i would imagine at some point aoci is going to unwind for you but weve had a few banks pull the trigger on chunkier bonds restructuring transactions and just wondering if thats something thats on the table or on the radar for you guys given your strong capital that you could kind of accelerate that process or not thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 yeah sure kevin i mean its certainly something that weve talked about and we always want to keep our options open because as you know things change yield curve levels change shape of the yield curves change i think the way we think about it is were really balancing kind of three things capital earnings and liquidity so as we think about nim potentially stabilizing here youd probably see less of a need to do that but at the same time as the yield curve changed and moved down and there was an opportunity we might want to do it so i guess thats really a nonanswer but i think we always look at it but theres nothing burning that makes us want to do it but at the same time there could be an opportunity at some point if the yield curve allows kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson companies okay thanks very much guys operator your next question is from the line of michael rose with raymond james your line is open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions hey steve i just wanted to confirm that the margin guide that you gave includes purchase accounting accretion or is that on a core basis just trying to clarify stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah no it does it includes all of the above purchase accounting accretion continues to move down you saw it move down a few million this quarter i think and wed expect that to kind of continue to move down through so it really becomes less of a story when youre having several million worth of nim so i think yeah all that includes everything michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great and i just wanted to circle back to loan growth one slide that really sticks out to me is slide where you have kind of a gdp in the footprint being in line with japan and above germany why are you guys not giving your footprint why is growth not stronger i know you said its kind of decelerating and some of thats just a fund up of some of the construction stuff that was on the books thats waning is it more of a measured approach from you all or is it just the market is really your markets are slowing down and theres just not as many opportunities thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah i think michael its a measured approach from our bankers and its a measured approach from our clients our ci clients theres still good business in the marketplace but as they think about making large strategic decisions and theyre thinking about the implications of an inverted yield curve and a potential recession in theyre just being more cautious and then you go back to cre and clearly with the interest rate environment like it is a lot of these deals dont pencil out for us as underwriters they dont pencil out for the developers it requires them to put cash south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 in the deals so that activity is slowing down and thats what the fed is designed i think thats what the fed wants to happen so we dont want to fight the fed here from a growth standpoint but i would tell you as i think about different regions of the country about the amount of opportunities for loan growth that were going to see in the next couple of years i think will be at a faster pace than other areas of the country and i think when it comes to potential recessionary risk its going to be a lot less in the southeast michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great thats good color john i appreciate it and maybe just one final one for me you guys are trading around of tangible i know you talked about maybe some buybacks but we have seen two kind of larger deals this week i mean whats the outlook for ma here just given that you have a stronger currency and if you were to look at something i mean is there a preferred size range would you consider an moe i think theres going to be a lot of interesting things that happen but we just love your overall thoughts on how you view ma at this point thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp i think those two deals kind of caught everybody a little bit by surprise last week in the short term there are obvious headwinds the economic uncertainty the interest rate markets on this deal math and then the regulatory approval process is just too long so thats the short term but from a longterm standpoint the logic is there if weve got an inverted yield curve and theres continued revenue pressures and were starting to see michael a dispersion of multiples that could drive a good accretion in ma but really our guidance hasnt changed as we think about good partners for us ideally we would like to partner with banks that are about to a third of our size our preference geographically would be to double down in the great markets that were in and if we ever look to expand into an area outside of our market wed want it to be similar high growth markets that were already in michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate the color john thanks everyone operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 i was hoping to maybe just dig in a little bit more granularly on the margin i was wondering steve do you guys have any loan just because the loan yield i know is still kind of on track to kind of get into the range you outlined but it came up a little bit less than what i was looking for and so is there any i guess within kind of the billionplus unfunded commitment that you have is there anything thats like funding up that as maybe coming on at yields that were agreed to a year ago or something like that thats a bit below the market right now thats kind of stopping that loan yield from moving towards the high end of the million that you expect stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp its a good question i think some of this has to do with the number of days in a quarter and all those kinds of things you think about the first quarter for instance one of the things that can drive some distortion maybe is just around like february is a 28day month and you have ph loans that sort of make that yield a little higher theres things like that i dont think theres anything back to what we forecasted last quarter and what were forecasting this quarter hasnt changed for kind of the back half of the year so i dont think theres anything that were seeing that kind of keeps us from being in that million to million range by the end of the year based on what we see but some of that is our models have repricing in them and ones that adjust with our loans that are maturing those kinds of things but theres nothing in there that i think is unusual or anything that the question you asked i dont have right off the top of my head i dont think theres anything thats really driving them brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it and then i did also want to ask on the opposite side of the ledger just the transactional money market cost of deposits theyre up again but they held in i think quite a bit better than some of your peers and so i was wondering kind of what the interest rate youre paying on money market is for kind of negotiated rates with your business clients or just a broad kind of average rate like any detail you can give us there would be helpful john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah obviously so much of that remix this quarter was in the business dda going into business money market so thats that and then as it relates to the rates that are paid on those particular accounts is really driven by so much of it being relationship pricing and so it really the answer is it depends i think our average money market rate for the quarter was in the high maybe kind of range and of course you saw a huge remix into from business money market or business dda to business money market so i would i guess the question really that youre asking is when does that slowdown so if we have another or so that moves in you could continue to see that money market rate move up i remember looking back and this is a long time and it was different bank but when fed funds was around our money market average rate was in the range so it doesnt surprise me a whole lot that were sort of trending towards that at the end of this rate hiking cycle but obviously this cycle has been different and so its hard to predict but thats maybe some data points for you brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 okay could i ask just on that remix thats happening from the business checking to the business money market we can see that pretty well on the end of period balance sheet but those two categories get consolidated for the average balance sheet and so did any of that happen later in the quarter that might have influenced the cost of deposit being lower than we should expect going forward john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp i think the events of march really kicked in some of that remix in april and probably may and certainly to a lesser extent june so i think back to our earlier comments on the cost of deposits what other banks are seeing and sort of that a little bit of a deceleration i would say that probably most of that was maybe a little bit it was all throughout the quarter but id say more heavily weighted toward april and may versus june brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i just had a couple left will i guess the litigation expense was that for anything specific i was just kind of wondering what that was and then the guidance you gave for expenses the low240 million to mid million it implies just a small but it implies a step up in the expense guide just a little bit off of the full year million that you had talked about before is there anything specific thats kind of driving that as well william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yes so the litigation accrual was related to the settlement of a case from thats been out there for a while and we had it accrued for mediation and finally got it settled so thats accrued up for that amount the expense guide yeah that is little bit above that million range if you put them all together id say the hard thing to predict there as you know one would be variable compensation expense associated with some of the variable revenue business lines commission et cetera thats a component that depends upon those the other is loan production volume impacts the fas loan origination cost deferral as well so thats one thats hard to predict if loan volume slows down youll have less of that as an nie offset those will be two of the things and then as you go through the year you are first going to chew up your incentive compensation through the rest of the year and thats one that has some variability to it so thats all those are some of the things that are in there that lead to that being a range like it is brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that detail and then the last one i had was i did notice that when i was kind of comparing the investor cre sides quarteroverquarter i did notice that there was a step up in substandard and special mention office portfolio i wanted to ask if that was a result of any reappraisals that you had done or if it was something different john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah brody its the second quarter of the year so this is when we get in a lot of the yearend financial statements so weve been actively doing this normal servicing of the commercial loan portfolio and to your point on page you can kind of see that over the last year special mention loans have been trending lower substandard loans have drifted higher if you put it all together were roughly flat from about where we were a year ago south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 but we are seeing a mix and i think its predictable weve been upgrading hotel loans coming out of the pandemic and weve been putting some of the office deals on watch if you look at our npas today nearly of i think will said this in the prepared remarks nearly of them are current on payments about million have a government guarantee there were two ci credits that migrated to nonperformers in the second quarter one we feel pretty good about we dont think theres a loss the other one might have a charge in the third quarter but based upon what we know today we should finish the calendar year with total chargeoffs probably at or below basis points brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for that i appreciate it guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp sure operator your next question comes from the line of david bishop with the hovde group your line is open david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen most of my questions have been asked and answered but i guess one final question maybe on the new loan origination deals just curious where you saw those trending this quarter relative to last and are you seeing any differential or better pricing in some of your markets than others just curious what youre seeing overall in terms of new loan origination yields stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah david this is steve they did improve for the quarter and i guess i dont have the data right in front of me as far as where they trended up from in the first quarter but part of it is i do have residential loan yields which i think was in the range give or take and so as we think about the commercial loan yields are much higher than that and so as we think about moderating the loan growth in the back half of the quarter most of thats going to be in residential well start seeing that new loan yield probably be over is probably where were thinking i think were in the high give or take in the second quarter but as we kind of move residential down which is a lower yielding where we think its safe for assets really it will move us back towards that is kind of where we are thinking david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it and then one final question the guidance in terms of loan yield expectations i hear it was million to million john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28jul2023 yeah just to be clear that would be in the fourth quarter and we would expect it to move kind of in between here and there in the third quarter so thats all part of the margin guidance but yeah we would expect the loan yield to be roughly in that
