will good morning everybody thanks for joining us as youve seen in our earnings release southstate delivered a solid and steady quarter that was consistent with our guidance at a high level it was another quarter of positive but modest growth for both loans and deposits asset quality continues to be good with past dues nonaccruals and chargeoffs all declining in the quarter net interest margin dipped to the low end of our guidance but should be at or near bottom and capital ratios are on the higher end of our peer group and have grown every quarter over the last year like every other banker and investor were trying to understand the broader macro picture the risk of a recession and what the yield curve is going to look like at the same time we believe the dynamics will be different in every region of the country as we study our bank and our markets commercial loan pipelines took a sharp drop of about following the banking turmoil last spring and they stayed low through the summer and early fall but by november pipelines started growing again and in the last few months have now returned to the same level they were before the banking turmoil and the momentum seems to be building which is encouraging but with rates where they are cre activity not surprising is much slower so nearly all the pipeline growth and momentum has been in the ci portfolio in fact as it relates to commercial real estate our concentration ratios for both cre and construction are at the lowest levels theyve been in three years dan bockhorst and our credit team are doing a great job servicing and analyzing our loan portfolio and while rising interest rates are putting pressure on debt service coverage ratios the south is disproportionately benefiting from net migration and we clearly see that in the rental rate trends on all types of commercial real estate in the last three years rental rates in our markets have increased for office compared to outside our markets rental rates are up in multifamily versus outside our markets and rents are up in industrial compared to outside our markets on fee income we were up for the quarter we saw some improvement in mortgage as the gain on sale margin opened up wealth management continues to be a reliable and growing contributor and we now have assets under management over billion and our correspondent division recently expanded with the addition of a new team that specializes in the packaging and sale of the government guaranteed portion of sba loans this is a longstanding and experienced team based in houston and steve can give you more information and finally as we think about capital management over the last year weve maintained a level balance sheet its billion in assets while earning a return on tangible common equity in the midteens as a result weve seen our capital ratios increase every quarter our cet1 currently sits at about weve also significantly increased our loan loss reserves which currently sit at i mentioned earlier that were all trying to play economist and forecast the yield curve and obviously we dont have a crystal ball and the only thing we know for sure is that all of our forecasts will be wrong so our goal is flexibility and optionality and with these higher levels of capital and reserves were in a perfect position to be opportunistic regardless if we have a soft landing a hard landing or no landing at all ill pass it back to will now to walk you through the details on the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 thank you john total revenue for the quarter was in line with forecasts as nim came in at the lower end of our guidance range at and noninterest income to average assets came in above guidance at basis points deposit costs increased basis points which was basis points less than last quarters increase and the cost of deposits at was in line with our guidance loan yields increased basis points that brings our cumulative total of deposit beta to and our cumulative loan beta to deposit mix shift was part of that deposit cost increase though the shift appears to have slowed the average mix of ddas to total deposits at and  was down from q4s average however q1s beginning ending and average mix were all in the range steve will give some color on our future margin guidance in the qa relative to  our net interest income declined million with one fewer day noninterest income was million higher total revenue declined by million sequentially the noninterest income beat was driven by better mortgage revenue and lower interest on swap variation margin collateral nie excluding nonrecurring items was down million versus  but thats partially due to the adoption of the proportional amortization method for low income housing tax credits this adoption shortens the period over which these credits are amortized and essentially reduced nie by a net million and moved about million in passive losses to the income tax line thus in comparing nie and ppnr for  versus  on a normalized basis if you adjust for this accounting method adoption  nie would have been down million compared with  and  ppnr would have been down million from  we had some positives and negatives in nie the first quarter had the usual higher fica and 401k expense which was offset by lower professional fees associated with projects as well as lower business development and travel expense for the full year we still think nie in the million to billion area is a good estimate dependent of course on expense items that vary with revenue with respect to income taxes in addition to the impact of the accounting method adoption i mentioned we had two nonrecurring items related to a state dta revaluation and amended state tax returns driving our tax expense up by million for future quarters we expect to see an effective tax rate in the range absent any other unanticipated discrete or nonrecurring adjustments our million and provision for credit losses versus million and net chargeoffs caused our total reserve to grow by basis points to npas were down slightly we saw some continued loan migration into substandard as we monitor and downgrade credits due to higher interest costs with many of these being floating rate borrowers that could reduce their rate by basis points or so if they fix their rate using the swap curve but many are reluctant to do so at this point due to expectations of lower rates or a sale ill note that the largest addition to the substandard list from  paid off in  with the properties selling for an amount that was approximately of our loan balance that was clearly a substandard loan with very little risk of loss as evidenced by the margin of safety and the sale price versus our loan balance only one quarter after our downgrade ill note that our expectation continues to be that we will not see significant losses in the loan portfolio based upon current forecasts lastly on the balance sheet front growth was moderate with loans up annualized and deposits up annualized with brokered cds essentially flat we repurchased another  in the quarter and our capital ratios remain very healthy putting us in a good position with plenty of optionality we believe operator well now take questions southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you and we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and we will take our first question from stephen scouten with piper sandler your line is open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone thanks for the time here im just wondering if you guys can walk through kind of how youre thinking about the nim from here i think last quarter we were looking at four cuts in maybe and four in so just given the move in the forward curve and how that might shift gear your guidance on the nim stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp sure stephen this is steve good morning yeah as you mentioned just to kind of give you the framework of the nim discussion last quarter were at deposit costs were kind of our guidance going forward continues on three things its interest earning assets our rate forecast and deposit beta so on our interest earning assets the first part wed mentioned full year would be average around billion so theres really no change to that guidance we still think loan growth is sort of midsingledigit we think deposit growth is in that to range and then we use the investment portfolio runoff to fund that loan growth so i think from an interest earning asset that really hasnt changed on the rate forecast last quarter i think moodys i mentioned four rate cuts in and four and this quarter moodys baseline shows two cuts in and four cuts in so thats two less two fewer rate cuts than we originally projecting the third piece is just deposit beta page shows our cycletodate beta and we would expect quarter going forward that deposit costs to increase sort of in the basis points to basis points in the second quarter and some assuming we get a rate cut in the third quarter which is what the moodys baseline says we would peak somewhere in the mid1 on deposit costs so with all those assumptions we would expect nim for the full year to range between and and sort of start from the lower end than the first quarter to the higher end in the fourth quarter and as you mentioned i think at the previous quarter we guided to and really the difference in the guidance is based on the rate cut forecast having only two cuts versus four cuts which really cost us about basis points in so thats kind of how were thinking about based on the moodys baseline and happy to answer any additional questions on that stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah no thats really helpful steve and so based on that change you guys in practice look like youre slightly liability sensitive then if the nim is a little better with more cuts and does this move into more ci lending does that start to change that dynamic slowly over time southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp i think stephen it probably does over time but i dont think it materially changes anything in the short run i mean one of the questions that investors have asked us is if rate cut stay flat kind of how does that affect your nim and for us weve talked about our fixed rate book our fixed rate loan book that continues to be sort of a tailwind to margin and this quarter our total loan yield went up i think basis points so well probably continue to see that somewhere between basis points and basis points of movement in the loan yield on a goforward basis assuming higher for longer in the rate cuts and our deposit costs probably will go up somewhere between basis points and basis points if we continue on this path so we kind of see sort of the nim bottoming out and then for us we think that each rate cut from here whenever that happens and its somewhere between basis points and basis points of nim improvement per cut and so we can go into that math if youd like at some point but thats sort of how were thinking about that to range if we have to cuts we probably see it getting in the upper by the end of the year if were no rate cuts its probably sort of that the range would be our current expectation stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it very helpful and then just the last thing for me what kind of metrics might you guys have on hand and you looked at stressing your portfolio for higher rates for potentially higher for longer and what that looks like as these fixed rate loans reprice higher do you have any metrics kind of showing what happens to debt service coverage or kind of what gives you comfort around the loan book as a whole john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah steve we had a tick up in our substandards really for the last few quarters and it went up a little bit this quarter little less than it did the prior quarter and to your point its predominantly a rising rate story and then some of its from tenant downsizing the office portfolio but as will said earlier we dont see loss content in that portfolio stepping back theres tangible nonsubjective asset quality metrics and then theres subjective tangible subjective grading metrics the tangible metrics past dues nonaccruals chargeoffs were all down for the quarter and then as we think about loan grading weve seen a lot of different approaches in the banks weve acquired over the years our approach is simple if a loan is below breakeven cash flow we graded substandard even if it has cash equity the guarantor got millions in liquidity theres no risk of loss but ill give you some specifics our largest loan as will mentioned in the fourth quarter they got added a substandard paid off at a substantial profit and then the largest one that added in the first quarter kind of getting back to your question about stressing it its a floating rate multifamily development loan in georgia i checked on it yesterday its reached occupancy but its got a ph debt service coverage because its a floating rate and its scheduled to go to the permanent market the fannie mae market in the fourth quarter and its going to cash flow fine because the exit rates about basis points less than the current floating rate so weve got detail in the deck that shows you our average debt service coverage ratios weve kind of gone in and looked quarterbyquarter at the rate reset risk over the next two years and weve got something in the deck that says were about or of our commercial real estate loans reset per year for the next two years so its southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 not a lot and as we stress those to the current rate theyre all still cash flow and in the low so we just dont see a lot of loss content there even though we may move the substandards up stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah extremely helpful color appreciate it john thanks for all the time this morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp you bet operator and we will take our next question from catherine mealor with kbw your line is open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a followup question so that on the moddys average have size of some of the substandard loans that increased i know your average loan sizes is very low and thats part of what we love about the risk in your portfolio but could you talk about some of the changes that we saw in office and multifamily and the substandard and are there any kind of larger credits within that or are those still there is it just kind of i guess is it a lot of smaller credits or are there kind of a couple of larger credits they were kind of speaking to some of the details that you just gave within that john john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah so the move catherine in the first quarter theres probably four or five loans that make up or of those the largest of which is that multifamily loan i mentioned thats at ph debt service coverage its going to be fine itll go to the permanent market in the fourth quarter theres a couple office loans in there one of them its a tenant remix story but its got a good guarantor good location we dont think theres loss on that theres one thats a in the million million range we might take a reserve on that of a couple of million dollars but that kind of gives you a flavor of the top three or four catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats helpful and then your comment will on so it was interesting you said if the borrower chose to move the loan from floating to fixed then there would be its basically the credit would be fine can you just kind of talk about that dynamic and what youre seeing in your borrowers appetite for that southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp sure will and john can fill in what i leave out i mean essentially with the inverted yield curve that presents an opportunity i just mentioned in my remarks that fixed rate loan would be at a lower rate but a lot of the borrowers who have plans to in many cases exit the property like the one that happened in the first quarter and they dont want to fixed the rate even though the debt service requirement will go down and some have plans to go to current market but maybe theyre not at the stage to be playing the game a little bit and think that rates may go down from here so maybe and finalizing stabilization period or early stabilization period so they cant yet go the permanent market all those kind of factors i think are in play there john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah and then maybe just add that obviously that nobody wants a prepayment penalty right before you sell it so that would probably be the other factor there catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc that makes sense okay thats great and still as youre seeing and youre looking at your classifieds today are there any that you look at that you made that may have that you think theres a high likelihood that they migrate from substandard into nonaccrual or is it more just this kind of rate dynamic thats driving all of it john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah when you dig into that substandard portfolio the past due portion of that catherine is only basis points so really this is not a payment issue this is not a collateral issue its really just a cash flow issue thats we think is temporary because of this rate phenomenon william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp its not catherine that we know for certain that our npas dont move up from here a little bit its hard to have a crystal ball in that regard but two things id say is one we our team digging through our portfolio still does not see material loss content and secondly as you know from following us but as we highlighted in the deck weve built our reserves proactively pretty significantly last couple years as well catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes for sure okay thats all really helpful i dont dig it on credit but just wanted to clarify a couple of the things and then the one thing on the margin i wanted to ask about in the higher for longer rate scenario that you kind of laid out steve do you think and its kind of amazing that you still think in that scenario the deposit costs are just kind of increasing by that basis point i think you said about basis points to basis points kind of a quarter and still the margin is able to stabilize can you just kind of talk about in a higher for longer rate scenario maybe where you think deposit costs peak out versus the mid range that you talked about if we start to get cuts in the back half of the year southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah i think you never can measure this by a month or even days but id say the general commentary that were seeing right now is that postjanuary maybe a little bit of february we did see a little bit of a deceleration in deposit costs now again theres been three two inflation reports and so the answer is i dont know but i do think what were seeing anyway is that deposit costs are moderate and youre seen that through the industry too and i think were seeing that so far but to your point if deposit costs are still or if the fed funds are still ph in december where our deposit costs be i think the way were thinking about it or modeling it is somewhere between basis points to basis points a quarter would be higher our loan yields are going to go up basis points to basis points somewhere in there and we would think margin would kind of hold in there because of those two factors but thats the crystal ball is not that great on the higher for longer thats kind of how were thinking about it catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah that makes sense all right great thank you indiscernible my questions operator and we will take our next question from michael rose with raymond james your line is open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp good morning michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe for good morning maybe just for steve just if we are in this higher for longer environment and understanding that you just kind of added a team to the correspondent business but just wanted to get your kind of updated expectations as it relates to kind of the fixed income and the swap piece and then the other components and how we should just be thinking about maybe that fee to average asset ratio which was kind of at the higher end of the guidance that you previously laid out thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah no michael were through the guidance as you mentioned so ill tell you that was a great quarter for fee income but much better than we expected to be honest with you to your mentioned our fee income was million or basis points which was higher than our guide of basis point to basis point in the first half of the year and as you mentioned we have two interest rate sensitive businesses primarily one being mortgage and one being correspondent so as i think what we mentioned before was we thought that noninterest income to average assets would be sort of in that basis point to basis point in the first half of the year until they cut rates and that would be basis point to basis point in the back half and then as we get into as they really start moving through rate cuts basis point to basis point southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 and the way i would characterize it id just say its been delayed a little bit so they dont cut rates until the third quarter i would kind of expect our noninterest income to average assets to sort of that basis point to basis point range and then as they cut rates thatll create some volatility and other things for both mortgage fixed income and our swap desk and that we think that towards the end of the year in that basis points to basis points and really our guidance for hasnt changed basis point to basis point which is the basis points to basis points is really what noninterest income to average assets so kind of a pathway of sort of benign were kind of at the lows of these businesses until we start seeing some rate movement and then itll move up basis point or so basis points and then from there as we really get down the rate cutting cycle wed see it kind of go up basis point to basis point which is a bit more normal michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats very helpful i appreciate it and then maybe just one for john i know its really hard to predict the economy but just wanted to get a sense for the competitive landscape and i know you guys are somewhat cautious always kind of have been and have a great world view but is the environment where people are starting to pull back is that creating opportunities for you guys with a bigger balance sheet versus a lot of the banks in your marketplace and just wanted to get a sense for borrower demand and your willingness to make loans at this point in the cycle thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah borrower demand is up michael we said in our prepared remarks the pipelines really shrunk after silicon valley last spring but in november they really started picking up so our pipelines are up about since november a little over billion most of it is ci its pretty broadbased its not cre related you think about the southeast clearly theres the net migration story but theres a lot to the manufacturing story in the southeast weve opened seven new auto plants in the last three years for electric vehicles and batteries and every one of those plants is thousands of new jobs generally speaking theres fewer supply chain issues than there were before the ports are not backed up at savannah and charleston like they were container shipping cost has come back down to a container but labor is still tight theres some slack maybe in white collar jobs but theres a considerable labor shortage still in construction and hospitality so overall it feels like the southeast is going to continue to grow and be able to work its way through these interest rate increases michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful maybe just finally for me it looks like you guys repurchased a little bit of common stock again this quarter your capital levels are pretty solid just any thoughts there just given where the stock is trading i understand your premium for most peers but just want to get a sense for what the thought process around the buyback thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah michael well i think our attitude remains one of a being opportunistic and being having the ability and flexibility to use that buyback authorization particularly if we see weakness when the window is open i think we also though value the optionality that we think we have from a strong capital and strong reserve position to allow southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 us to grow organically to execute other things with our capital so i think sitting here today we like the flexibility being able to do something with it but we also like the strong capital position were in and we think accreting capital probably continues to make sense for the michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc understood thanks for taking my questions operator and we will take our next question from brandon king with truist securities your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to followup on the comments around the acceleration in deposit costs i guess some acceleration in the quarter could you kind of describe where you saw that as far as what type of accounts what type of customers et cetera stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp hey brandon its steve i would call it a deceleration in deposit costs last quarter i think let me think through i think the second quarter shows that on page i think but in the second quarter excuse me the third quarter our deposit were up basis points i think the fourth quarter they were up basis points and then the fourth and the first quarter they were up basis points so its been coming down and i think in that as we look at the first quarter theres a bit of a remix and some seasonality i guess as i think about the deposit base sort of some of the pluses and minuses happening in the first quarter so the minuses first would be just around public funds typically theres some seasonality those typically have a little bit higher deposit cost and those ran down a couple of hundred million which is typical in the first quarter on the positive side we had really good growth and have over the last couple of quarters in our homeowners association business over million a team led by jarrod hurd and that team brings in a little bit lower cost of deposits or significantly lower cost of deposits with a lot of cash management business so i kind of look at it as theres a bit of a remix within that whole deposit piece but i wouldnt certainly wouldnt call it accelerating i would call it decelerating the general rule brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay i was referring to kind of i guess the pickup after the cpi reports that you alluded to southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp oh sorry no if i i may have been misunderstood i think what i was saying was that we did see during the quarter a deceleration of deposit costs but its hard to know as we continue to see these other cpi reports as we think in the second third and fourth quarter how that plays out but what we actually see on the ground is a little bit of deceleration and thats why our guide is kind of in that basis points to basis points of deposit costs versus last quarter but if we stay in the higher for longer how will that look in the third or fourth quarter i dont know that we know for sure brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay thanks for the clarity and i guess in regards to credit i recognize the movement in special mention substandard but not really affecting loss content but in your view how do you see the potential credit loss trajectory if kind of rate stay here for a while and even if longterm yields continue to rise higher john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp were trying to forecast and ask our credit team that same question and were trying to understand where the loss content might come from in a higher for longer so we remain the other day and steve asked our chief credit officer dan not the magnitude of losses but where would those losses come from the cycle and i thought his answer was insightful he thought that of it would probably be in the ci portfolio he thought that of whatever the potential losses would be would probably be in office and then the other would be in smaller sba and consumer kind of losses so interestingly he saw no loss content or very little to no loss content in multifamily retail or industrial so i thought that was an enlightening answer of kind of what his crystal ball was but you cant judge the magnitude of this right now it doesnt look like theres much magnitude at all but thats where he sees potential loss content brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah and just curious what sort of assumptions was he making with those comments as far as kind of john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah that would be probably in a i guess higher for longer means basically static kind of rate curve and if brandon its the fiveyear treasury and its kind of assuming the fiveyear treasury stays in that or less range if the fiveyear treasury moves to i think the industrys headed for more noticeable losses across the board particularly cre brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay very helpful thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp you bet southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 operator and we will take our next question from gary tenner with da davidson your line is open gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just wanted to ask a followup on the fee income side of things particularly in mortgage and correspondent banking given that you were at the top end of the range of this quarter what are you seeing in terms of maybe early second quarter activity in both areas and is the correspondent piece is the push out of lower rates or is that just keep the variation margin interest piece higher a little bit deeper into the year is that the biggest delta in terms of that line item john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah gary thats right i think as we think about correspondent were sort of near the bottom on sort of the gross income we think somewhere that million to million range over the next few quarters but youre right with the move up in longterm interest rate the variation margin gets to be a little higher so that moves move that ill call it contra income account up a few million dollars a quarter so and then we think as we think about mortgage the second quarter should be a good quarter but its a little too early to tell we definitely did have a spike up the first quarter so as we think about the entire picture and think about where noninterest income to average assets we just really think with all the things were looking at today we think its probably in that basis points to basis point range until we get some footing on the on whether we get rate cuts or when do we get the fixed income business of course right now with higher rates is a much challenging business and as we move our sba team up in houston that we just recruited over thatll help that but it takes a few quarters to get that up and move and but that really mostly a event gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you for that and then just one question on the construction piece obviously not much in the way of new commitments id assume in that business right now hence the kind of rolling over of the period end balances how much kind of planned exits are there in the construction side as you look over the remainder of the year john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah youre right gary i think our construction development portfolio decreased significantly down by like million roughly in the quarter and that was some of these projects just coming to completion but will as the unfunded piece of thats left to construction do you have that number william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah lets see unfunded piece is around billion and the biggest piece of that would be most down to the largest property type within that and then the second would be the owner constructed singlefamily residential so a loan to gary tenner to bill his custom house where hes the borrower not the builder thatll be the second biggest im going to just kind of bunch of different categories indiscernible southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp but the ratio of construction to capital gary dropped pretty significantly during the quarter below and we really dont see in the nearterm that moving up even with some of those fundings we sort of think theres payoffs along the way and it kind of drifts sideways roughly from here william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp yeah weve not been refilling that bucket and thats why youve seen that number come down it has the last couple of quarters as well as the reserve for unfunded commitments supporting as well as those amounts come down gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay but youre saying it sounds like youre saying that funding of existing commitments sort of offsets exits for the remainder of the year john c corbett a chief executive officer director southstate corp yeah gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co versus another step down william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer southstate corp thats what it looks like right now yeah gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you operator operator instructions and we will take our next question from dave bishop with hovde group your line is open david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning a quick question during the preamble i think it was well noted maybe the loan repricing on the fixed rate side could provide a tailwind just remind us what the i guess the dollar volume of repricing looks like over the next few quarters and what they might be pricing to and from thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer southstate corp southstate corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2024 yeah this is steve when we think about loan repricing basically its rough numbers of billion a quarter i think we have about billion left in and its repricing in that its ph coupon so our average loan yield this quarter was around so its not quite basis points but somewhere in that general range next year we have about billion at a ph coupon repricing in so its you kind of look at it over the next seven or so quarters its roughly billion if you add another billion or so in securities repricing over the next seven quarters or so thats kind of how to think about the next to get to the end of and so one of the questions i think it seems like sentiment has changed the higher for longer and what i wanted to do maybe before we close is just to think about a little bit around when rate cuts do happen and we dont know when theyre going to happen but sort of the pluses and minuses in our book the way were thinking about it and how were sort of guiding in that basis point to basis point margin expansion when that happens and it has to really do with our loan construct we have about billion of floating rate loans and if we get six rate cuts thatll cost us million we also have a billion deposit portfolio were sort of modeling a down beta on the way up on the way down so that would help us by million or so if we get to the end of next year we have six rate cuts but really the thing left that really sort of propels everything is the billion or so we just talked about that reprices somewhere in that to range above where we are today so lets call it thats million so you lose million on the floating you gain million on the deposits and then you gain another million on the fixed rate repricing thats million or so on a run rate on billion thats about a basis point improvement and thats sort of how we unpack the basis point to basis point as we think about rate cuts so i know everybody right now is thinking that were going to be higher for longer and certainly thats what the data telling us but to the extent the fed does pivot at some point thats how were thinking about sort of rates now david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc appreciate that thats great color and then final question i noticed just maybe a housekeeping a little bit of a tick up in shortterm cash and liquidity did that have anything to do with the
