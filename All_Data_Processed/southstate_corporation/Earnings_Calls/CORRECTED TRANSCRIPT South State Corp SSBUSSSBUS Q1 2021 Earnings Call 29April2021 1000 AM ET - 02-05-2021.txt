corp thank you will and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining us today the southstate team continues to make excellent progress in many areas and we are excited for the road ahead will be the year where many significant events come together for southstate the integration is on track vaccination speed and reopening of our markets are happening rapidly and the differentiation for what we bring to the market continues to grow is a year that sets us up well to focus on the future for our team our customers and our shareholders do challenges exist certainly they do but our team is focused in tackling these challenges very strategically and thoughtfully ill now turn the call over to john for more insight into the quarter john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp good morning i hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy each and every quarter over the past year the economic backdrop changed considerably with record levels of fiscal and monetary stimulus and a successful vaccine program it appears clear that the banking industry dodged a bullet and will avoid a prolonged credit cycle the industry and southstate in particular are equipped with enormous amounts of liquidity capital and loan loss reserves our balance sheet has never been stronger given these positive developments and four consecutive quarters with net chargeoffs of either zero or basis point we released million in loan loss reserves leaving us with ample reserves remaining of the reserve release coupled with another strong quarter in mortgage and correspondent banking and stable net interest income produced earnings per share of adjusting for merger expenses earnings per share came in at resulting in a return on assets of and a return on tangible common equity of with over million deposit account holders and the additional government stimulus our core deposits surged by in the quarter and our deposit cost fell to just basis points the result of the deposit surge is that we currently have over billion in excess cash to deploy on a positive note commercial and industrial loan balances increased for the third consecutive quarter but overall loan balances declined as the bulk of our residential loan production was directed to the secondary market after a year and a half of dreaming planning and working the integration of centerstate and southstate is almost complete several of the departments and lines of business have already merged together and the main system conversion will occur next month the shortterm tangible goal of the merger was to become more efficient in a revenue challenged environment but the longer term and the more important strategic goal was to create a new southeast regional bank that could successfully compete headtohead with the largest banks in the south who control about twothirds of the market share by combining centerstate and southstate weve created a billion regional bank in the most desirable markets in the country in the pandemic allowed families the freedom to choose where they wanted to live and work and population inmigration accelerated in the southeast of the cities in the united states with the most in migration of the top cities are core markets for southstate both orlando and tampa on the i4 corridor in florida and then atlanta greenville and charlotte on the i85 corridor south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 as further evidence that southstate is becoming the preferred alternative to the national banks we announced last week the addition of new commercial and middlemarket bankers that were recruited from the large banks during the quarter this follows recruiting success in the fourth quarter as well the quality of the bankers we are attracting has never been better our competitors appreciate the strength of southstates balance sheet our new technology and capital market solutions and most importantly the entrepreneurial culture that sets us apart our strategy is working as we emerge later this summer from the recession the pandemic and our systems conversion southstate is poised to generate significant growth and shareholder value in the years ahead ill now turn it over to will to walk you through the first quarter results william e matthews chief financial officer south state corp thanks john ill cover some highlights on margin noninterest income and noninterest expense as well as credit and the provision for credit losses lets begin by talking about nim net interest income for the quarter totaled million and comparing with  of remember that we had two fewer days in  costing us approximately million ill also note that we continue to operate with a significant cash in fed funds sold position ending the quarter at almost billion and averaging billion versus the  average balance of billion our net interest margin was for  down basis points from q4s on a core basis excluding accretion and the impact of ppp loans our nim of was down basis points from q4s if you normalized for the buildup in cash and fed funds sold in the quarter our reported nim wouldve improved about basis point versus  we began to see rates on new loans improved in the first quarter with first quarter new production weighted average coupons up basis points from  to we were still adding loans at rates below the portfolio yield but the difference improved from the fourth quarter our nonppp loan balances declined to million a annualized rate in the quarter with the decline concentrated in singlefamily residential loans and helocs down million slide in our presentation shows what weve done with our residential mortgage loan book in the last year as gain on sale margins expanded and longterm rates on mortgage loans declined our portfolio of adjustable rate loans shrank but our servicing book increased our total residential mortgage loans under management increased from billion to billion or while our residential loans on balance sheet declined by million and our servicing for others increased approximately billion as gainonsale margins and loan yields change arm rates are likely to become more attractive to borrowers and this portfolio trend is likely to reverse purchased credit deteriorated loans also declined by million during the quarter our ci loans grew by million offset by declines in consumer and construction and cre with our commercial pipeline building back up to approximately billion at quarter end we feel encouraged about growth improving in the back half of the year on the deposit side we continued to show incremental reduction in the cost of deposits down basis points to basis points for  and our total cost of funds improved by basis points deposit inflows continued to be significant growing billion in the quarter benefited by the most recent round of ppp lending and stimulus payments received by customers south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 with the continuation of record levels of onhand liquidity and the yield curve steepening in the quarter we took the opportunity to invest a small portion of our cash in the investment portfolio which grew by approximately million versus yearend we were careful not to deploy much cash into investments when we were at rate bottoms with much of our investments in the quarter coming in the month of february and march after rates backed up as you can see on slide investments moved up to of assets but were still below our fed funds sold balances which were at of assets we remain below peer in securities to assets and well above peer in cash to assets so we continue to have extensive dry powder giving us some leverage to additional earnings through deployment as well as to higher rates turning to noninterest income our noninterest income of million was down slightly from q4s million mortgage banking income was up million as noted on slide we produced billion in the quarter and we remain purchasefocused at of our volume again this quarter we did complete the integration on the one common mortgage loan origination system in midjanuary as wed expected our pipeline also improved after the loan origination system conversion growing to million this quarter up from million at yearend turning to slide correspondent income was up million with lower interest rate swap revenue in our capital markets business offset by higher fixed income revenue fixed income revenue grew due to better demand and the move in the yield curve and the addition of duncanwilliams for two months of the quarter added million of noninterest revenue were glad to have acquired duncanwilliams the fixed income business was strong this quarter and the outlook is good with the excess liquidity on bank balance sheets including those of the over correspondent banks we serve on noninterest expense total nie excluding mergerrelated expenses was million down approximately million from  duncanwilliams represented approximately million in nie a little over half of which was commissions for the two months it was in the company this quarter excluding duncanwilliams our nie was million we continue to be on schedule with our cost save realization with our late may conversion date well begin to see further expense savings in  and  at present we expect  nie to be in the million to million range this includes duncanwilliams for a full quarter and is after inflationary merit increases across the company beginning july however ill remind you of the expense variability inherent in commissionbased revenue our total mergerrelated expenses are still on track to be within our original modeling with approximately million remaining and most of that will occur in the second and third quarter of this year with some to trail in subsequent quarters ill now discuss credit with respect to cecl and the allowance significant improvement in economic projections impacting our loss drivers led to a meaningful reduction in the allowance for credit losses these improved economic forecasts caused us to record a negative provision for loan losses of million for this quarters weighting of moodys economic scenarios and our cecl modeling we rated baseline and the more pessimistic s3 scenarios equally versus the twothirds baseline onethird s3 weighting in  this quarters weighting reflects uncertainty in the economic forecast and vaccination penetration and success which uncertainty should lessen over time looking ahead as we obtain additional clarity and therefore confidence in the economic forecasts we would expect the weighting of the s3 scenario to reduce over time holding all other factors constant that would result in additional future reserve releases if that were to occur that would be incremental to any reserve releases caused south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 by improvements in the economic forecasts themselves its of course hard to predict the speed and the magnitude of such releases we are pleased that our actual losses have thus far been wellbelow modeled expectations but the nature of the pandemicdriven recession and the fiscal response are not captured in the historical data driving these models on that note as shown on slide we had another quarter of excellent loss results with a small net recovery our past dues criticized and classified assets remained low our npas declined for a third consecutive quarter and our referrals dropped below our ending reserve levels excluding ppp loans were or excluding the reserve for unfunded commitments still well above the approximately 115basispoint level at cecl adoption turning to capital with a negative provision expense and higher net income we formed capital at a higher rate this quarter with a rotce if the negative provision were removed our rotce would have been almost on a balance sheet with a very strong cet1 ratio over ending tangible book value per share grew to up from  compared with a year ago which was the last quarter prior to our moe closing tangible book value per share is up over which is growth in a year of a pandemic and a significant merger as noted in the release well be calling million and sub debt when the call window opens in june additionally we will be in this quarter some older trust preferred securities we inherited in various acquisitions these trups have a weighted average cost slightly above and a fair value mark of approximately million that will be accelerated in  the payback of this hit to earnings will be around four to five years our strong capital position provides us with several opportunities for deployment whether on organic growth capital returns to shareholders fintech investments line of business acquisitions or traditional ma with that ill turn it back to you john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right thank you will between the merger cecl adoption and ppp there are a lot of moving parts for you to analyze were firm believers however that the simplest test of performance is the growth of tangible book value per share over time as will said were pleased to have grown tangible book value per share by during a challenging year ill now turn the call back to the operator so we can open the line for questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jennifer demba with truist please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning a good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc question the thoughts on growing the securities book further while were waiting for loan demand to improve i know rates are up so its a little more attractive now but what are your thoughts on growing the securities book more over the short term steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp yes jennifer its steve we have a couple slides in the deck that ill point you to page in our earnings deck kind of describes the buildup of liquidity over the past five quarters of the combined company and just a couple of comments there before i answer your question you can see that right before we announced our merger in january we had about billion of investable assets and the 10year treasury was sitting at if you fast forward to today we have billion of investable assets and the 10year treasury as it went through the trial is now back to the range so i think your question is a timely question as we manage the securities book over the last year remember when we put the two banks together ph we have to have these the fair market value accounting in the second quarter when the 10year was at its lowest level and so we sold off a portion of the old centerstate securities just to wait until there was a better time to reinvest so i think were really glad that we did that and were strategic in that so if you look at our portfolio today our portfolio is around billion and we have about billion of excess cash over what we normally show page shows where our peers are and our peers as a percentage of the investmentsassets are around to but were only at so as we look forward over the next several quarters we would like to get somewhere in the to of assets range and just average it in over time knowing that rates continue to change and continue to move and we want to be longterm focused but we also have as we understand more liquidity than we had originally thought and you can see that in that graph so that to of assets is roughly another between billion billion of securities as we think and well continue to look at that every quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you ph i have one followup on asset quality your loan losses have been incredibly low recently and over the longer term can you just talk about what you think the right range of net chargeoffs is that we should see for southstate over a cycle it looks like im guessing these losses have come in much better than you have guessed john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey jennifer its john the level of chargeoffs naturally is going to change in a cyclical business depending upon where we are in the cycle i think if you look back at the history of centerstate and southstate youll see a consistency that both companies have been in the top quartile as it relates to chargeoffs and i do not see our underwriting standards changing i would anticipate that to be the case going forward as well jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you operator the next question is from michael rose with raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions will i just wanted to get a sense for where we stand in terms of the cost savings that youve realized i think it was million how much of that has been realized and obviously i understand your comments on the core expense base i think you said million to million for the second quarter but it does seem like on the fee side with duncan and williams and kind of strong activity in some of those fee lines of business even mortgages you talked about pipelines being up might you expect those expenses to maybe be a little bit higher thanks william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp sure michael maybe ill start by sort of giving you a reconcile if you will so second quarter of last year the quarter we announced or the quarter we merged our noninterest expense was million million so of our million cost save estimate thatd be million a quarter and within that ph million or million a quarter is really an offset in the noninterest income line related to our debit card contracts that we negotiated so it flows through up there as opposed to an nie so if we took that million million drop of million now which is about million thats before the addition of duncanwilliams which as you saw in this quarter their two months nie were about million thats of course going to vary with the revenue and they had a good revenue quarter as they are likely to have in this environment with the interest rates and liquidity where they are south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 and then also we have in july will be annual merit increases for our staff which is more an inflationary type thats about million per quarter so just reconciling that fact that million million minus million gets you to about the million million you indiscernible merit increases gets you to say million and then duncanwilliams indiscernible what their quarter looks like is somewhere in that range of million to million for the fourth quarter well have a little bit more in cost save recognition in the second and third quarter that gets you down to million to million and maybe it could be on the low end of that if commissions revenue is not as high on the higher end if its much better than our net interest income michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate the reconciliation there and maybe just on the margin front obviously a lot of moving pieces with ppp and the paa but if we exclude both those items would you expect the margin the kind of core margin come down just given the securities purchases that you made what appear to be later in the quarter and then future securities purchases and just repricing lower of loan yields as we move forward thanks steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp sure michael its steve and let me just take you through a couple of thoughts as we work through it so page in our deck we talk about our core deposit franchise and i just think its important to highlight that particularly as rates continue to move and they certainly are moving higher thats going to be the really key for a longterm success relative to our margin but if you look at our core deposits of them are in dda of them are in checking accounts and when you look at the graph to our peers versus our peers at that really should outperform in a higher rate environment so as we think about the long term thats where we think theres a ton of value to get directly to your question on page we show our core margin accretion over the last several quarters and just the things i would point out to you there in core margin dollars which is really what were focused on primarily just because of a growth in the balance sheet but youll see in the first quarter it was million with two fewer days in the fourth quarter if you normalize the number of days for the fourth quarter that core margin or the core dollars would have been dead flat and so as we think about the rest of the year were flattening off this quarter next quarter in core margin dollars and then as we think about deploying the cash into securities and cash indiscernible more importantly into loans over the next to months thats going to provide some tailwind to the core margin dollars so hopefully that gives you the framework to help you model michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc it does thank you very much steve and then maybe just finally for me just on the ma front i know we got systems conversion coming up you guys are going to build capital here pretty nicely especially if you do have some more reserve releases when the ppp comes off what would the combined organization now be looking for in a transaction maybe both in terms of size and markets i assume would be in your expanded footprint but would just love any color there thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 yeah michael its john i think weve been pretty consistent in our communication that is all about getting the foundation in place for the future so weve been very internally focused on getting this moe done right and i believe we are as we get past the conversion in the second quarter we think about the future theres a whole lot more clarity now about the economy and to your point we are generating a fair amount of capital so the way we look at it michael is we just want to be positioned to be opportunistic in deploying that capital so we think in our markets with the way the economy is coming back theres going to be strong organic growth opportunities we do think theres going to be ma opportunities and our preference would be to expand in the markets that were currently already in and then theres also opportunities we believe to invest in ourselves through buybacks so i think weve got all three options on the menu and so well just have to see quarterby quarter whats the best option for our company michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great i appreciate you taking all my questions operator the next question is from stephen scouten with piper sandler please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone a ph good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i was just kind of curious maybe if you could talk to the kind of expected pace of new hires from here assuming those expectations have been already built into kind of that expense guidance but just wondering what you see as the opportunity set as you look to continue to drive growth john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah thanks stephen weve had good success in the fourth quarter and the first quarter in hiring i mentioned we hired new middle market and commercial bankers in the first quarter and wouldnt be surprised if that doesnt continue in the to per quarter range for the next two or three quarters theres just a lot of disruption with some of the biggest banks in our market and look for that to continue fortunately weve been able to continue to add and have not expanded the expense base greatly so i dont know if its going to be a big needle mover in terms of expense but id love to see us continue at the current pace were at to stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then john as you mentioned you guys are in some of the best markets in the country from an inmigration perspective so i dont know that new markets are necessarily on the radar but wondering if youre considering team liftouts or otherwise to expand into any new msas across the footprint south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp its not a high focus right now stephen part of the rationale of southstate and centerstate coming together is the sixstate footprint that were currently in so you think about whats going on in atlanta greenville charlotte orlando tampa theres plenty of opportunities in the markets were in weve got some scale in those markets but would love to continue to have greater density in those markets and were really going to focus on hiring efforts in those markets stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great perfect well thanks for the color appreciate it guys operator the next question is from catherine mealor with kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wanted just to circle back maybe first on the expense conversation will and wanted to clarify about mortgage expenses that you have mortgage commissions are net in fees and so a decline in mortgage revenue perhaps wont necessarily result in a big change in the expense base is that the correct way to think about that william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp yeah i mean as you and i have talked before we do net identifiable costs associated with the mortgage production against revenue produced ph properly we think but we do have the fixed income business for example is one that has commission base the same is true with our arc business those are both commissionbased business lines as well and so if the fixed income demand changes thats going to change the commission expense base there catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay so more kind of thinking about the fixed income ph bend and mortgage that makes sense okay and then how about on loan growth i know that loans declined a little bit this quarter it seems like youre optimistic about growth to improve in the back half of the year john are you still kind of thinking about a low to midsingledigit growth rate or do you think that could be even better in the back half of the year particularly just given the kind of population growth and economic trends youre seeing in some of your markets south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah catherine i met with the board yesterday and i told them that i feel like were operating an eightcylinder engine thats been fired on about six cylinders because of the pandemic the conversion the moe once we get the conversion behind us in the second quarter i really feel like were going to be back to running on all eight cylinders were encouraged to see in the last three quarters consecutive growth in ci although total commercial has been somewhat flat the main headwind for loan growth has really been in the residential mortgage and heloc area not because of a lack of volume we did billion in residential last quarter we just felt like it was a better use of capital to direct those loans to the secondary market where we had recordhigh gain on sales and low longterm rate thats changing now and as rates start to move up its more likely that were going to pull more of those arm loans onto the balance sheet but looking ahead once we get past the conversion in the second quarter our expectations in the second half of the year are for loan growth to return back to midsingledigit growth you think about the companies historically have been to growers through the cycle were going to put more residential on the loan portfolio in the second half weve had all these new hires that are building their pipeline and theyre going to start putting that production on the books in the second half and theres been a lot of construction lending in the first half of the year that will fund up in the second half of the year so you think about the future of the second half of this year you go into the economys reopening consumers and businesses we believe are going to start spending their cash and we think that loan growth could really accelerate from here catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats very helpful thank you operator the next question is from kevin fitzsimmons with da davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hi kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co just obviously its been a long road with the moe and the markets and the size and scale had been an obvious benefit from this so not to get ahead of ourselves here because youre still buttoning up this one but when you come away from this deal looking at the scale you have now because that weve seen a lot of merger activity and it seems like its all about scale its all about spreading these it investments out over a broader asset base so how do you feel about the size scale you have now for going forward and get john given what you said south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 about all the growth opportunity you have in your footprint or would you ever entertain doing something like this again with the thought that hey if increased scale was this beneficial its even more beneficial to be that much bigger or is that just really out of the realm of possibilities thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah let me take it a step back and if i think through the last decade i think it was very critical that we built the company the way we did to build the scale that we have today in the markets that were in now having said that i dont feel like theres the same urgency in the next decade to have to grow through ma the way we felt that urgency in the last decade i think where were positioned now were just positioned in the indiscernible we can grow organically there are ma opportunities theres opportunities to invest in our own stock so i dont feel the urgency that we felt in the last decade but we do feel like there will be opportunities its just not necessary for us to compete anymore with the big banks we can compete today with the platform that we built kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co great thank you and just a quick followup will you mentioned during your prepared comments the acl ratio and i just want to make sure im thinking about that correctly so is that where were at exppp about today and that can come down day one was about is that what you said just want to make sure william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp yeah yeah kevin and keep in mind the two companies were not combined when we both adopted cecl so thats an approximation i mean i guess the way to think about it is we are at levels well above where we were when we adopted cecl the economy changed a lot over the last year were still about indiscernible in the economic forecasts that we had an appropriately conservative economic forecast mix in our provision model this quarter but if theres a lot of ifs there but if one were to assume that the economy were to return back to the levels it was when the industry adopted cecl absent other changes in portfolios and whatnot its reasonable to expect that the industry would return back to levels about where it was when it adopted cecl on an allowance perspective and were still well north of that kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co great and i would just assume given the uncertainties you talked about you would go out of your way to maybe make that a more measured return as opposed to a fast return william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp i dont want to indiscernible were managing because thats not what were doing but there is enough uncertainty in the economic picture and thats changing now if you look at the forecast changes from  to   to  theyre very large magnitude in a short period of time and the models are ph trained on an economic scenario thats really unlike any unlike what we experience today and a fiscal response something like that south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 so were being thoughtful about that and making sure that we do see greater clarity but it looks like everyday things do seem to be improving so well have more information as time goes on and hope it will allow us to feel more comfortable as the economy really is getting back where we like it to be kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay there have been a few questions about bank ma but taking a step back looking at like the duncan williams deal are there businesses that you would really be interested in doing kind of business line or fee incomerelated acquisitions like that as they become available steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp yeah kevin this is steve were always on the lookout for those things that would bolt on to businesses we understand and i think for us duncanwilliams was a great complement to both our correspondent business and our fixed income business that gave us several hundred more clients so now we have over new client banks which just gives us more products to sell more clients to talk to we would also look for wealth management opportunities things that were already in but from a standpoint of deploying capital thats just one of the levers were always looking for kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co okay thanks guys operator the next question is from brody preston with stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone a good morning a good morning brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey i just wanted to start on fees particularly on mortgage the pipelines up here and gain on sale was up from levels and so i guess im just maybe just ph starting to understand a little bit why it was pretty flattish quarteroverquarter steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 sure brody we referenced page in our deck and ill maybe i can just take that and give you kind of the overall picture we went through our systems conversion in january and remember we intentionally slowed down the pipeline in december in order to get that accomplished and thats exactly what happened our pipeline went down to million at the end of the fourth quarter and grew up to million so significant growth in the pipeline production this quarter was billion if you go back a year ago the same quarter just to take some of the seasonality it was about billion so its up so again the production is really working there and as you think about the comment around secondary versus portfolio we had about twothirds of our production was sold and then about a third of it was portfolio lending and a lot of that portfolio lending was construction that will fund up over time as we go through this change of rates were very were continuing to be bullish on the actual production just because we do the last quarter purchase but as we think about the mix it might be and well just have to see that we get a little bit more into the portfolio and a little less with secondary so as you look at the seesaw between noninterest income and loan growth thats the thing youve got to look at and for us were just trying to produce at the level where weve been producing at and were pretty bullish about that but from a standpoint of where that production goes i would think that over the next several quarters we might see a little bit more in the portfolio and a little less to the secondary if i had to guess brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay got it and i guess just then as i think about the fee guidance that you gave last quarter i think youve guided down about from that ph combined level for the year but with mortgage presumably getting tougher for everybody throughout the year and it sounds like youre going to portfolio a little bit more of it could you maybe help me better understand how youre going to get to that that call it i think its like ph or so to how you get there via other fee income lines steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp sure brody i mean i guess you take this quarter and annualize it thats probably a little higher than that ph its probably closer to ph number for the year but the way we think about it and the way weve always thought about it is we want to make sure that our target our goal is to have of our fee income to average assets and of course weve had a lot of bloating in the average assets over the last quarter we had about billion worth of growth but if you look at that during normal times thats where we want to be where we think that between service charges between correspondent between mortgage all of those things average out around and in times when its volatile and rates are moving all over the place youll see our percentage noninterest income to average asset be much higher and i think last year we probably hit somewhere between and but in a more normal environment we would look to see that number to manage towards a over a long period of time brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood and then just on the margin i wanted to ask im sorry if i missed what you said earlier what new origination yields were for the loan portfolio south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp yeah brody they were and thats coupon only in the first quarter and thats up basis points from q4s brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood so when i back out the ppp the paa the core loan yield was down about basis points or so in this quarter and so i just wanted to get a sense for what you thought the quarterly rate of compression on the loan yield would be moving forward at core number steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah brody this is steve to your point our loan yield exppp exaccretion is right around i think it might be so we did have basis points or basis points of compression and i would expect that probably to continue until we get the equilibrium between loan yield and loan production and thats where the and the excess cash just as you all think about modeling maybe from a longerterm perspective john mentioned this in his opening comments but we have this billion of excess liquidity thats sitting on our balance sheet more than we would normally use and as we think about the deployment of that excess liquidity we already spoke about the securities that we would move that up over time closer to peer levels maybe billion and then by the end of maybe theres a couple of billion dollars that weve deployed in loans and so that leaves us still billion to billion worth of just dry powder that gives us the ability to if some of the deposits shrink a little bit or we have faster loan growth that we can deploy so thats kind of how were thinking kind of medium to long term about this excess liquidity brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood that and to that point just with the capital youre building the excess liquidity you have i can appreciate what youre doing in the second quarter with some of the sub debt and the trups redemptions i just wanted to maybe better understand when can you call the rest of the sub debt and i guess whats stopping you from just taking down the whole just because its costing you about million a quarter william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp yeah so the sub debt issues in general and the biggest one that we did last year yeah its not callable for five years from issuance and then once you so within five years of maturity 10year maturity 5year noncall the capital treatment begins to amortize radically within five years of maturity thats when you generally want to call sub debt just because you start to lose the capital treatment so the million ph fees i referenced is one that we inherited in the ph incom acquisition that was issued back in the others are smaller pieces i mean we got a handful of them that were inherent in acquisitions that really werent issued as sub debt but were actually issued as trust preferreds but they have tier capital treatment given our size and they were marked at the fair value at purchase in our june fair value marks and those were yielding north of so we took the ones that looked to be the obvious ones where the paybacks seem south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 reasonable to go ahead and wipe those out this quarter but the others like the large piece sub debt it will be it was issued last year in may so may of so five years from there would be our call date there brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay got it and then just on the capital front i hear you on the bank ma but john you have mentioned investing in southstate and buying back stock and so i know you got the new authorization from last quarter and so i wanted to ask i know the multiple is higher than sum but it sounds like you think it should be even higher from here so i guess when should we expect you to start buying back stock john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah we think the stock is attractive buy where it is today so as we get more clarity about the economy more clarity about tax code look for us to be more bullish on ourselves and well have to evaluate that every quarter with other opportunities but were feeling much more bullish about investing in ourselves than we have when there was less clarity brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay got it and then just on the loan growth the pipeline was up to billion i heard you say on the commercial front and thats up from billion last quarters call and so it sounds like thats up nicely what should we expect from a pullthrough rate on that im just trying to better understand when we should expect to see cre growth return and ci growth pickup from this quarters run rate john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah so the pullthrough rate the last two or three quarters has been about and it fluctuates naturally up and down from there so weve been seeing commercial loan this is commercial loanonly production in the billion billion range so as the pipeline grows were up to billion its likely that well see a third or more of that convert to commercial loan production in the second quarter the variable here thats uncontrollable is payoffs and we have had some payoffs in april but we think that pipeline continues to grow as the economy reopens and with that pullthrough rate we think we could easily see midsingle digits in the back half of the year brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right and then last one for me i heard the duncanwilliams expense number did you guys give a revenue number for what they did this quarter william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp yes their noninterest revenue for the quarter was million brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 okay great so that mix of the million versus million on the expenses to revenues ph is that kind of ratio remained consistent william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp well its like any business where you have some component of fixed expenses and some component of variables so that as revenue moves up the percentage of expenses will go down and then conversely the opposite is true ph its been down a little over half of that million was commissioned though so that helps you ph get a flavor brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right thank you william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp sure operator the next question is from christopher marinac with fig partners please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst fig partners llc hey thanks good morning steve answered one of my questions just about the percentage of assets on the fee income side but if we kind of take that another step steven or john and look at the spread relative to average assets youre roughly i think basis points as you put the liquidity to work does that spread naturally rise or is there an issue with just having overall margins and spreads getting wider to kind of affect that im just trying to break down the pretax roa and kind of where its going to go over time steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp sure chris this is steve i think as it relates to the margin its really difficult because of all the excess liquidity at the end of the first quarter our average earnings are indiscernible interest earning assets were significantly higher than the average earning assets for the quarter because all the liquidity piled in in february and march so i would expect this from a margin perspective for the actual percentage to go down from this past quarter just because we ended up with such an influx in liquidity toward the end of the quarter but what youll see over time is that margin will bottomout and as we deploy the cash and the loans and we deploy the cash into securities assuming that rates dont fall from here theyll start gradually increasing from that level so i would expect that as we continue to do that toward the end of the year you would start seeing that inflecting in the third quarter fourth quarter and hopefully as it goes into at a higher level christopher marinac q analyst fig partners llc okay great and then back to the fees we know the volatility in the mortgage business over time but do you think the capital markets business will be as volatile or do you think youll be able to manage that to where its more steady maybe more wealth managementlike in terms of the returns and just building that over time south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp sure page weve put in the deck this time that showed sort of where the revenue came from and its kind of interesting to look at on the top right graph it shows the difference between sort of our what we call our arc revenues our interest rate swap revenues and our fixed income revenues and you can see in it was much more weighted towards our interest rate swap revenues and that was because of the shape of the yield curve was flat and its low what you saw in the first quarter was the curve got steeper and so our arc revenue fell a little bit just because its not as advantageous to hedge but because all the liquidity it really the fixed income revenue went up and so the way i kind of think about that business just particularly because weve been talking about it is theres been a massive liquidity put into the banking system and a lot of deposit growth were seeing this not only for ourselves our peers but also for our correspondent banks so as you think over the next two years whats going to happen to that liquidity either were going to loan it or theyre going to invest it and so for us i think were positioned well in the correspondent bank to help them do both when they invest it well do it on the fixed income revenue side and when they loan it therell be certain amount of hedging that we do for our clients as they continue the loan growth because they already have the deposit growth christopher marinac q analyst fig partners llc no thats helpful steve and i appreciate disclosure on so thanks for walking through that steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp sure operator the next question is a followup from brody preston with stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc john one last one just on the efficiency ratio if you kind of back out purchase accounting accretion and ppp from the efficiency ratio it was maybe this quarter i think on the mid audio gap as we think about ppp going away and maybe in as the paa continues to wind down how do you get that sort of efficiency ratio once you get past the core conversion how do you get that trending back more closer to audio gap steven dean young q chief strategy officer south state corp brody this is steve ill follow up with just a portion of the ppp before i turn it over to will on that efficiency piece i think you all caught this from the release but just from a more technical perspective theres million worth of ppp accretion left in the book we think that rough number of that will come in this year depending on the forgiveness but thats kind of how were thinking about it and then well get the remainder so thatll maybe help you in your modeling south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 29apr2021 and then also on the on the loan accretion just because you mentioned it in the release we have million of that left in the release but as we think about efficiency ratio weve always thought about it in terms of core and so much of this is driven by the yield curve i mean we just talked about it as we continue to grow core net interest income that efficiency ratio will naturally fall its really a revenue issue more than it is expense issue william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corp yeah id also say the same thing brody to me the efficiency ratio story is much more about our revenue and obviously weve got billion on our balance sheet that earned basis points last quarter and doing something with that will do far more for our efficiency ratio going forward operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to john corbett for any closing remarks john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right well thank
