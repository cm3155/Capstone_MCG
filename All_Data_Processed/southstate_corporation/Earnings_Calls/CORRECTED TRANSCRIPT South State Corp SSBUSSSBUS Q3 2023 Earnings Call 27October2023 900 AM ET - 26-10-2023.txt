south state corp thank you will good morning everybody thanks for joining us in the earnings release last night you can see that south state delivered a solid quarter that was right in line with our previous guidance will can cover the details but high level we continue to see steady growth in loans and customer deposits liquidity is stable capital ratios are growing deposit funding is bestinclass and our net interest margin is settling in at a pretty good spot one of the core values that we continually preach to our team is to keep our eye on the longterm horizon so we spend a lot of time talking about the big picture talking about the economic cycle and where we have risk and where we have advantages the stages of a banking cycle are simple and predictable the cycle risks move from liquidity then to earnings then to credit and then finally to capital but while the stages are easy to predict predicting the speed and the severity of the cycle thats the tough part since march weve clearly moved through the first phase the liquidity tightening phase as deposits left the banking system for money market funds now the predictable and necessary response is that the industry trades away future earnings power as deposit costs rise now for south state our granular deposit base has served as a ballast for our franchises and weve been able to continue to grow our deposits with a cumulative deposit beta of only and a total cost of deposits of for the quarter over on the asset side were also about to benefit from a tailwind of loan repricing of our loans are based on a fixed or adjustable rate so were going to see a significant portion of our loan portfolio repriced by more than basis points as they renew and that should help offset any additional drift in deposit costs now it feels like the velocity of change for deposits is moderating and were now shifting to the credit risk portion of the cycle in the last year weve set aside million in reserves with only million in chargeoffs and as a result we built our reserves up by basis points to now the cycle is more severe than many are predicting those reserves plus our excess capital will allow south state to be opportunistic on the back side of the cycle where the opportunities to create shareholder value are the greatest so were cautious now the lag effects of the rapid rise in rates are only just beginning to work their way through the system but at the same time were excited we think that there is a tremendous opportunity on the horizon for a bank of our size in our geography and with our deposit franchise so i want to close by thanking our team for keeping their eye on a longterm horizon and building a franchise that can weather the storm and come out stronger on the other side ill pass it back to will now to provide some color on the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you john we had another solid quarter with deposit costs margin and noninterest income ending up in line with our expectations solid ppnr and good credit costs outside of the one sizable chargeoff that impacted us and some of our peers ill touch on a few details before we move on to qa on the balance sheet our annualized loan growth moderated from the first half of the year in line with our expectation deposits grew at a annualized rate or if you exclude the approximately million in brokerage cd maturities we allowed to run off without replacing south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 though we continue to see a mix shift in our deposits from dda and the money market accounts the pace of the dda shift moderated a bit this quarter dda is represented of total deposits at quarter end down from last quarter and as we mentioned previously this figure was to before the pandemic so it continues to appear as if were moving towards those prepandemic levels for dda as a percentage of deposits turning to the income statement our nim was down basis points from  loan yields were up basis points but deposits were up basis points which was in line with our basis point to basis point guidance bringing our cycle to date deposit beta to our net interest income of million was down million from  on one more day noninterest income of million was down million from  though still a solid quarter correspondent revenue was million after million in interest expense on swap collateral for million in gross revenue down approximately million from  wealth had another solid quarter but mortgage revenue of million was down million from  we had another good quarter in deposit fees similar to  expenses came in a bit lower than expected this quarter largely due to a revaluation of serp retirement plan liabilities due to higher interest rates reducing nie by million we also made a million donation during the quarter for which we received a dollarfordollar tax credit so nie was higher by million in the quarter and income tax was lower by the same amount excluding that nie was in line with our expectations looking ahead we expect nie for  in the mid range subject to normal variations in expense categories impacted by noninterest income and performance with respect to credit we recognized the million in net chargeoffs in the quarter bringing our yeartodate total to million or basis points annualized yearto date the one sizable snc loan chargeoff that received a lot of attention earlier in the quarter accounted for all of the low net chargeoffs as we experienced net loan recoveries before overdraft losses absent that credit both for the quarter and yeartodate we continue to build loan loss reserves with a million provision bringing the total reserve to basis points of loans for overall asset quality trends npas were down slightly past dues were flat substandard loans increased and special mention loans declined line utilization continues to be flat except on construction lines as were not originating many new construction loans and existing projects move towards completion we continue to have very strong capital ratios with ce tier one of or if aoci were included in the calculation tce ended the quarter at with loan growth expectations continuing to moderate riskweighted assets growth should be in a range that allows us to continue to grow our regulatory capital ratios and provide us with flexibility operator well now take questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well go first to stephen scouten at piper sandler stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone i was curious if you could talk a little bit about what youre expecting on the nim side moving forward and deposit trends from a cost perspective and obviously its catching up a little bit but still extremely strong so just kind of wondering what youre expecting in the months ahead stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure stephen this is steve we as you know page shows kind of a summary of our nim over the last four quarters and you can see a this this past quarter which was within our guidance and our deposit costs were up basis points this past quarter which was in the basis points to basis points guided so we so far have sort of been where we thought we were as we look forward our guidance is really around three things interest earning assets the rate forecast and deposit beta and really our interestearning assets are well pretty flat i would expect going into the fourth quarter as we think about moodys consensus forecast the only change it really forecast no new rate hikes but then it has four cuts starting in the late second quarter and for the fed funds rate to end at at the end of and so with all that our deposit beta the third component page shows our cycle todate deposit beta is we continue to expect a high total beta by the end of the year so with that we would expect deposit costs to increase basis points to basis points in the fourth quarter and so with all of that kind of all those assumptions baked together wed expect nim to bottom in the fourth quarter somewhere in the basis points lower maybe around to somewhere in there so thats sort of what were looking for in the fourth quarter as we look into based on the moodys forecast and our growth assumptions wed expect our interestearning assets to average billion and that our net nim would stabilized in the to range which is really no change to our guidance if i take a step back and thinking about versus its been such a volatile year relative to rates and nims and other majors and so on but it looks like our nim for the full year will be in the low and is in the mid3 and well just have a little bit more growth to offset it so anyway those are kind of the ways were thinking about nim one quarter out and sort of how were thinking about it for next year with these assumptions stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thats helpful and the stability thats created there and i know john spoke this a little bit is that a lot of that coming from the asset side repricing on that of loans and have you guys given any detail around the pace of those repricings and kind of when we can kind of ratably see that benefit stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 sure i think last quarter we talked about it on the call but its roughly about billion a quarter in loan repricing so whether billion a year and that step up is around basis points or so and then of course we have some securities coming in and thats probably million or million but well likely use that to fund loan growth so maybe that helps you kind of just frame up its about billion a quarter over the next i dont know five six quarters and its roughly at basis points to pick up and the yields are somewhere in the ph to range william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and thats the adjustable and fixed repricings stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it right yeah understood okay great and then i guess lastly for me any sort of as you think about that moodys expectation and we start thinking about presumably some rate cuts any kind of higharching balance sheet strategies to protect the nim when rates presumably do go down and anything around the a potential bond restructuring i think the aocls maybe near million here today so im just kind of wondering with the capital build if thats something you guys are thinking more about stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp maybe ill just you know nim strategy is maybe will or john can address capital and boundary structure as we think about the nim moving forward we had an investor recently asked us if fed funds went down to what was your nim back when fed funds were and we did some i think rarely to remember but we look back at it and it was in the to range so its just were waiting for the repricing strategy of all these fixed rate type loans if our deposit is paying in and so as we think about well do things around the margin around hedging and those kinds of things that wont be a huge strategy for us but i think the opportunity will be as rates if rates do fall if we have four rate cuts next year the money markets and those types of things on an incremental margin would fall a little bit and then our fixed rate repricing of our loans would continue to reprice up and so as we think about the modeling and as we think about nim thats why we sort of are guiding in that range but why dont i turn it over to will and just maybe talk about bond restructuring capital william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah yeah stephen good morning id say we have flexibility which we like weve got a strong capital position weve got a strong reserve weve got a good capital formation rate and as they give us a lot of things to think about with respect to capital deployment i mean at current price our stocks pretty attractive so certainly repurchases of some degree is on the table and additionally with bond portfolio restructure while were not likely to engage in a wholesale kitchen sink type thing theres certainly the ability to nibble around the edges so we continue to think about all those options as well as some of the growth opportunities afforded to us by turmoil in our markets and the good economy in which we operate so we like that flexibility stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co fantastic thanks for all the color projector everyone appreciate the time south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp thanks stephen operator well take our next question from catherine mealor at kbw catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc with these couple of smaller ma transactions in the southeast over the past few months just curious your updated thoughts on ma and how youre thinking about how your positioned there come into next year john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey catherine its john good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp we have really no change yeah no change from our prior guidance weve seen a couple of these deals happen but its still really really challenging to get the math to work with the aoci and the regulatory delay risk so our assumption is that things are going to pick up probably the back half of as we get closer to the election and theres more certainty in the economy clearly the logic is there for ma given the revenue pressures in the industry and were just going to stay out on the street visiting peer banks that possibly could be partners in the future but its challenging in the short run catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then just kind of bigpicture earnings question as we think about next year as you look at youve got a little bit lets call it stabilization in the margin after we kind of come off a fourth quarter it seems like you still expect for there to be a little bit of balance sheet growth but as you look at revenue growth as compared to expense south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 growth how do you think those two marry each other in do you think this is a year where you can still create positive operating leverage or do you see this as a year where well really kind of see revenue and expense growth kind of be at the same pace or maybe even a little bit more expense growth relative to revenue just curious how youre thinking about that into next year stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp well catherine this is steve if you can tell us what the yield curve would look like thatd help im not sure that we know that but i do think in the immediate environment as we think about weve talked about nim if we talk about fee income thats going to be a bit more challenging i think in the next quarter or so just with the 10year treasury rising up one of the businesses that indiscernible correspondent division and we see with the 10year rising some of the swap opportunities probably arent there at least in this quarter and it bounces around from time to time and so on so id imagine that will eventually come up but our range of noninterest income to assets i think that if you look back at this quarter we guided to basis points to basis points this quarter we were at basis points so id call that the high end if i looked forward into the next quarter i would think wed be closer to the lower end of that and then as we think about kind of a fullyear picture of noninterest income i would expect i think weve been guiding in that basis points to basis point range well probably end up in the low basis pings to average assets and as we think about id expect we would probably start a little lower and then in the higher as the if the moodys consensus is right and the 10year treasury goes back towards well start seeing more capital market activity so kind of the way i think about it probably wont be a lot of growth in the noninterest income yearoveryear assuming the moodys rate forecast and i would expect that based on the nim forecast we just kind of went through dollar growth its probably not going to be ph a less so thats the revenue picture indiscernible just talk through the expense picture william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and so obviously with that revenue picture our goal for next year is to be very controlled in our expense growth and were still deep in the planning and budgeting processes as most people are at this point and the state they dont have any precise guidance to give but we would hope and expect to be in the low to mid singledigit range on expense growth and try to control as tightly as we can catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great all right thank you appreciate it john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp all right thanks catherine operator well go next to michael rose at raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions just wanted to follow up on that last point on expenses you guys are in a pretty enviable position from a fundamental standpoint you guys have been very conservative built reserves i think thats really well taken from my vantage point youve got capitals growing i mean why not be more aggressive on the expense side now while revenues are under pressure so you better positioned yourself as you talked about john at the outset for what will be brighter days at some point i know theres a lot of dislocations in the market i assume theres a lot of good lenders out there that you guys can go after why not actually be more aggressive here on the hiring and organic growth front while you have many competitors that are capital and liquidityconstrained thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah okay when i heard you say be aggressive on the expense front i wasnt sure whether you were cutting expenses or adding expenses michael but i think youre saying be opportunistic is what youre saying michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc correct yeah yeah yeah john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp and yeah we would agree with that and i would tell you that really were opportunistic all the time we never stop recruiting and building the bench strength i think about our management associate program weve had going for years where we bring in college interns every summer we convert to into management associates every year to build that bench strength on the credit team and on the lending team were always out recruiting last night my wife and i had dinner with a prospect a veteran prospect banker and so were out talking to folks all the time and so were not going to put a number out there on the expense gross side that would keep us from being opportunistic if that helps michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc got it it now makes complete sense just a few smaller ones i noticed that the fhlb was just essentially paid down looks like brokered deposits came down a little bit what other i assume broker deposits will come down as your grow core deposits whats kind of the right level to think about that and is there any other tools or actions you can take on the liability side to kind of contain the creeping interest bearing liability costs thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah michael its steve youll remember in march when we had sort of the banking turmoil we went ahead and did a brokerage offering i think it was a billion or so and then we also borrowed million of federal home loan bank and that was just sort of an abundance of caution with all the turmoil going on and what youve seen over the last couple of quarters is one weve paid off the million of federal home loan bank as worries have died down and then the broker cds are starting to roll off so we typically right now i think our brokered cds around of our deposits give or take i could see that coming down a little bit but i wouldnt it wouldnt be an abnormal level for us to be around of broker deposits it could go lower but it wouldnt be an unusual on that for us to stay hang out in that general range south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and i would say and echoing comments that i think some of our peers have made in their calls were seeing the while theres still deposit cost pressure the rate of change is slow to bit and the it feels like the heaviest competition in that regard is behind us michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great maybe just finally for me do you have a sense for what the new loan production yield was and maybe what the margin was at the for september thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yes so our new loan production yield for the third quarter was around i think its a little over that on the new funded yield it is a little higher than that in september i dont think we have the september margin numbers but i think it was for the most of the quarter it was not all that far different from our ending quarter but a few basis points here or there and the margin moves obviously a few basis points on days versus and so on but it was reasonably stable most of the quarter michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks for taking my questions guys john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thanks mike william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks operator well move next to dave bishop at hovde group david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc curious circling back to the preamble you mentioned sort of the life cycle of the banking industry and paying attention to the credit cycle here we saw that the oneoff snc credit you alluded to in the chargeoff but maybe south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 peeling back the onion just curious your recent reviews of borrower financials anything thats standing out from a credit deterioration perspective that maybe not be not showing up in the numbers but areas where youre pulling back from are being a little bit more cautious on these days john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah i mean dave the pipelines are trending down i mean i think the fed is getting what they wanted with liquidity being tight i think borrowers are more cautious banks are more cautious so we anticipate for the industry that pipelines will shrink now the interesting part is i think the loan growth will be a little bit disconnected from the pipeline trends while pipeline trends will be going down and probably new loan production will be going down payoffs have screeched to a halt and theres still some funding that the loan production that we did the last couple of years so i think that were going to see probably midsingle digit kind of loan growth continue but it will be on lower production levels than weve had in the past but like from a credit standpoint weve talked about in the past the areas that that we see having the most stress in the shortterm is probably small business sba kind of loans the assisted living space just never really recovered from covid and they continue to face labor pressures and yeah everybodys talking about office we think were going in and our loan review team is being very conservative and forwardlooking on how were looking at grading loans and so i think its forcing the conversations with borrowers in advance of maturities which is the way it should work so anyway that gives you some picture of our sense of where the credit risks are and where the production trends are headed david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc great appreciate the color operator and well go next to brody preston at ubs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys how are you this morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp were doing well brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey i just wanted to clarify something on the expenses real quick will did you say you said mid is that accurate south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah its in the mid the exact middle point of that would be million thats the mid i was referencing sorry i wasnt more clear brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc no no no i just want to make sure because the live transfer picked up mid which william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp oh god indiscernible william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and let me also clarify i should point out that it does not include of course the fdic special assessment which has not if it gets finalized this quarter well all be booking up in  and for us thats around million but thats not in those numbers obviously brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay on the portfolio restructure you said that youre not going to do the whole kitchen sink maybe a nibble around the edges i guess what does nibbling around the edges look like in terms of size and i guess maybe the securities that are coming due more near term that maybe have lower loss content to them like are there is there a size of a portion of the portfolio thats maybe loweryielding thats maybe coming due at some point in the next months that you could look to punt on that could generate some reasonable eps accretion stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp sure brody this is steve as we thought about it and continue to monitor and think about it i think the as were thinking about like size i dont think it would be certainly not more than probably or so the available excuse me of the investment portfolio book that would be something to look at and then i guess as we think about eps accretion to earn back all that would be anything else we do on the capital side we would want that earnback to come within three years so i think as we think about the whole options on the table relative to capital whether as will mentioned the buyback whether its bond restructure whether its growth whether its ma were thinking about them inside the same lens of course on a bond restructure you have less execution risk but at the same time theres other pieces and parts that were looking at from a capital management and im really glad that were in a position where capital has grown over the last year the earnings the ppnr earnings have been really good and the loan loss provisions have been socked away so i think were in a good position to have some flexibility brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 got it okay i appreciate that and then on the buyback im just trying to think about willingness to be maybe more aggressive just given where the share price is it wasnt that long ago i think it was last year you bought back some pretty decent slug of stock were pretty well below it were pretty well below where that was and so just given the capital generation and the stock price today i guess what would you think would be the right level of buybacks to think about moving forward stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah look theres no gun to our head to do anything immediately but the stock price we think is attractive and we are generating capital so stock buybacks or day by day thing when youre looking at the economy and youre looking at credit potential risk but right now the price looks pretty attractive to us i dont think if the time and the cycle to do any kind of wholesale major move but back to nibbling around the edges it looks okay where it is brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay i think you gave this snc portfolio percentage in the deck i think i thought it was like do you happen to have what the of that what you guys are lead on stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey brody just not a meaningful part of what we do at of our portfolio but we typically did not lead typically when were in these credits these are credits that follow middle market bankers that weve hired from bank of america wells and truist so in many cases the banker that works for us used to lead the credit but because were trying to manage hold limits normally were just taking a piece of the credit so i think out of relationships we only lead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then i just want to clarify im sorry if i missed this earlier in the call but just on the swap revenue i think you guys have been pretty clear that you should expect correspondent to have some kind of ups and down up and down quarters here with the swap income is this more of the level that you would expect in the current interest rate environment going forward stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah brody this is steve it does bounce around a lot and you can see that in the quarterly numbers a lot of times in the correspond division well have other things that offset it but just to frame that up on page of our deck is our noninterest income kind of trend in the last i dont know i guess its five quarters and you can kind of see it our noninterest income to asset sort of bounces around its been as high as basis points its been low as basis point of assets so as the 10year treasury from june to call it now the 10year treasury is not quite up to close that has an effect on our capital markets team at least in the short run the pipelines until everybody kind of gets used to it so i would expect like i said that our noninterest income to assets this next quarter would still be in basis point would be closer down to the lower end of the guide basis points weve been guiding basis point to basis point theyd be in the short and a little bit lower and then as we think about next year and you look at the moodys consensus it looks like the 10year treasury starts coming down towards toward the end of next south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 year my sense would be that those quarters would get more favorable towards that particular division and we kind of rebound so yeah kind of looks it will get a little lumpy from quartertoquarter sometimes but from a standpoint of looking at the overall picture that would be how id look at it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and maybe for john just to followup on catherines question on the ma onb bought capstar or announced theyre buying capstar last night and it seemed like a pretty reasonable wellpriced deal some solid accretion and the stock is actually mildly outperforming today which is nice to see so when you kind of see investors may be happier about a wellpriced acquisition that doesnt come with too much dilution does that maybe make you think about wanting to do something sooner rather than later despite the current rate environment john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp i mean its a case bycase basis brody so were open for business and if the right opportunity came along sooner rather than later we would pursue it i think its just going to be few and far between over the next couple quarters anythings possible so i wouldnt rule it out i just think if i was forecasting i think i think activity for the industry is going to be more robust second half of but were not opposed to it if something attractive and accretive to our franchise came along brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then just my last one we talked about this i think on the first quarter call and i know again its a very small loan portfolio for you guys but im more interested in it just from a commentary perspective than i am necessarily ph a sales base specific perspective but the substandard indiscernible portion of the nursing home portfolio keeps going up is there anything different than what we talked about last time which i think was costs keep going up maybe some of the thirdparty payers arent paying out as much im just trying to think is there anything kind of unique to senior housing right now thats kind of driving some of that weakness because youre seeing it elsewhere at other banks as well john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah i talk to our credit team specifically about that but as you point out its less than of our loan portfolio but really it comes down to the labor i think thats the biggest issue right now probably labor the nursing shortage you hear about some of the rates that traveling nurses get and then interest costs going up and so youve got two major expense headwinds and then you still go the revenue headwinds following covid about peoples desire to be in a nursing home post covid but the main issue brody is the nursing shortage and the labor costs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc awesome thank you very much for the color i appreciate it guys have a good rest of the day john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2023 all right william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you
