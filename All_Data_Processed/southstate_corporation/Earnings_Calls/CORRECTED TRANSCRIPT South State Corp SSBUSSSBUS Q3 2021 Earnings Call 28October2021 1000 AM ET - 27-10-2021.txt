state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 now i will turn the call over to robert hill executive chairman robert r hill jr executive chairman south state corp good morning and thank you for your interest in southstate we are pleased to report our performance for the third quarter the performance was solid and the team made nice progress in each of our three areas of focus soundness profitability and growth we knew going into that this would be a year of significant change for the company building the foundation for a larger bank which included new technology and talent these are difficult changes and take time to digest but this year has positioned us well for the future as an investor its hard to see the benefits in the shortterm of an moe but the third quarter was a quarter that provided a glimpse into the future opportunities for southstate just as was a year of change will be a year of focusing on ourselves the internal opportunities for growth efficiency advancing talent technology and building our culture are real and meaningful we have great markets a strong and growing team and so many opportunities to make our company better we look forward to reporting to you the progress we make in these areas over the next year ill now turn the call over to john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thank you robert good morning everybody i hope you and your families are doing well throughout the pandemic weve talked about the population migration to the southeast the rapid reopening of our markets and our growing loan pipelines not surprising loan production increased significantly last spring following the vaccine rollout and that trend continued in the third quarter in fact loan production of billion in the third quarter is a record for us and is higher than a year ago our previous guidance was for midsingledigit loan growth in the second half of this year and we exceeded that guidance in the third quarter with annualized loan growth most of the growth was in ci loans which has been the trend over the last few quarters a portion of the ci loan growth this quarter was associated with seasonal businesses that support hurricane cleanup efforts for large power companies so some of this quarters growth is seasonal and temporary our cash position at of our balance sheet is materially higher than our peers and were working to deploy that excess cash as interest rates drift upwards securities increased by over million last quarter and loans increased by million excluding ppp so we deployed about billion of our surplus cash into earning assets the growth of loans and rising rates resulted in our core net interest income growing by million in the quarter we were encouraged by the feds commentary a few weeks ago about tapering their asset purchases and we believe that southstate is in a unique position to benefit from rising rates over the next year asset quality continues to be a nonevent with net chargeoffs of basis points during the quarter as a result we released million in reserves after the reserve release our adjusted earnings per share landed at and our return on tangible common equity was doug is here with us and will comment later in the call on another strong quarter at atlantic capital they had loan growth i do want to report that we received regulatory approval for the acquisition from the occ and we are now awaiting federal reserve approval the shareholder vote is scheduled for november so were hopeful for a close in the first quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 we originally thought there was a chance we could convert the computer systems in the first quarter but it looks more likely in the second quarter so that will push back the cost savings by about days weve accomplished a lot strategically in the last two years with the moe in and the opportunity with atlantic capital in as we look ahead it only makes sense that will be a year that we are internally focused rather than focused on bank ma were going to be focused on continuing our recruiting and our organic loan growth refining our processes and new technology and improving our profitability as we saw in this quarters results loan growth with an improvement in the expense base and a little lift in interest rates can have a powerful compounding effect in the quarters ahead ill turn it over to will now to provide further details on the quarter william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks john ill cover some highlights on margin noninterest income and noninterest expense as well as credit and the provision for credit losses as shown on slide net interest income for the quarter totaled million core net interest income excluding all accretion including ppp accretion improved by million from  million of which was due to an additional day account and the remainder of which was due to stronger net interest income per day our loan growth and continued improvement in deposit funding costs helped improve our core net interest income our net interest margin was for  flat with  loan yields of were up slightly from  but loan yields excluding ppp loans were down basis points to new loan yields in  were down basis points from  as a reminder and as illustrated on slide the average 10year treasury yield was down basis points in  versus  overall cost of funds declined basis points to basis points core loan growth excluding ppp loans was million our ci loans grew by million followed by owner occupied cre at million and construction which includes consumer construction perm mortgages at million single family residential excluding construction perm loans declined by million in the quarter our commercial pipeline remains strong at billion at quarter end as youll note on slide we had another good quarter of loan production on the deposit side our cost of total deposits declined basis points to basis points and total deposits grew over million after a million reduction in cds we continue to deploy some of the excess cash into both loan growth and securities with securities growing by million versus  balances as you can see on slide investments moved to of assets and our fed fund sole balances were of assets and we remain below peers and securities to assets and well above peers in cash to assets so we continue to have extensive dry powder additionally youll note our asset sensitive profile and low historical deposit beta illustrated on slide and turning to noninterest income noninterest income of million was up million from  as highlighted on slide mortgage banking income improved by million from last quarters million but remains well below last years record third quarter production was billion with purchase loan representing of total volume we sold of our volume in the secondary market down from  after last years record margins gain on sale margins have returned to levels more consistent with historical levels with a slight improvement from  south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 turning to slide correspondent income was million down slightly from q2s million deposit fee income also increased million some of which is attributable to fee waivers last quarter associated with our core system conversion our noninterest expense total nie excluding merger related expenses was million down approximately million from  in spite of a loss on the sale of a piece of acquired ore due to a zoning issue and higher health insurance expenses due to claims activity  also reflects a full quarter of merit increases which were effective july also as john referenced weve refined our conversion date for atlantic capital and is now expected to occur in the second quarter of rather than  so with respect to nie and modeling this will slightly push back much of our cost stabilization by a few months ill now discuss credit with respect to cecl and the allowance improvements and economic projections impacting our loss drivers led to another reduction in the allowance for credit losses these improved economic forecasts cause us to record a negative provision for loan losses of million for this quarters weightings of moodys economic scenarios in our cecl modeling we reviewed the underlying assumptions in the moodys baseline and s3 scenarios and decided to move to a slightly more conservative weighting than  with baseline at and s3 at versus twothirds onethird last quarter on that note as shown on slide we had another quarter of excellent loss results with less than in net chargeoffs this brings our five quarter cumulative net chargeoffs to basis points or an average of basis point per quarter our past dues npas criticized and classified assets remain low our ending reserves excluding ppp loans are shown on slide and were basis points or basis points including the reserve unfunded commitments the million and remaining unrecognized discount on acquired loans represents another basis points turning to capital with the pending atlantic capital merger and safe harbor limitations our repurchase activity was more muted during the quarter after announcement with total repurchases of  in  and an additional  in early october were out of the market until the atlantic capital shareholder meeting which is scheduled for november even with the increase in loan growth and repurchase activity our capital ratios remained strong with a leverage ratio of cet1 of and total riskbased capital at tbv per share ended the quarter at up over the last year ill now turn it over to doug to give a few highlights on atlantic capitals quarter douglas l williams president chief executive officer director atlantic capital thank you will and good morning im pleased to have this opportunity to share atlantic capitals third quarter results with you as you know we filed our earnings release and investor presentation last night and those are available on our website first id like to thank my atlantic capital teammates for another great quarter despite the added work of merger integration planning and related distractions they remain focused on helping our clients pursue opportunities and meet challenges while the economic recovery slowed during the quarter due to the delta variant surge and there are uncertainties about the effect of fiscal and monetary policies on the course of the economy our clients are performing well and continue to make investments for the future those investments are driving our new business pipelines and resulting loan growth with strong growth in loans deposits and revenue atlantic capital recorded another quarter of solid operating results as we reported atlantic capital earned per diluted share for the third quarter of compared to for the second quarter and per diluted share in the third quarter of last year preprovision net revenue was million a annualized increase from the second quarter and an increase of compared to the third quarter of loans held for investment excluding ppp loans grew annualized from the second quarter of and south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 yearoveryear loan origination volume was strong across all our banking teams and net loan growth was

categories have grown at a compound average growth rate credit quality is excellent there were no net chargeoffs during the quarter nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets was at quarter end and criticized and classified loans decreased as youve seen we recorded a negative provision of million for the quarter the allowance for credit losses excluding ppp loans was at quarter end with

ahead to the fourth quarter and to ph our new business pipelines are robust and we expect continued strong momentum and loan deposit and revenue growth pat oakes and i will be available to answer your questions during the qa portion of our call this morning now back to john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thanks doug so were encouraged with the healthy loan growth in the quarter our progress on expense savings and growth in core net interest income and with the strength of atlantic capitals results in a rising interest rate backdrop were feeling good about our momentum as we head into operator lets open the line for questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from jennifer demba of truist jennifer over to you jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc congratulations on a very good quarter do you think your pipeline and your business momentum right now could mean better than midsingle digit loan growth continuing over the near term john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah jennifer there is a slide we put in the deck on page which i think is very illustrative of whats going on through the pandemic and the rising loan production that weve experienced this quarter with loan production originations of billion thats up from last quarter and its up from a year ago and from a net growth standpoint its the highest net loan growth weve had at million if you go back twoandahalf years its more than double the net loan growth dollars that weve experienced part of this is seasonal basis that we had we did some business with some companies that do hurricane cleanup for power companies and that was a part of the growth this quarter our pipelines are growing into october but at the same time were continuing to see sales of some operating companies and some sales of some cre properties with these low cap rates so i think our guidance jennifer originally it was midsingle digits for the back half of this year we wound up at for the third quarter as i look ahead into the fourth quarter maybe because of some of these seasonal businesses as well as some of these indiscernible we might be low to mid single digit growth in the fourth quarter but i think our trajectory as we head into is going to look like mid to upper single digits which i think is the guidance weve given previously so i think were on track mid to upper single digits in jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay and can you quantify how much of that loan production in the third quarter was from that more hurricane related lending john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 yeah its about a third of the net loan growth thats business that we have some clients that do work for large power companies in the northeast and the gulf coast states that come in after the hurricane so that business typically increases in the third quarter its flat in the fourth and you see some of it come down in the first and second quarter of the following year so its about a third of the overall growth jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay my last question is on asset quality your losses have been extraordinarily low whats your outlook for the couple of years do you think they can stay really low maybe not quite this low but really low john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp i think historically if you look at the asset quality metrics of our company dougs at chargeoffs southstate centerstate all very conservative underwriters relative to peer groups and the metrics if you go back through the cycle right now jennifer were sitting on a tremendous amount of cash on the sidelines with our banks but also with our consumer and commercial customers so i would think that at least in the short to intermediate time period in the next year or so well continue to see good asset quality metrics as long as theres so much cash in our clients balance sheets jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you operator thank you jennifer well now be moving over to brody preston of stephens brody over to you brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp morning brody preston q analyst stephens inc i wanted to just real quick just on the seasonal the hurricane commercial relationship so in terms of modeling should we expect that this kind of similar i think you said it was about a third of the overall ci growth so thats about million to million or so should i expect that level of seasonality in the third quarter every year going forward south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp this is like predicting the weather so our clients this year had client relationships where storms landed so it might be a little bit outsized this year than it would be in the future but its a business we like a lot the counterparty on the other end of the repayment is these large publicly traded power companies so this year i think its a little more outsized just because of where the hurricanes landed brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it okay okay maybe just on the mortgage business could you tell me what the size of the servicing portfolio was at the end of the quarter i think it was billion at june just in terms of the size of the loans that youre servicing steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey brody steve i dont have the number in front of me but its pretty close to that number it might be closer to billion and we did grow it a little bit over the quarter but yes somewhere in that general vicinity brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay okay thank you and the last couple of quarters youve ratcheted down the amount of production youve sold into the secondary market from like or so closer to like just thinking about the puts and the takes between your expectations around growth on the commercial side and then the residential production should we expect the secondary percentage to kind of remain in the range going forward or should we expect it to move back up to the range william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah brody i would think its probably somewhere in between i would think its probably closer to i think whats going to happen if you look at the ph nba forecast for next year the refinance index is supposed to be considerably down which doesnt bother us very much because of our business is ph purchased but what that will do on our portfolio loans likely is itll just allow for less refinance there and so just the natural evolution of loan growth in our own portfolio itll just stick longer because we wont have as much prepayments but obviously as we think about the economics of whether to sell a loan or whether to keep a loan it has to do with the gain on sale margins it has to do with what our liquidity positions are there are several things but i think is probably a good modeling thats how were modeling brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay thank you for that just on the balance sheet the securities growth thinking about the yields that you put on this quarter where they whats the indiscernible of the portfolio and what are your current plans for securities growth here in the fourth quarter steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 yeah brody steve again we had a slide in there i think its page which just describes sort of the growth in our securities book and also sort of the position and our cash position so at the end of the third quarter we had billion in cash and billion securities book as you mentioned it did grow million i think we mentioned on the call our best forecast was were going to grow at million or so a quarter what happened of course in the end of the september we had saw a nice rate increase and so took advantage of some of that toward the end of the quarter as we think about that portfolio and as you all model relative to us and atlantic capital combined today were around little less than of investment assets i think for us as we look at it as a combined company on a billion balance sheet were somewhere between and is the way i would kind of model it maybe or so and then were just going to see what the yield curve does from here theres so much uncertainty but i think weve gotten to a position we feel a lot more comfortable with than where we were a few quarters where we were more like or of that william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp and brody its will ill just add that that assumes that we dont have unexpected additional deposit growth i think the industry received more liquidity coming into deposits this year than many of us expected so its hard to predict but based on what we see today thats our expectation steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp and if you look at that and kind of play that out to the end of next year with atlantic capital and with indiscernible flat deposit rates and with our loan growth the way john mentioned it were still going to have billion of cash sitting on the balance sheet so i think were going to have plenty of flexibility to do whatever is necessary when the time comes brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it okay and i just have a couple more here on the origination side on the loans what are new origination yields coming on that a lot other companies have bemoaned how competitive it is and so i just wanted to get a sense from you where thats hanging out john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah brody i think will mentioned in his remarks i think its this quarter was the new production and part of this is of course the duration of what the lending youre doing and were trying to be prudent there relative to swapping some larger deals and sometimes that shows up in the yield day one and doesnt show up over a period of time depending on what libor or sofr does so our yield was with the ph pack up and rates i would expect particularly the five year treasuries backed up probably basis points or basis points i would expect those new production yield would start moving back up towards brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then last one just on the provision you all took another bps or so out of the reserve ratio this quarter could you just refresh me real quick i thought it was for the day one combined was indiscernible south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 southstate and is that still a good level to think about from a normalized provisioning perspective going forward william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah brody its will its a hard question to answer so i think that is a reasonable forecast but the complexity you have with cecl being adopted when it was and then the unprecedented government reaction that has occurred and then the leading to a recession where people didnt have credit losses is going to impact the statistical historical correlation between recessionary type economic metrics and loss drivers and resulting losses so itll be an interesting issue for the whole industry to tackle when youre going to have a dataset come into that historical data thats going to be abnormal at best so yeah i think thats a reasonable way to model but i just want to clarify that its a tough modeling proposition based on the fact that weve been through a period with really no losses in spite of a recession brody preston q analyst stephens inc understood thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you brody operator thank you brody were now moving on to catherine mealor of kbw catherine please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc indiscernible question on expenses you saw nice reduction in expenses this quarter just given we had the cost savings fully coming in but weve seen from really most of your peers that have reported so far an increase in expenses just given wage inflation and higher technology costs and all the things so update us on some of your thoughts on expense growth from here and what you think a kind of fair run rate is for maybe once weve got acbis cost savings fully in there south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp sure catherine we still expect in the shorter term  to be what we had had projected before there are always a few things that move one way or another that are hard to predict this quarter we had some things with health insurance claims for example were selfinsured but generally we think that that range of million to million that we expressed before us is about right for the fourth quarter so similar to  looking ahead were still completing our budgeting process the guidance that we have given to the team is that we need to and expect to be in the low single digits in terms of our expense growth for next year and as weve said with atlantic capital we expect to save roughly a third of their expense base thats about million on an annualized basis or million a quarter with us doing the conversion late  youll start to see that in  and itll show up more in  for them having said all that of course we are in the same competitive market everyone else is for labor and all that but were working hard to try to keep our expense growth down to that low single digit range catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and i think you mentioned earlier that the acbi conversion you think as late  have you changed when you believe you will close the deal william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp no we have not as you noted there are two remaining things we need to achieve to be able to close one the shareholder vote which is scheduled for november and then secondly receive federal reserve approval weve received occ approval so we have no reason to believe that our currently planned january closing would be beyond that but its out of our control catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great okay thank you so much john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you catherine william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you operator thank you catherine were now moving over to stephen scouten of piper sandler stephen please proceed with your question stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey good morning william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co just to follow up will on your comment there did i hear you say that correctly that you guys do need dc fed approval on the deal and i know we just i think there was one two days ago that maybe got dc fed approval but im sure theres another deal kind of in your markets thats been delayed so i guess have you gotten any insights on what that timeline might be i know you said you dont have any reason to believe its changed but just anecdotally what youre hearing from people john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey stephen its john we got occ approval rather rapidly as will said the shareholder vote is set so weve heard nothing concerning at all from the federal reserve but we do know that theyve got a lot on their plate right now so i think the balls in their court and so were optimistic and havent heard any reason why there would be delays but thats in washington stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay fair enough and then john you mentioned kind of for the strategic focus is really more on indiscernible acbi organic growth continued new hires and you all put out some pretty impressive press releases around the new talent youve been able to add im just wondering if you can frame that up in some way kind of if you have numbers on how many lenders youve added over the last months or kind of what your total pool of lenders are or what percentage increase anything like that that would kind of frame up just how big an opportunity thats been on the hiring front john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah we added we did a press release we added nine bankers in the third quarter and the trend is very similar they typically to 30year veterans coming out of the largest banks in the metro markets typically they are longterm middle market bankers commercial bankers and treasury specialists so weve just got a unique opportunity here with the company that we built that has both an entrepreneurial culture as well as the scale to compete with the largest banks that its become a very very attractive platform for us so i look for that pace to continue i think in the last months i think its been in the neighborhood of to a quarter so bankers a year that were looking to add and were real encouraged with the platform weve got and the attraction that it has for these bigger bankers stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 okay very helpful maybe just last thing for me i know atlantic capital had a recent press release talking about their expanded selfrelationship and im just wondering i dont know if dougs still available if theres any commentary there of just understanding what that expanded relationship means and what it could mean for the pro forma company any increases to kind of expectation since the deal was announced douglas l williams a president chief executive officer director atlantic capital stephen the press release that youre referring to talked about that we are beginning to issue secured credit cards for self and i think as of the close of the quarter we have several thousand cards outstanding now with an average balance of maybe a couple hundred dollars and again these are secured cards so this is another avenue of loan growth under the self program we have the credit builder account these are the secured installment cd secured installment loans that have an average balance in the several hundred dollar range and now were adding the credit card secured credit cards where average balances maybe in a couple of hundred dollar range and we expect this to grow rapidly over the next few quarters earlier this year we had a million guidance limit for self weve increased that to million to accommodate anticipated growth so i think youll see growth accelerate over the next few quarters from self stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect thats really helpful thanks for all the color guys and congrats on a great quarter john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you stephen operator thank you stephen operator instructions our next question is from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott christopher please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thank you maam i guess if we stick with doug for a second these really strong deposit growth as well as the cash thats still outstanding in atlantic capital is any of that temporary doug or is that still kind of a permanent part of your indiscernible douglas l williams a president chief executive officer director atlantic capital theres some seasonality as you know chris we typically build balances in the last two quarters of the year but thats going to stick around it did the last year and i dont see any significant moves to withdraw liquidity from the system in terms of monetary policy and so forth so it is organic i think it will stick around there are some seasonality there related to the ach processing business for payroll companies but i think well see most of that hang around john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah chris i would focus on the average not that period end balance south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 douglas l williams a president chief executive officer director atlantic capital yeah john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp because that period end balance is inflated with the payroll business we have thursday is a big number for us so quarter ended on a thursday so that does inflate the balance douglas l williams a president chief executive officer director atlantic capital but again on an average basis we had linked quarter annualized growth in deposits and we had growth yearoveryear so strong midteens percentage average growth in the past so i think its a trend thats sustainable christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for that and back to the southstate side i just want to ask more about the correspondent banking business both on the arc opportunities in the next couple of quarters as well as any new products that you envision in the future steven dean young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey chris that business has really performed pretty steadily this year if you think about the opportunity there all the banking system has excess deposits that they have to do one or two things they either have to loan it or invest it and so just like we have all this excess liquidity so do our clients thousand clients and so i would think the shape of the yield curve is going to matter there so as the yield curve gets steeper well do more fixed income as the yield curve gets flatter well do more swap income on loans even in the last couple of days youve seen the interest rate curve flatten my guess is indiscernible pick up some but anyway i think what were trying to do is build out some ill call it little specialties within some of those fixed income and arc products i dont think theyre huge needle movers relative to the income but youll just continue to see i think really solid performance out of that group its a great business million plus of revenue business so its done really done really well and been pretty steady christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great steve thanks for that and just last question perhaps for will is the fixed rate lending in the portfolio i think is do you envision that changing much as and come into focus particularly post the merger william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah chris indiscernible thats been a pretty consistent number for us over time and ill remind you too the fixed rate lending we do with the exception of some portfolio mortgages generally are going to be in that five year sort of range and so theres sort of a constant amortization of that rolling through and thats an important part of our asset sensitivity but i think its even more important i guess is that core funding ph basin weve got a slide in the deck that shows our deposit cost over the last cycle beginning back in thats on slide south state corp ssb corrected transcript  earnings call 28oct2021 of the deck if you are going to take a look at that but i think thats really more of the asset sensitivity story than in fact the loan repricing but to answer your question directly no i dont see that changing really significantly from where it is today john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp and chris id add we did have indiscernible page and i just think its worth when you have time to look at for probably everyone on the call because i do think it illustrates the rising rate interest rate sensitivity we have and so much of it is tied to our deposit base and it really illustrates the importance of our deposits and what we did on this slide on page was we went back to the last rate cycle starting in the fourth quarter of all the way to the end of the rate cycle second quarter of and we plotted three things we plotted our combined deposit cost which is the bottom line middle line is the fed funds rate and the top line is the five year treasury which is where we do a lot of our lending and commercial lending and others and what it shows is our combined deposit beta was only but i probably direct you to second quarter of in the second quarter the fed funds rate was only but our deposit beta was only at the date the five year treasury was and our combined bank traded at more than times tangible book the secret to this franchise is the rising rate and the deposit lag in the book so anyway just wanted to back to interest rate sensitivity we try to put that slide in just to give you some history of the combined company where we think the future earnings power is if we get a low yield curve ph out christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc no i appreciate that thats great disclosure thanks for highlighting that graph operator okay as that was our final question thank you christopher ill hand back to the management team for any final remarks john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp all right melissa thank you and thank you all for joining us this morning we appreciate your coverage of southstate as always if you have any questions on your modeling dont hesitate to reach out to will and steve and hope you have a great day and as we sit here with doug and pat indiscernible operator this concludes todays
