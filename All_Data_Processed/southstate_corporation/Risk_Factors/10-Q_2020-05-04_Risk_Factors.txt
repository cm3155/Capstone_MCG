highly uncertain and will be impacted by the scope and duration of the pandemic and actions taken by governmental authorities in response to the pandemic the ongoing covid19 global and national health emergency has caused significant disruption in the international and united states economies and financial markets and has had an adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations the spread of covid19 has caused illness quarantines cancellation of events and travel business and school shutdowns reduction in business activity and financial transactions supply chain interruptions and overall economic and financial market instability in response to the covid19 pandemic the governments of the states in which we have financial center and of most other states have taken preventative or protective actions such as imposing restrictions on travel and business operations advising or requiring individuals to limit or forego their time outside of their homes and ordering temporary closures of businesses that have been deemed to be nonessential these restrictions and other consequences of the pandemic have resulted in significant adverse effects for many different types of businesses including among others those in the travel hospitality and food and beverage industries and have resulted in a significant number of layoffs and furloughs of employees nationwide and in the regions in which we operate the ultimate effects of the covid19 pandemic on the broader economy and the markets that we serve are not known nor is the ultimate length of the restrictions described above and any accompanying effects moreover the federal reserve has taken action to lower the federal funds rate which may negatively affect our interest income and therefore earnings financial condition and results of operation additional impacts of the covid19 pandemic on our business could be widespread and material and may include or exacerbate among other consequences the following employees contracting covid19 reductions in our operating effectiveness as our employees work from home a work stoppage forced quarantine or other interruption of our business unavailability of key personnel necessary to conduct our business activities effects on key employees including operational management personnel and those charged with preparing monitoring and evaluating our financial reporting and internal controls sustained closures of our branch lobbies or the offices of our customers declines in demand for loans and other banking services and products reduced consumer spending due to both job losses and other effects attributable to the covid19 pandemic unprecedented volatility in united states financial markets volatile performance of our investment securities portfolio decline in the credit quality of our loan portfolio owing to the effects of the covid19 pandemic in the markets we serve leading to a need to increase our allowance for credit losses declines in value of collateral for loans including real estate collateral declines in the net worth and liquidity of borrowers and loan guarantors impairing their ability to honor commitments to us and declines in demand resulting from businesses being deemed to be nonessential by governments in the markets we serve and from nonessential and essential businesses suffering adverse effects from reduced levels of economic activity in our markets these factors together or in combination with other events or occurrences that may not yet be known or anticipated may materially and adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the ongoing covid19 pandemic has resulted in meaningfully lower stock prices for many companies as well as the trading prices for many other securities the further spread of the covid19 outbreak as well as ongoing or new governmental regulatory and private sector responses to the pandemic may materially disrupt banking and other economic activity generally and in the areas in which we operate this could result in further decline in demand for our banking products and services and could negatively impact among other things our liquidity regulatory capital and our growth strategy any one or more of these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations we are taking precautions to protect the safety and wellbeing of our employees and customers however no assurance can be given that the steps being taken will be adequate or deemed to be appropriate nor can we predict the level of disruption which will occur to our employees ability to provide customer support and service if we are unable to recover from a business disruption on a timely basis our business financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected we may also incur additional costs to remedy damages caused by such disruptions which could further adversely affect our business financial condition and results of operations the covid19 pandemic has resulted in a higher allowance for credit losses acl determined in accordance with the current expected credit loss or cecl standard and may result in increased volatility and further increases in our allowance for loan losses the measure of our acl is dependent on the adoption and interpretation of applicable accounting standards the financial accounting standards board issued a new credit impairment model the current expected credit loss or cecl standard which has become effective and was adopted by us in the first quarter of under the cecl model we are required to present certain financial assets carried at amortized cost such as loans held for investment and heldtomaturity debt securities at the net amount expected to be collected the measurement of expected credit losses is based on information about past events including historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amount and certain management judgments over the life of the loan this initial measurement took place as of january at the time of our adoption of cecl and measurements will occur periodically thereafter the adoption of the cecl model has materially affected how we determine our acl and combined with the effects of the covid19 pandemic required us to significantly increase our allowance as of march the cecl model may create more volatility in the level of our acl as compared to the incurred loss standard that we previously applied in determining our acl the cecl model requires us to estimate the lifetime expected credit loss with respect to loans and other applicable financial assets which may change more rapidly than the level of incurred losses that would have been used to determine our allowance for loan losses under the prior incurred loss standard the potentially material effects of the covid19 pandemic on lifetime expected credit loss and the challenges associated with estimating lifetime credit losses in view of the uncertain ultimate impacts of the pandemic may result in increased volatility and significant additions to our acl in the future which could have a material and adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations as a participating lender in the sba paycheck protection program ppp the company and the bank are subject to additional risks of litigation from the banks customers or other parties regarding the banks processing of loans for the ppp and risks that the sba may not fund some or all ppp loan guaranties on march president trump signed the cares act which included a billion loan program administered through the sba referred to as the ppp under the ppp small businesses and other entities and individuals can apply for loans from existing sba lenders and other approved regulated lenders that enroll in the program subject to numerous limitations and eligibility criteria the bank is participating as a lender in the ppp the ppp opened on april however because of the short timeframe between the passing of the cares act and the opening of the ppp there is some ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp which exposes the company to risks relating to noncompliance with the ppp as of april we have secured funding of approximately loans totaling approximately billion though the ppp program on or about april the sba notified lenders that the billion earmarked for the ppp was exhausted congress approved additional funding for the ppp of approximately billion on april since the opening of the ppp several other larger banks have been subject to litigation regarding the process and procedures that such banks used in processing applications for the ppp the company and the bank may be exposed to the risk of litigation from both customers and noncustomers that approached the bank regarding ppp loans regarding its process and procedures used in processing applications for the ppp if any such litigation is filed against the company or the bank and is not resolved in a manner favorable to the company or the bank it may result in significant financial liability or adversely affect the companys reputation in addition litigation can be costly regardless of outcome any financial liability litigation costs or reputational damage caused by ppp related litigation could have a material adverse impact on our business financial condition and results of operations the bank also has credit risk on ppp loans if a determination is made by the sba that there is a deficiency in the manner in which the loan was originated funded or serviced by the bank such as an issue with the eligibility of a borrower to receive a ppp loan which may or may not be related to the ambiguity in the laws rules and guidance regarding the operation of the ppp in the event of a loss resulting from a default on a ppp loan and a determination by the sba that there was a deficiency in the manner in which the ppp loan was originated funded or serviced by the company the sba may deny its liability under the guaranty reduce the amount of the guaranty or if it has already paid under the guaranty seek recovery of any loss related to the deficiency from the company
