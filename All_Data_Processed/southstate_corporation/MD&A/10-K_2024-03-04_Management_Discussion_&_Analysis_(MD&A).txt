corporation and its subsidiarys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and also analyzes our financial condition as of december as compared to december like most banking institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on most of which we pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interest bearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities there are risks inherent in all loans so we maintain an allowance for credit losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by recording a provision or recovery for credit losses against our earnings in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during

shareholders was down million or in compared to for further discussion of the companys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december see results of operations section of this mda starting on page at december we had total assets of approximately billion compared to approximately billion at december see the financial condition section of this mda starting on page for a more detailed description of the change in our balance sheet with high inflation and a rising interest rate environment there was some deterioration in asset quality in however our overall asset quality results remained strong during the year net charge offs as a percentage of average loans increased to compared to for the year ended december the total nonperforming assets npas increased million to million at december from million at december nonacquired npas increased million to million at december from million at december which was related to an increase in nonacquired nonperforming loans of million nonacquired oreo and other npas increased by to as of december compared to as of december acquired npas decreased to million at december from million at december acquired nonperforming loans decreased and acquired oreo and other nonperforming assets decreased total npas as a percentage of total assets increased basis points to at december compared to at december while net chargeoffs totaled million the company recorded a total of million of provision for credit losses for the trailing eight quarters our npa ratios remained historically low our efficiency ratio was for the year ended december compared to for the same period in the increase in our efficiency ratio was due to the effects of a increase in noninterest expense being greater than the effects of a increase in the total net interest income and noninterest income the increase in noninterest expense was mainly due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of million an increase in fdic regulatory and other regulatory charges of million and the recording of the fdic special assessment expense of million in we continue to remain wellcapitalized with a total riskbased capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of as of december compared to and respectively at december the improvement in the total riskbased capital ratio was mainly due to t otal riskbased capital increasing with the increase in equity resulting from net income of million recognized in along with the increase in the allowance for credit losses and unfunded commitments of million includable in tier capital total riskweighted assets increased million or in the improvement in the tier leverage ratio was due to the increase in tier capital of with the increase in equity resulting from net income of million recognized in regulatory average assets used to calculate the tier leverage ratio only increased million or in we believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities for further discussion of the companys financial condition as of december compared to december see financial condition section of this mda starting on page recent events capital management in april the companys board of directors approved a new stock repurchase program stock repurchase program authorizing the company to repurchase up to of the companys common shares along with the remaining authorized shares of from the stock repurchase program for a total authorization of  during the company repurchased a total of  at a weighted average price of excluding cost of commissions per share pursuant to the stock repurchase program during the company did not repurchase any shares pursuant to the stock repurchase program during the first quarter of before the approval of the stock repurchase program the company repurchased a total of  at a weighted average price of per share pursuant to the stock repurchase plan critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry our financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of our audited consolidated financial statements the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments business combinations we account for acquisitions under fasb asc topic business combinations which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting all identifiable assets acquired including loans and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value we adopted asu financial instruments credit losses topic measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january which requires us to record purchased financial assets with credit deterioration pcd assets defined as a morethaninsignificant deterioration in credit quality since origination or issuance at the purchase price plus the allowance for credit losses expected at the time of acquisition under this method there is no provision for credit losses affecting net income on acquisition of pcd assets changes in estimates of expected credit losses after acquisition are recognized as provision for credit loss expense or recovery of credit losses in subsequent periods as they arise any noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets with credit deterioration shall be allocated to each individual asset at the acquisition date the initial allowance for credit losses determined on a collective basis shall be allocated to individual assets to appropriately allocate any noncredit discount or premium the noncredit discount or premium after the adjustment for the allowance for credit losses shall be accreted into interest income using the interest method based on the effective interest rate determined after the adjustment for credit losses at the adoption date a purchased financial asset that does not qualify as a pcd asset is accounted for similar to an originated financial asset generally this means that an entity recognizes the allowance for credit losses for nonpcd assets through net income at the time of acquisition in addition both the credit discount and noncredit discount or premium resulting from acquiring a pool of purchased financial assets that do not qualify as pcd assets shall be allocated to each individual asset this combined discount or premium shall be accreted into interest income using the effective yield method for further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions see note 1summary of significant accounting policies note 2mergers and acquisitions note 4loans and note 5allowance for credit losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses or acl the acl reflects managements estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect management has a methodology determining its acl for loans held for investment and certain offbalancesheet credit exposures management considers the effects of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts on the collectability of the loan portfolio the companys estimate of its acl involves a high degree of judgment therefore managements process for determining expected credit losses may result in a range of expected credit losses it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach a different reasonable conclusion the companys acl recorded on the balance sheet reflects managements best estimate within the range of expected credit losses the company recognizes in net income the amount needed to adjust the acl for managements current estimate of expected credit losses see note 1summary of significant accounting policies for further detailed descriptions of our estimation process and methodology related to the acl see also note 5allowance for credit losses and provision for credit losses in this mda one of the most significant judgments influencing the acl is the macroeconomic forecasts from the thirdparty service provider changes in the economic forecasts may significantly affect the estimated credit losses which may potentially lead to materially different quantitatively modeled allowance levels from one reporting period to the next given the dynamic relationship between macroeconomic variables it is difficult to estimate the impact of a change in any one individual variable on the acl southstate uses a thirdparty service provider to support the economic forecast assumptions under cecl forecast by providing various levels of economic scenarios these scenarios are weighted in accordance with management assessment of scenarios as well as expectations of the general market and industry conditions to illustrate the sensitivity of these scenarios if a probability weighting was applied to the adverse scenario rather than using the probabilityweighted three scenario approach this would result in an increase in the acl by approximately million conversely if a probability weighting was applied to the upside scenario this would result in a decrease in the acl by approximately million the adverse scenario includes assumptions including but not limited to an extended shutdown of the federal government inflation global events such as the russianukrainian conflict tensions between china and taiwan tensions in the middle east political risks increased unemployment and the us economy falling into recession in conversely the upside scenario includes assumptions such as a swift resolution of international conflicts stabilization of consumer confidence more than full employment reduced political tensions resolution of congressional gridlock and other favorable assumptions this sensitivity analysis and related impact on the acl is a hypothetical analysis and is not intended to represent managements judgments or assumptions of qualitative loss factors that were utilized at december mortgage servicing rights msrs the company has a mortgage loan servicing portfolio with related mortgage servicing rights msrs represent the present value of the future net servicing fees from servicing mortgage loans servicing assets and servicing liabilities must be initially measured at fair value if practicable for subsequent measurements an entity can choose to measure servicing assets and liabilities either based on fair value or lower of cost or market the company uses the fair value measurement option for msrs msrs are carried at fair value with changes in fair value recorded as a component of mortgage banking income in the consolidated statements of income the methodology used to determine the fair value of msrs is subjective and requires the development of a number of assumptions including anticipated prepayments of loan principal fair value is determined by estimating the present value of the assets future cash flows utilizing estimated marketbased prepayment rates and discount rates interest rates and other economic factors and assumptions validated through comparison to trade information industry surveys and with the use of independent thirdparty appraisals risks inherent in the msrs valuation include higher than expected prepayment rates andor delayed receipt of cash flows the value of msrs is significantly affected by interest rates available in the marketplace which influence loan prepayment speeds in general during periods of declining interest rates the value of mortgage servicing rights declines due to increasing prepayments attributable to increased mortgage refinance activity conversely during periods of rising interest rates the value of servicing rights generally increases due to reduced refinance activity goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed in a business combination as of december and the balance of goodwill was billion goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value in january the fasb issued asu no which simplified the accounting for goodwill impairment for all entities by requiring impairment charges to be based on step of the previous accounting guidances twostep impairment test under asc topic under the guidance if a reporting units carrying amount exceeds its fair value an entity will record an impairment charge based on that difference the impairment charge will be limited to the amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit the standard eliminated the requirement to calculate a goodwill impairment charge using step which involved calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the standard does not change the guidance on completing step of the goodwill impairment test an entity is able to perform an optional qualitative goodwill impairment assessment before proceeding to the quantitative step of determining whether the reporting units carrying amount exceeds it fair value we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of october our annual test date and determined that no impairment charge was necessary as the fair value of the entity exceeded the carrying value we will continue to monitor the impact of current economic conditions and other events on the companys business operating results cash flows and financial condition if the current economic conditions and other events were to deteriorate and our stock price falls below current levels we will have to reevaluate the impact on our financial condition and potential impairment of goodwill core deposit intangibles and client list intangibles consist primarily of amortizing assets established during the acquisition of other banks this includes whole bank acquisitions and the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities from other financial institutions core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of longterm deposit relationships acquired in these transactions client list intangibles represent the value of longterm client relationships for the correspondent banking and wealth and trust management business these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled the company determines the realization of deferred tax assets by considering all positive and negative evidence available including the impact of recent operating results future reversals of taxable temporary differences future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards and tax planning strategies determining whether deferred tax assets are realizable is subjective and requires the use of significant judgment a valuation allowance is provided when it is morelikelythannot that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return additionally income tax returns are filed by the company or its subsidiaries in various state and local jurisdictions based on the companys footprint the tax laws and regulations in each jurisdiction are complex and may be subject to different interpretations by the company and the relevant taxing authorities therefore the company is required to exercise judgment in determining tax accruals and evaluating the companys tax positions including evaluating uncertain tax positions see note summary of significant accounting policies and note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further details and discussion recent accounting standards and pronouncements for information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements see note to our audited consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies results of operations consolidated net income available to common shareholders decreased by million or to million for the year ended december compared to million for the year ended december and increased million or compared to million in below are key highlights of our results of operations during table start a million increase in interest income resulting from a million increase in interest income from loans and loans held for sale a million increase in interest income from investment securities slightly offset by a million decrease in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits the increases in interest income in loans and investment securities were mainly due to the increase in yield in the rising rate environment in and in as the federal reserve bank has raised its federal funds rate basis points the increase in interest income from loans is also due to the increase in the average balance of loans of billion through organic loan growth the decline in interest income from federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and interestbearing deposits was due to a decline in average balance of billion as liquidity tightened in with a more competitive deposit market in the rising rate environment table endtable start a million increase in interest expense resulted from a million increase in interest expense from deposits a million increase in interest expense from corporate and subordinated debentures and other borrowings and a million and million increase in interest expense in federal funds purchased and securities sold under agreements to repurchase respectively the rise in interest expense is attributed primarily to increased costs across all categories of interestbearing liabilities as interest rates have increased in and the increase in average cost of interestbearing liabilities was particularly felt in with the stress in financial markets and liquidity along with the increased competition for deposits the average cost of interestbearing liabilities increased basis point in compared to the prior year table endtable start a million decrease in noninterest income which resulted primarily from a million decrease in correspondent banking and capital markets income a million decline in mortgage banking income a million decrease in debit prepaid atm and merchant card related income and a million decrease in sba income these decreases were offset by a million increase in other noninterest income a million increase in service charges on deposit accounts a million increase in bank owned life insurance boli income and a increase in trust and investment services income see noninterest income section on page for further discussion table endtable start a million increase in noninterest expense resulted primarily from a million increase in salaries and employee benefits expense the million accrual for the fdic special assessment in a million increase in fdic assessment and other regulatory charges a million increase in other noninterest expense a million increase in business development and staff related expense a million increase information services expenses a million increase in professional fees and a million increase in oreo expense and loan related expense these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in merger branch consolidation and severance related expense and a million decrease in amortization expense of intangible assets see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion table endtable start a million increase in the provision for allowance for credit losses as the company recorded provision for credit losses of million during compared to recording a provision for credit losses of million in during we recorded a higher provision for credit losses as economic forecasts reflected the continued stress of inflation and rising interest rates that began in along with tight labor markets and global uncertainty and table endtable start lower income tax provision of primarily due to the change in pretax book income between the two years the company recorded pretax book income of million in compared to pretax book income of million in the companys effective tax rate was for the year ended december compared to for the year ended december table endtable start basic earnings per common share decreased to in from in and decreased from in table endtable start diluted earnings per common share decreased to in from in and decreased from in table end table start return on average assets was in a slight decrease compared to in and a decrease compared to in the decrease in compared to was driven by both the increase in total average assets of million or to billion in along with the decrease in net income of million or to million the increase in average assets mainly resulted from the increase in nonacquired loans through organic growth partially offset by declines in investment securities and federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and other interestearning deposit as liquidity declined in the increase in compared to was driven by both increases in loans and investment securities through both the atlantic capital acquisition and organic growth table endtable start return on average common shareholders equity decreased to in compared to in and decreased from in the decrease in compared to was driven by the growth in average common shareholders equity of or million while net income declined by or million to million the increase in average common shareholders equity was mainly due to net income in the decrease in compared to was driven by the higher growth in average common shareholders equity of or million compared to the growth in net income of or million to million the increase in average equity in was primarily resulted from the atlantic capital acquisition table end table start our dividend payout ratio was for compared with in and in the increase in the dividend payout ratio in compared to was due to the increase in total dividends paid during of or million while the net income available to common shareholders decreased or million the increase in the dividend payout ratio in compared to was due to the increase in total dividends paid during of or million being greater than the increase in net income available to common shareholders which increased or million table end net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our net income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interestearning assets rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the relative balances of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities net interest income divided by average interestearning assets represents our net interest margin the federal reserve made four basispoint rate increases in the most recent in late july resulting in a range of to at december as a result the company operated under an increasing rate environment for the majority of the year in while it operated under a comparatively lower rate environment in compared to net interest income and net interest margin are highlighted for the year ended december compared to table start the nontax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin increased by basis points and basis points respectively in compared to the net interest margin increased primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during despite the basis points increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities being greater than the basis points increase in the yield on interestearning assets our net interest margin increased due to average interestearning assets of billion being greater than average interestbearing liabilities of million during table endtable start o overall our yield on interestearning assets in increased basis points from primarily due to higher yields on all interestearning assets as the federal reserve bank raised interest rates basis points starting late in first quarter of the increase in interest rates in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of billion along with the decline in the average balances of lower yielding federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and other interestearning deposits of billion and investment securities of million affected the overall yield increase in interestearning assets between the comparable periods table end table start o the average cost of interestbearing liabilities in compared to increased basis points this increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of all deposit accounts federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreement to repurchase and other borrowings the average cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points as the increase occurred in all deposit categories the average cost of federal funds purchased and securities purchased with agreements to repurchase increased basis points and basis points respectively while the average cost of other borrowings increased basis points the increase in the average cost of other borrowings was due to the variable rate trust preferred debt the increase in overall average cost of interestbearing liabilities for the from the same period in was also a result of the change in the mix of deposit balances shifting from lowercosting savings and transaction deposit accounts to highercosting certificates and other time deposits and money market accounts table endtable start our net interest income increased by million or to billion during compared to as our interest income increased million while interest expense increased million table endtable start o our interest income increased by million due to higher nonacquired loan interest income of million attributable to both a higher average balance of billion through organic loan growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio along with a higher yield of basis points due to the rising rate environment investment securities interest income was higher by million because of an increase in the yield of basis points due to the rising rate environment table endtable start o these increases in interest income were partially offset by lower federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of million and lower interest income on acquired loans of million due to lower average balances by billion and billion respectively interest income on loans held for sale also declined by due to a lower average balance of million the effects from the declines in average balance were partially offset by the increases in yields of basis points on acquired loans basis on federal funds sold and repurchase agreements and basis points on loans held for sale from the effects of the rising rate environment table endtable start o our interest expense increased by of million in compared to due primarily to interest expense on interestbearing deposits increasing million which was attributable to an increase in the average cost of basis points as well as an increase in the average balance of billion as noted above the increase in expense on interestbearing deposit was significantly impacted by the change in mix from lower costing savings and transaction deposit accounts to higher costing certificate and other time deposit accounts and money market accounts as customer sought higher yields in the competitive deposit market in interest expense related to other borrowings increased million due to an increase in average cost of basis points along with an increase in the average balance of million interest expense on federal funds purchased and repurchased agreements increased million and million respectively due to increases in the average costs of basis points and basis points respectively table endtable start average interestearning assets increased million or to billion in compared to table endtable start o the increase in the average balance on nonacquired loan portfolio of billion was due to organic growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table endtable start o the decrease in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of billion was due to paydowns payoffs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table endtable start o the average balance in investment securities decreased by million the decrease in average was primarily a result of maturities calls and paydowns on available for sale and held to maturity securities of million and million respectively during the year along with sales of available for sale securities of million these decreases were partially offset by an increase in market value on available for sale securities of million and purchases of available for sale securities of million table endtable start o the average balance on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and other interest earning deposits decreased billion as the liquidity tightened in with the more competitive market for deposits with costumers seeking higher yields table endtable start average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or to billion in compared to table endtable start o the average balance of interestbearing deposits increased billion primarily due to an increase in the average balance of higher costing time deposits of billion of this increase in time deposits million was due to an increase in the use of brokered time deposits during the average balance of transaction and money market accounts increased million during as lower costing savings account deposits declined million within transaction and money market accounts there was a shift to the higher costing money market account accounts in as customers sought higher yields driving the increase in balance table end table start o the average balance of federal funds purchased decreased million and repurchase agreements decreased million table endtable start o the average balance of other borrowings increased by million due to the increased use of shortterm fhlb advance during as deposits markets became more competitive table end compared to net interest income and net interest margin are highlighted for the year ended december compared to table start both the nontax equivalent and the tax equivalent net interest margin increased by basis points in compared to while the yield on interestearning assets increased basis points the cost of interestbearing liabilities marginally increased basis points the increase in the net interest margin was primarily due to the rising rate environment in effect during as our interestearning assets have repriced more quickly than our interestbearing liabilities the increase was also due to a change in asset mix as the lower yielding interestbearing deposit and federal funds sold declined in while our higher yielding loan portfolio and investments increased table endtable start o overall our yield on interestearning assets in increased basis points from primarily due to higher yields on all interestearning assets as the federal reserve bank raised interest rates basis points starting late in first quarter of the increases in interest rates in combination with the increase in the average balance of the higher yielding loan portfolio of billion and the investment portfolio of billion along with the decline in the average balance of lower yielding interestearning deposits and federal funds sold of billion affected the overall yield increase between the comparable periods table endtable start o the average cost of interestbearing liabilities in compared to increased basis points this increase was driven by the effects from the rising rate environment on the repricing of variable rate products including interestbearing and savings deposits federal funds purchased and trust preferred corporate debt the cost of interestbearing and savings deposits increased basis points while the cost of federal funds purchased increased basis points and the cost of corporate and subordinated debentures increased basis points overall interestbearing deposits have been slower to reprice in the rising rate environment table endtable start our net interest income increased by million or to billion during compared to as interest income increased million and interest expense only increased million table endtable start o our interest income increased by million due to table endtable start higher nonacquired loan interest income of million due to a higher average balance of billion higher investment securities interest income of million because of a higher average balance of billion and higher federal funds sold and repurchase agreements interest income of million due to the rising rate environment in effect during the current year even though the average balance was lower by billion table endtable start these increases in interest income were partially offset by lower interest income on acquired loans of million due to a lower average balance of billion resulting from paydowns payoffs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio interest income on loans held for sale also declined by million due to a lower average balance of million table endtable start o our interest expense increased by of million in compared to due to table endtable start interest expense on interestbearing deposits increasing million because of a slight increase in the average cost of basis point along with a billion increase in the average balance interest expense on federal funds purchased increasing million because of an increase in the average cost of basis points and interest expense related to other borrowings increasing million because of an increase in the average cost of basis points table endtable start average interestearning assets increased billion or to billion in compared to table endtable start o the increase in the average balance on nonacquired loan portfolio of billion was due to organic growth and renewals of matured acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table endtable start o the decrease in the average balance on the acquired loan portfolio of billion was due to paydowns payoffs and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table end table start o the increase in the average balance in investment securities of billion was a result of the bank using a portion of the excess funds to increase the size of its investment securities along with the banks strategy on replacing lower yielding securities with higher yielding securities as interest rates started to increase in the first quarter of in addition to retaining a portion of the investment securities acquired from atlantic capital on march the excess liquidity was from the growth in deposits in and during the first half of table endtable start average interestbearing liabilities increased billion or to billion in compared to table endtable start o the average balance of interestbearing deposits increased billion primarily due to the interestbearing deposits of billion assumed from the atlantic capital acquisition on march the average balance of lower costing interestbearing transaction accounts money market accounts and savings accounts increased billion while the average balance of higher costing time deposits declined million in compared to table endtable start o the average balance of federal funds purchased decreased million and repurchase agreements decreased table endtable start o the average balance of other borrowings increased by million due to million of subordinated debentures assumed from atlantic capital on march partially offset by the redemption

below the amortized cost basis of a security to determine whether there is a credit loss associated with the decline in fair value on at least a quarterly basis and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation for securities designated as held for sale credit losses are calculated individually rather than collectively using a discounted cash flow method whereby management compares the present value of expected cash flows with the amortized cost basis of the security the credit loss component would be recognized through the provision for credit losses consideration is given to the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer including looking at default and delinquency rates the outlook for receiving the contractual cash flows of the investments the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost our intent to hold the security as well as there being no requirement to sell the security the anticipated outlook for changes in the general level of interest rates credit ratings thirdparty guarantees and collateral values in analyzing an issuers financial condition management considers whether the securities are issued by the

carrying balances being below current collateral values the decline in restructured nonaccrual loans over both the nonacquired and acquired loan portfolios was due to the adoption of asu effective

the bank had a total of million loans to borrowers experiencing financial difficulty of the million million loans were current and million loans were to days past due allowance for credit losses acl on loans and certain offbalancesheet credit exposure as stated previously the acl reflects managements estimate of the portion of the amortized cost of loans and unfunded commitments that it does not expect to collect the company records loans charged off against the acl and subsequent recoveries if any increase the acl when they are recognized management considers forwardlooking information in estimating expected credit losses the company subscribes to a thirdparty service which provides a quarterly macroeconomic baseline outlook and alternative scenarios for the united states economy the baseline along with the evaluation of alternative scenarios is used by management to determine the best estimate within the range of expected credit losses management evaluates the appropriateness of the reasonable and supportable forecast scenarios and takes into consideration the scenarios in relation to actual economic and other data such as gross domestic product growth monetary and fiscal policy inflation supply chain issues and global events like the russianukraine conflict as well as the volatility and magnitude of changes within those scenarios quarter over quarter and consideration of conditions within the banks operating environment and geographic area additional forecast scenarios may be weighted along with the baseline forecast to arrive at the final reserve estimate while periods of relative economic stability should generally lead to stability in forecast scenarios and weightings to estimate credit losses periods of instability can likewise require management to adjust the selection of scenarios and weightings in accordance with the accounting standards for the contractual term that extends beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to the long term mean of historical factors within four quarters using a straightline approach the company generally uses a fourquarter forecast and a fourquarter reversion period in spite of the rapid interest rate hikes experienced cycletodate the us has thus far avoided a recession although an inverted yield curve such as observed in the current interest rate environment often portends a coming recession management continues to use a blended forecast scenario of the baseline upside and more severe scenario depending on the circumstances and economic outlook as of december management selected a baseline weighting of a weighting for an upside scenario and a weighting for the more severe scenario compared to a baseline weighting of and the more severe scenario of at the end of the fourth quarter of while the december federal open market committee meeting brought some clarity around the path of interest rates and condition of the economy the scenario weightings reflect continued recognition of downside risks in the economic forecast from persistent levels of inflation rising interest rates and tightening credit conditions conducive of a mild recession while employment figures still showed resilience and actual loan losses remain at low levels continued downward shifts in the forecasted commercial real estate price index elevated modeled expected losses for the commercial real estate and commercial construction and land development which excludes residential construction loan segments as a result of the continued pressures in the market and tightening credit conditions

reserve for unfunded commitments totaled million or of the combined banks total at march the company has a variety of assets that have a component that qualifies as an offbalance sheet exposure these primarily include undrawn portions of revolving lines of credit and standby letters of credit the expected losses associated with these exposures within the unfunded portion of the expected credit loss will be recorded as a liability on the balance sheet management has determined that a majority of the companys offbalancesheet credit exposures are not unconditionally cancellable management completes funding studies based on historical data to estimate the percentage of unfunded loan commitments that will ultimately be funded to calculate the reserve for unfunded commitments management applies this funding rate along with the loss factor rate determined for each pooled loan segment to unfunded loan commitments excluding unconditionally cancellable exposures and letters of credit to arrive at the reserve for unfunded loan commitments as of december and the liabilities recorded for expected credit losses on unfunded commitments were million and million respectively the current

authorized to be repurchased we are subject to regulations with respect to certain riskbased capital ratios these riskbased capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and offbalance sheet risks the values of both balance sheet and offbalance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy the leverage ratio is equal to tier capital divided by total consolidated onbalance sheet assets minus amounts deducted from tier capital the leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets specifically we are required to maintain the following minimum capital ratios table start a cet1 riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a tier riskbased capital ratio of table endtable start a total riskbased capital ratio of and table endtable start a leverage ratio of table end under the current capital rules tier capital includes two components cet1 capital and additional tier capital the highest form of capital cet1 capital consists solely of common stock plus related surplus retained earnings accumulated other comprehensive income otherwise referred to as aoci and limited amounts of minority interests that are in the form of common stock additional tier capital is primarily comprised of noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and tier minority interests tier capital generally includes the allowance for loan losses up to of riskweighted assets qualifying preferred stock subordinated debt trust preferred securities and qualifying tier minority interests less any deductions in tier instruments of an unconsolidated financial institution aoci is presumptively included in cet1 capital and often would operate to reduce this category of capital when the current capital rules were first implemented the bank exercised its onetime opportunity at the end of the first quarter of for covered banking organizations to opt out of much of this treatment of aoci allowing us to retain our preexisting treatment for aoci in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions or discretionary bonus payments to executives a banking organization must maintain a capital conservation buffer on top of its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer must consist solely of tier common equity but the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital resulting in the following effective minimum capital plus capital conservation buffer ratios i a cet1 capital ratio of ii a tier riskbased capital ratio of and iii a total riskbased capital ratio of the bank is also subject to the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action which identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized and is based on specified thresholds for each of the three riskbased regulatory capital ratios cet1 tier capital and total capital and for the leverage ratio the federal banking agencies revised their regulatory capital rules to i address the implementation of cecl ii provide an optional threeyear phasein period for the adoption date adverse regulatory capital effects that banking organizations are expected to experience upon adopting cecl and iii require the use of cecl in stress tests beginning with the capital planning and stress testing cycle for certain banking organizations that are subject to stress testing cecl became effective for us on january and the company applied the provisions of the standard using the modified retrospective method as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings related to the implementation of asu we recorded additional allowance for credit losses for loans of million deferred tax assets of million an additional reserve for unfunded commitments of million and an adjustment to retained earnings of million instead of recognizing the effects on regulatory capital from asu at adoption the company initially elected the option for recognizing the adoption date effects on the companys regulatory capital calculations over a threeyear phasein in response to the covid19 pandemic in the federal banking agencies issued a final rule for additional transitional relief to regulatory capital related to the impact of the adoption of cecl the company chose the fiveyear transition method and is deferring the recognition of the effects from the adoption date and the cecl difference for the first two years of application the modified cecl transitional amount was fixed as of december and that amount began the threeyear phase out in the first quarter of with phased out in at december and approximately million and million respectively was added to tier capital at the company and bank as a

correspondent customers we continue to take in shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise the bank has a granular deposit base comprised of over million accounts with an average deposit size of the top ten and twenty deposit relationships comprise approximately three and four percent of total deposits approximately of total deposits are noninterest bearing the banks deposit beta which represents the change in the banks cost of deposits over the change in the federal funds target rate during this cycle from march through december is approximately the bank supplements its inmarket deposits with brokered deposits while the bank has a policy limit for brokered time deposits of no more than of total deposits it has operated well below this policy limit at december the percentage of brokered time deposits to total deposits was during calendar years and the highest ratio of brokered time deposits to total deposits was on march during the first quarter of the company sought to increase liquidity with the turmoil in the financial markets after the few regional banks failed and increased the balance in brokered time deposits to billion as the financial markets stabilized during the company has let the brokered time deposits runoff to an ending balance of million at december as discussed below the bank maintains credit facilities with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the federal reserve bank of atlanta the table below compares primary funding sources to uninsured deposits as of december table 26primary funding sources to uninsured deposits table start dollars in millions available capacity federal home loan bank of atlanta federal reserve discount window of atlanta cash and cash equivalents par value of securities that can be pledged to btfp total primary sources uninsured deposits excluding collateralized deposits uninsured and collateralized deposits coverage ratio uninsured deposits coverage ratio uninsured and collateralized deposits ratio of uninsured and collateralized deposits to total deposits table end through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the thirdparty although our experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the resources to meet these obligations should the need arise our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks the bank may also access funds from borrowing facilities established with the federal home loan bank of atlanta and the discount window of the federal reserve bank of atlanta at december the bank had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in shortterm fhlb advances and million fhlb letters of credit outstanding at yearend leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility at december the bank had billion of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window and federal funds credit lines of million with no balances outstanding at quarterend the bank also has an internal limit on brokered deposits of of total deposits which would allow capacity of billion at december the bank had million of outstanding brokered deposits at the end of the year leaving billion in available capacity as per the internal policy limit of of total deposits all of these resources would provide an additional billion in funding if we needed additional liquidity the bank also has billion in market value of unpledged securities at december that can be pledged to attain additional funds if necessary we can also consider actions such as deposit promotions to increase core deposits the company has a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no balance outstanding at december we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels liquidity key risk indicators are reported to the board of directors on a quarterly basis we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would use these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of equity vary in relation to the behavior of interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we define interest rate risk as the risk to earnings and equity arising from the behavior of interest rates these behaviors include increases and decreases in interest rates as well as continuation of the current interest rate environment our interest rate risk principally consists of reprice option basis and yield curve risk reprice risk results from differences in the maturity or repricing characteristics of asset and liability portfolios option risk arises from embedded options in the investment and loan portfolios such as investment securities calls and loan prepayment options option risk also exists since deposit customers may withdraw funds at their discretion in response to general market conditions competitive alternatives to existing accounts or other factors the exercise of such options may result in higher costs or lower revenue basis risk refers to the potential for changes in the underlying relationship between market rates or indices which subsequently result in narrowing spreads on interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities basis risk also exists in administered rate liabilities such as interestbearing checking accounts savings accounts and money market accounts where the price sensitivity of such products may vary relative to general markets rates yield curve risk refers to adverse consequences of nonparallel shifts in the yield curves of various market indices that impact our assets and liabilities we use simulation analysis as a primary method to assess earnings at risk and equity at risk due to assumed changes in interest rates management uses the results of its various simulation analyses in combination with other data and observations to formulate strategies designed to maintain interest rate risk within risk tolerances simulation analysis involves the use of several assumptions including but not limited to the timing of cash flows such as the terms of contractual agreements investment security calls loan prepayment speeds deposit attrition rates the interest rate sensitivity of loans and deposits relative to general market rates and the behavior of interest rates and spreads the assumptions for loan prepayments deposit decay and nonstable deposit balances are derived from models that use historical bank data these models are independently validated equity at risk simulation uses assumptions regarding discount rates that value cash flows simulation analysis is highly dependent on model assumptions that may vary from actual outcomes key simulation assumptions are subject to sensitivity analysis to assess the impact of assumption changes on earnings at risk and equity at risk model assumptions are reviewed by our assumptions committee while the bank is continuously refining its modeling methodology the core principles of the methodology have remained stable over the past two years earnings at risk is defined as the percentage change in net interest income due to assumed changes in interest rates earnings at risk is generally used to assess interest rate risk over relatively short time horizons equity at risk is defined as the percentage change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value the discounted present value of all cash flows represents our economic value of equity equity at risk is generally considered a measure of the longterm interest rate exposures of the balance sheet at a point in time the earnings simulation models consider our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives as well as a number of behavioral assumptions applied to certain assets and liabilities mortgage banking derivatives used in the ordinary course of business consist of forward sales contracts and interest rate lock commitments on residential mortgage loans these derivatives involve underlying items such as interest rates and are designed to mitigate risk derivatives are also used to hedge mortgage servicing rights for additional information see note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements from time to time we execute interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks under these arrangements the company enters into a variable rate loan with a client in addition to a swap agreement the swap agreement effectively converts the clients variable rate loan into a fixed rate loan the company then enters into a matching swap agreement with a thirdparty dealer to offset its exposure on the customer swap the company may also execute interest rate swap agreements that are not specific to client loans as of december the company had a series of shortterm interest rate hedges to address monthly accrual mismatches related to the companys arc program and its transition from libor to sofr after june for additional information on these derivatives refer to note 28derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our interest rate risk key indicators are applied to a static balance sheet using forward rates from the moodys baseline scenario the company will also use other rate forecasts including but not limited to moodys consensus scenario this base case scenario assumes the maturity composition of asset and liability rollover volumes is modeled to approximately replicate current consolidated balance sheet characteristics throughout the simulation these treatments are consistent with the companys goal of assessing current interest rate risk embedded in its current balance sheet the base case scenario assumes that maturing or repricing assets and liabilities are replaced at prices referencing forward rates derived from the selected rate forecast consistent with current balance sheet pricing characteristics key rate drivers are used to price assets and liabilities with sensitivity assumptions used to price nonmaturity deposits the sensitivity assumptions for the pricing of nonmaturity deposits are subjected to sensitivity analysis no less frequently than on an annual basis interest rate shocks are applied to the base case on an instantaneous basis our policy establishes the use of upward and downward interest rate shocks applied in basis point increments through basis points we calculate smaller rate shocks as needed at times market conditions may result in assumed rate movements that will be deemphasized for example during a period of ultralow interest rates certain downward rate shocks may be impractical the model simulation results produced from the base case scenario and related instantaneous shocks for changes in net interest income and changes in the economic value of equity are referred to as the core scenario analysis and constitute the policy key risk indicators for interest rate risk when compared to risk tolerances as of december the company was operating within it interest rate key risk indicator policy limits during the beta assumption applied to total deposits increased to reflect changes in deposit mix from the beginning of the upward rate cycle our deposit costs have increased from five basis points to one hundred sixty basis points during this period the federal funds rate has increased basis points accordingly our cycle to date beta has been approximately management recognizes the difficulty using historical data to forecast deposit betas in the current environment for internal purposes and based on the deposit mix as of december the total deposit beta assumption was for internal forecasting management will apply overlays to certain assumptions to adjust for current market conditions rather than use assumptions modeled over longer periods of time the following interest rate risk metrics are derived from analysis using the moodys consensus scenario published in january as the base case as of december the earnings simulations indicated that the year impact of an instantaneous basis point parallel increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure also assumes a static balance sheet base case scenario with rate shocks applied as described above at december the percentage change in eve due to a 100basis point increase or decrease in interest rates was decrease and increase respectively the percentage changes in eve due to a 200basis point increase or decrease in interest rates were decrease and increase respectively the interest rate shock analysis results for eve sensitivities are unusual as the benefits of repricing assets are mitigated by increasing deposit costs and downward shocks are constrained on various balance sheet categories due to the inability to price products below floors or zero this is particularly meaningful given the cost of deposits as of december the analysis below reflects a base case and shocked scenarios that assume a static balance sheet projection where volume is added to maintain balances consistent with current levels base case assumes new and repricing volumes reference forward rates derived from the moodys consensus rate forecast instantaneous parallel and sustained interest rate shocks are applied to the base case scenario over a oneyear time horizon table 26rate shock analysis net interest income and economic value of equity table start percentage change in net interest income over one year up basis points up basis points up basis points up basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points down basis points table end libor transition the publication of all tenors of us dollar libor on a representative basis ceased as of december as previously noted we established a crossfunctional libor transition working group that assessed the companys exposure to libor indexed instruments and the data systems and processes that were impacted established a detailed implementation plan and developed a formal governance structure for the transition the company developed and implemented various proactive steps to facilitate the transition on behalf of customers up through december which included table start the adoption and implementation of fallback provisions that provided for the determination of replacement rates for liborlinked financial products table endtable start the adoption of new products linked to alternative reference rates such as adjustablerate mortgages consistent with guidance provided by the us regulators the alternative reference rates committee and gses table endtable start the selection of sofr indices as the replacement indices and successful completion of systems testing using the sofr replacement indices table endtable start successful transition of liborexposed instruments to sofr and other indices as appropriate for contracts that provided for a specific replacement index other than sofr table end we utilized the provisions of the adjustable interest rate libor act passed by congress and signed into law by the president in march for certain contracts referencing libor the act provides for the use of sofr as the replacement index with a spread adjustment when the remaining libor indices are discontinued the act applies when there is no contract provision addressing the loss of libor and may be used otherwise as well provided the contract does not provide for a specific replacement index in addition the company developed and implemented processes to educate clientfacing associates and coordinate communications with customers regarding the transition as of december the companys liborindexed loans derivatives and trust preferred securities have migrated to sofr and other indices asset credit risk and concentrations the quality of our interest earning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk we review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk to facilitate this review we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits documentation periodic examination and follow up in addition we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry government agency or geographic location deposit concentrations at december and we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our deposits concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us the total deposit balances held by top and deposit holders were below of the companys average total deposit balances at december and we do not have any foreign deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities taxfree securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the bank has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of our borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within our geographic footprint and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total tier capital plus regulatory adjusted allowance for credit losses of the company or billion at december based on this criteria we had eight such credit concentrations at december including loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans secured by owner occupied office buildings including medical office buildings of billion loans secured by owner occupied nonresidential buildings excluding office buildings of billion loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of billion loans secured by 1st mortgage family owner occupied residential property including condos and home equity lines of billion loans secured by jumbo original loans greater than st mortgage family owner occupied residential property of billion loans secured by business assets including accounts receivable inventory and equipment of billion and loans to consumers secured by nonreal estate of billion the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard acl methodology after the adoption of cecl in the first quarter of banking regulators established guidelines for calculating credit concentrations banking regulators set the guidelines for construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cdl concentration ratio and for total commercial real estate loans construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans to total less than of total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl cre concentration ratio both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total tier capital less modified cecl transitional amount plus acl at december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and its cre concentration ratio was at december the banks cdl concentration ratio was and its cre concentration ratio was as of december and the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these loan concentration ratios guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation unlike most other industries the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institutions performance than does the effect of inflation interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services while the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories it does have an effect during periods of high inflation there are normally corresponding increases in money supply and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets loans and deposits also general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses inflation also affects our banks customers and may result in an indirect effect on our banks business contractual obligations the following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of december longterm debt obligations totaling million include trust preferred junior subordinated debt and corporate subordinated debt operating and finance lease obligations of million and million respectively pertain to banking facilities certain lease agreements include
