financial condition and results of operations mda describes south state corporation and its subsidiarys results of operations for the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and the year ended december as compared to the year ended december and also analyzes our financial condition as of december as compared to december like most banking institutions we derive most of our income from interest we receive on our loans and investments our primary source of funds for making these loans and investments is our deposits on most of which we pay interest consequently one of the key measures of our success is the amount of net interest income or the difference between the income on our interestearning assets such as loans and investments and the expense on our interestbearing liabilities such as deposits another key measure is the spread between the yield we earn on these interestearning assets and the rate we pay on our interestbearing liabilities there are risks inherent in all loans so we maintain an allowance for loan losses to absorb our estimate of probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible we establish and maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our earnings in the following section we have included a detailed discussion of this process in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments we earn income through fees and other services we charge to our customers we incur costs in addition to interest expense on deposits and other borrowings the largest of which is salaries and employee benefits we describe the various components of this noninterest income and noninterest expense in the following discussion the following section also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial position and operating results during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with the financial statements and the related notes and the other information included in this report overview we achieved net income of million or diluted earnings per share eps during compared to net income of million or diluted eps in net income available to the common shareholders was up million or in due primarily to the following table start increased interest income of million which resulted from a million increase in interest income from loans a million increase in interest income from investment securities and a million increase in interest income on federal funds sold securities purchased under agreement to resell and interestbearing deposits interest income on nonacquired loans increased million due to both a billion increase in the average balance of such loans and a basis point increase in yield on such loans these increases were partially offset by a million decline in interest income on our acquired loan portfolio due to a billion decline in the average balance of such loans the increase in interest income from investment securities was due to both increases in average balances and increases in yields the increase in interest income from federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and interestbearing deposits was due to an increase in average balance table end table start increased interest expense of million which resulted from a million increase in the average balance of total interestbearing liabilities and a basis point increase in the cost of total interestbearing liabilities the increase in average balances was primarily due to a million increase in other borrowings the increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities was mainly due to the effect of the risinghigher interest rate environment throughout and the first half of along with growth in higher cost other borrowings in table end table start lower provision for loan losses of million which primarily resulted from a million decrease in the provision within our nonacquired loan portfolio due to lower loan growth in and our continued low amount of net chargeoffs excluding overdrafts and ready reserves reflecting continued strength in the asset quality of our portfolio this decline was partially offset by an increase in the provision for acquired noncredit impaired loans of in compared to due to an increase in loan chargeoffs in that portfolio table end table start decreased noninterest income of million which primarily resulted from a million decrease in fees on deposit accounts a million decrease in recoveries on acquired loans and a million decrease in trust and investment services income these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in mortgage table end table start banking income and a million increase in securities gains losses see noninterest income section on page for further discussion table end table start decreased noninterest expense of million which primarily resulted from a million decrease in merger and branch consolidation related expense a million decrease in fdic assessment and other regulatory charges a million decrease in occupancy expense and a million decrease in amortization of intangibles these decreases were partially offset by the addition of million of pension plan termination expense in a million increase in advertising and marketing expense a million increase in salaries and employee benefits and a million increase in other noninterest expense see noninterest expense section on page for further discussion and table end table start lower income tax provision of million due to a decline in our effective tax rate primarily as a result of additional federal and state tax credits available during compared to table end our asset quality related to nonacquired loans remained strong in at december net charge offs as a percentage of average non acquired loans for remained flat at compared to nonacquired nonperforming assets npas increased to million at december from million at december due to an increase of million in non acquired nonperforming loans npas as a percentage of nonacquired loans and repossessed assets increased five basis points to at december as compared to at december our asset quality related to the acquired loan portfolio remained stable in as net charge offs increased while npas declined at december net charge offs as a percentage of average acquired noncredit impaired loans increased five basis points to in from in acquired npas decreased slightly to million at december from million at december due to a decrease of million in nonperforming acquired noncredit impaired loans this decrease was partially offset by an increase in acquired other real estate owned oreo of the alll declined slightly to of total nonacquired loans at december compared to at december the allowance provides times coverage of nonacquired nonperforming loans at december a decrease from times coverage at december net chargeoffs as a percentage of average nonacquired loans remained flat at in compared to as net chargeoffs from the loan portfolio excluding overdrafts and ready reserves were in a net recovery position of in the continuing low amount of net chargeoffs on the nonacquired loan portfolio has driven the alll as a percentage of total nonacquired loans down our efficiency ratio improved to at december from at december the improvement in our efficiency ratio was due to the effect of the decrease in noninterest expense being greater than the effect of the decrease in the total of net interest income and noninterest income the main reason for the decline in noninterest expense was the million decrease in merger and branch consolidation expense in excluding merger and branch consolidation expenses pension plan termination expense and net gains on sale of securities our adjusted efficiency ratio nongaap was at december and at december we continue to remain wellcapitalized with a total riskbased capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of as of december compared to and respectively at december the total risk based capital ratio decreased in as total capital excluding the change in accumulated other comprehensive income or aoci declined by million or while total riskweighted assets increased million or the decline in capital was mainly due to the repurchase of  of our common stock in for a total of million and the payment of dividends to our common shareholders of million this was partially offset by net income of million the tier leverage ratio also decreased from the prior year as total capital excluding the change in aoci declined by million or while total average eligible assets increased billion or this decrease was also due to a decline in capital from our stock repurchases and our payment of the dividends we believe our current capital ratios position us well to grow both organically and through certain strategic opportunities at december we had billion in assets and full time equivalent employees through our bank we provide our customers with checking accounts now accounts savings and time deposits of various types brokerage services and alternative investment products such as annuities and mutual funds trust and asset management services business loans agriculture loans real estate loans personal use loans home improvement loans automobile loans manufactured housing loans

centerstate bank corporation proposed merger on january south state and centerstate bank corporation a florida corporation centerstate entered into an agreement and plan of merger the merger agreement pursuant to which south state and centerstate have agreed to combine their respective companies in an allstock merger of equals the merger agreement provides that upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth therein centerstate will merge with and into south state with south state continuing as the surviving entity in a transaction we refer to as the merger the merger agreement was unanimously approved by the boards of directors of south state and centerstate and is subject to shareholder and regulatory approval and other customary closing conditions under the terms of the merger agreement shareholders of centerstate will receive  of south state common stock for each share of centerstate common stock they own after the merger it is anticipated that centerstate shareholders will own approximately and south state shareholders will own approximately of the combined company the aggregate consideration including in the money outstanding stock options is valued at approximately billion based on approximately  of centerstate common stock outstanding as of december and on south states february closing stock price of the transaction is expected to close during the third quarter of at december centerstate reported billion in total assets billion in loans and billion in deposits branch consolidation and other cost initiatives in midjanuary we scheduled the closure of branch locations to occur in we closed twelve of the branches during the second quarter of and we closed the remaining branch in october we also began other costreduction initiatives during the first quarter of including the implementation of new technology and the renegotiation of contracts we estimate the annual savings from these branch closures and costreduction initiatives to be million and the net impact of these efforts in was approximately million capital management during we remained active in repurchasing shares of our common stock repurchasing  at an average price of per share excluding commission expense for a total of million in june our board of directors authorized the repurchase of an additional  of our common stock under the new repurchase program there were  available for repurchase under the new repurchase program as of december in the first quarter of we repurchased an additional  of our common stock at an average price of per share excluding cost of commission for a total of million we may repurchase up to an additional  of common stock under the repurchase program critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared based on the application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and follow general practices within the banking industry our financial position and results of operations are affected by managements application of accounting policies including estimates assumptions and judgments made to arrive at the carrying value of assets and liabilities and amounts reported for revenues and expenses differences in the application of these policies could result in material changes in our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations and related disclosures understanding our accounting policies is fundamental to understanding our consolidated financial position and consolidated results of operations accordingly our significant accounting policies and changes in accounting principles and effects of new accounting pronouncements are discussed in note of our audited consolidated financial statements the following is a summary of our critical accounting policies that are highly dependent on estimates assumptions and judgments business combinations we account for acquisitions under financial accounting standards board fasb accounting standards codification asc topic business combinations which requires the use of the acquisition method of accounting all identifiable assets acquired including loans and liabilities assumed are recorded at fair value no allowance for loan losses related to the acquired loans is recorded on the acquisition date because the fair value of the loans acquired incorporates assumptions regarding credit risk acquired creditimpaired loans are accounted for under the accounting guidance for loans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality found in fasb asc topic receivablesloans and debt securities acquired with deteriorated credit quality and initially measured at fair value which includes estimated future credit losses expected to be incurred over the life of the loans loans acquired in business combinations with evidence of credit deterioration are considered impaired loans acquired through business combinations that do not meet the specific criteria of fasb asc topic but for which a discount is attributable at least in part to credit quality are also accounted for under this guidance certain acquired loans such as lines of credit consumer and commercial and loans for which there was no discount attributable to credit are accounted for in accordance with fasb asc topic where the discount is accreted through earnings based on estimated cash flows over the estimated life of the loan for further discussion of our loan accounting and acquisitions see note 1summary of significant accounting policies note 2mergers and acquisitions and note 4loans and allowance for loan losses to the audited condensed consolidated financial statements allowance for nonacquired loan losses the allowance for loan losses reflects managements estimated losses that will result from the inability of our borrowers to make required loan payments we establish the allowance for loan losses through a provision for loan losses charged to earnings we charge loan losses against the allowance when management believes that the collectability of the principal amount of a loan is unlikely we credit subsequent recoveries if any to the allowance the allowance consists of general and specific reserves the general reserve relates to loans that are not identified as impaired we determine the general reserve by applying loss percentages to the portfolio based on historical loss experience and managements evaluation and risk grading of the loan portfolio which has a high degree of management subjectivity additionally we include in this evaluation the general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas credit quality trends collateral values loan volumes and concentrations seasoning of the loan portfolio the findings of internal and external credit reviews and results from external bank regulatory examinations the specific reserve relates to impaired loans we determine the specific reserve on a loanby loan basis based on managements evaluation of our exposure for each credit given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral management evaluates nonaccrual loans and tdrs to determine whether or not they are impaired for loans that are classified as impaired an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan we require updated appraisals on at least an annual basis for impaired loans that are collateral dependent generally the need for specific reserve is evaluated on impaired loans and once a specific reserve is established for a loan a charge off of that amount occurs in the quarter subsequent to the establishment of the specific reserve the process of determining the level of the allowance for loan losses requires a high degree of judgment it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusion allowance for acquired loan losses with the savannah bancorp sbc first financial holdings inc ffhi southeastern bank financial corporation sbfc and the park sterling corporation psc acquisitions we segregated the acquired loan portfolio into two categories i loans for which there was a discount related in part to credit acquired credit impaired loans accounted for under fasb acs topic and ii loans for which there was not a material discount attributable to credit acquired noncredit impaired loans accounted for under fasb asc topic for additional information about these classifications see business combinations above we aggregate acquired credit impaired loans in loan pools with common risk characteristics in accordance with the provisions of asc topic we estimate the cash flows expected to be collected on these based on the expected remaining life of the loans which includes the effects of estimated prepayments cash flow evaluations are inherently subjective as they require material estimates all of which may be susceptible to significant change we will perform reestimations of cash flows on these loan pools on a quarterly basis any decline in expected cash flows as a result of these reestimations due in any part to a change in credit is deemed credit impairment and recorded as provision for loan losses during the period any decline in expected cash flows due only to changes in expected timing of cash flows is recognized prospectively as a decrease in yield on the loan and any improvement in expected cash flows once any previously recorded impairment is recaptured is recognized prospectively as an adjustment to the yield on the loan probable and significant increases in cash flows in a loan pool where an allowance for acquired loan losses was previously recorded reduces the remaining allowance for acquired loan losses before recalculating the amount of accretable yield percentage for the loan pool in accordance with fasb asc topic we account for acquired noncredit impaired loans on an individual basis the allowance for loan losses on acquired noncredit impaired loans is measured and recorded consistent with our nonacquired loans other real estate owned oreo we report oreo consisting of properties obtained through foreclosure or through a deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of loans at the lower of cost or fair value determined on the basis of current valuations obtained principally from independent sources adjusted for estimated selling costs at the time of foreclosure or initial possession of collateral any excess of the loan balance over the fair value of the real estate held as collateral is treated as a charge against the allowance for loan losses we record subsequent declines in the fair value of oreo below the new cost basis through valuation adjustments significant judgments and complex estimates are required in estimating the fair value of other real estate and the period of time within which such estimates can be considered current is significantly shortened during periods of market volatility in response to market conditions and other economic factors management may utilize liquidation sales as part of its problem asset disposition strategy as a result of the significant judgments required in estimating fair value and the variables involved in different methods of disposition the net proceeds realized from sales transactions could differ significantly from the current valuations used to determine the fair value of oreo management reviews the value of oreo periodically and adjusts the values as appropriate revenue and expenses from oreo operations as well as gains or losses on sales and any subsequent adjustments to the value are recorded as oreo expense and loan related expense a component of noninterest expense goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the sum of the estimated fair values of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired less the estimated fair value of the liabilities assumed goodwill has an indefinite useful life and is evaluated for impairment annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value the goodwill impairment analysis is a two step test the first step used to identify potential impairment involves comparing each reporting units estimated fair value to its carrying value including goodwill if the estimated fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value goodwill is considered not to be impaired if the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value there is an indication of potential impairment and the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment if required the second step involves calculating an implied fair value of goodwill for each reporting unit for which the first step indicated impairment the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in a manner similar to the amount of goodwill calculated in a business combination by measuring the excess of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit as determined in the first step over the aggregate estimated fair values of the individual assets liabilities and identifiable intangibles as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination if the implied fair value of goodwill exceeds the carrying value of goodwill assigned to the reporting unit there is no impairment if the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill an impairment charge is recorded for the excess an impairment loss cannot exceed the carrying value of goodwill assigned to a reporting unit and the loss establishes a new basis in the goodwill subsequent reversal of goodwill impairment losses is not permitted we evaluated the carrying value of goodwill as of april our annual test date and determined that no impairment charge was necessary our stock price has historically traded above its book value and tangible book value at december our stock price was which was above book value of and tangible book value of based on the updated analysis of goodwill as of april and the fact that our stock price has traded above book value during the third and fourth quarter of we believe there is no impairment of goodwill as of december should our future earnings and cash flows decline discount rates increase andor the market value of our stock decreases an impairment charge to goodwill and other intangible assets may be required core deposit intangibles client list intangibles and noncompetition noncompete intangibles consist of costs that resulted from the acquisition of other banks from other financial institutions core deposit intangibles represent the estimated value of long term deposit relationships acquired in these transactions client list intangibles represent the value of long term client relationships for the wealth and trust management business noncompete intangibles represent the value of key personnel relative to various competitive factors such as ability to compete willingness or likelihood to compete and feasibility based upon the competitive environment and what the bank could lose from competition these costs are amortized over the estimated useful lives such as deposit accounts in the case of core deposit intangible on a method that we believe reasonably approximates the anticipated benefit stream from this intangible the estimated useful lives are periodically reviewed for reasonableness income taxes and deferred tax assets income taxes are provided for the tax effects of the transactions reported in our condensed consolidated financial statements and consist of taxes currently due plus deferred taxes related to differences between the tax basis and accounting basis of certain assets and liabilities including availableforsale securities allowance for loan losses write downs of oreo properties accumulated depreciation net operating loss carry forwards accretion income deferred compensation intangible assets mortgage servicing rights and pension plan and post retirement benefits the deferred tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences which will either be taxable or deductible when the assets and liabilities are recovered or settled deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected at income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be realized or settled a valuation allowance is recorded in situations where it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset is not realizable as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes the company and its subsidiaries file a consolidated federal income tax return additionally income tax returns are filed by the company or its subsidiaries in the state of south carolina georgia north carolina florida virginia alabama and mississippi we evaluate the need for income tax reserves related to uncertain income tax positions but had no material reserves at december or on december the tax reform act was signed into law and includes numerous provisions that impact us most notably a reduction in the corporate tax rate from the prior maximum rate of to a flat rate of as a result we revalued our deferred tax assets and liabilities during which resulted in south state recording a noncash increase to income tax expense of million while we took significant efforts to estimate the impact of this revaluation in additional refinement was required during to finalize the revaluation we recorded a tax benefit of as a result of additional revaluation refinement measurement period adjustments related to the acquisition of psc recognition of income from acquired loans and adjustments resulting from our income tax returns filed in recent accounting standards and pronouncements for information relating to recent accounting standards and pronouncements see note to our audited consolidated financial statements entitled summary of significant accounting policies results of operations consolidated net income available to common shareholders increased by million for the year ended december compared to the year ended december this increase reflects an increase in interest income a decrease in provision for loan losses a decrease in noninterest expense and a decrease in income tax expense partially offsetting these positive effects on net income was an increase in

income provision for loan losses noninterest income noninterest expense income before income taxes income taxes net income available to common shareholders earnings per share net income basic net income diluted cash dividends table end net interest income net interest income is the largest component of our net income net interest income is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets and interest paid on deposits and borrowings net interest income is determined by the yields earned on interestearning assets rates paid on interestbearing liabilities the relative balances of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities the degree of mismatch and the maturity and repricing characteristics of interestearning assets and interest bearing liabilities net interest income divided by average interestearning assets represents our net interest margin the federal reserves federal open market committees target for federal funds increased basis points in and basis points in to a range of to for the year ended december during the federal funds target rate remained at the to range until july when the federal reserve began to drop the federal funds target rate in the last half of the federal reserve dropped the federal funds target rate basis points to the range of to at december these changes in interest rates affected both our net interest income and net interest margin the yield on our nonacquired loan portfolio increased basis point in from and increased basis points in from contributing to higher interest income which had a positive effect on our net interest income and net interest margin for as compared to and as compared to we have also had to increase the rates paid on most of our deposit products in and as interest rates have increased in order to retain deposit balances as a result the cost of interestbearing deposits increased basis points in and basis points in the increase in the ratecost of interestbearing liabilities due to higher interest rates has contributed to higher interest expense which had a negative effect on our net interest income and net interest margin for as compared to and as compared to with the federal reserve dropping the federal funds target rate basis points during the last half of we have begun to see the yields on all categories of interestearning assets and costs on all categories of interestbearing liabilities decline this has had an overall negative effect on our net interest income and net interest margin in the last half of compared to net interest income and net interest margin highlighted for the year ended december compared to table start our net interest income decreased by million or to million during compared to as increases in interest income were more than offset by increases in interest expense table endtable start our interest income increased million in primarily because of a million increase in interest income on nonacquired loans a million increase in interest income from investment securities and a million increase in interest income on federal funds sold and securities purchased under agreements to resell and interestbearing deposits partially offset by a million decrease in interest income on acquired loans the increase in interest income was due primarily to both higher average balances on interestearning assets other than acquired loans and higher yields on nonacquired loans and investment securities as follows table endtable start average interestearning assets increased million or to billion in compared to the average balance of our nonacquired loan portfolio increased billion because of organic growth in addition the average balance of federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and interestbearing deposits increased million and the average balance of investment securities increased million as we had more funds to invest as a result of growth in total deposits and other borrowings these increases were partially offset by a billion decrease in the average balance of our acquired loan portfolio table endtable start the average yield on nonacquired loans increased basis points in compared to while the average yield on investment securities increased basis points each due to the higher rate environment for most of compared to as the federal reserve increased the federal funds target rate basis points from december to december table end table start overall our yield on interestearning assets in decreased ten basis points from due to a change in asset mix as the average balance of acquired loans our highest yielding asset at declined billion and the average balance of federal funds sold securities purchased under agreements to resell and interestbearing deposits our lowest yielding asset at increased million which more than offset the increased average yields and balances on our nonacquired loan portfolio and investment securities in discussed above our loan portfolio continues to remix with of the portfolio comprised of nonacquired loans and comprised of acquired loans at december compared to and respectively on december the decrease in the acquired loan portfolio as a percentage of the total loan portfolio in was due to continued payoffs chargeoffs transfers to oreo and renewals of acquired loans that are moved to our nonacquired loan portfolio table endtable start our interest expense increased million in primarily because of a million increase in deposit interest expense and an million increase in other borrowing interest expense these increases were due primarily to higher average balances of million in interestbearing deposits and higher average balances of million in other borrowings table endtable start overall the average cost of interestbearing liabilities for increased basis points from due primarily to a 23basis point increase in the cost of interestbearing deposits and a million increase in the average balance of other borrowings our highest cost interestbearing liability at the average cost of deposits increased from during to in due to the higher interest rate environment for most of compared to and because of increased competition for deposits in our markets the increase in the average balance of other borrowing was due to our strategic decision to use a longer term fhlb funding strategy to fund balance sheet growth resulting in the average balance of fhlb advances increasing million in we have borrowed million in fhlb borrowings since march to lock in longer term low cost funds table endtable start our net interest margin decreased by basis points to in compared to in our net interest margin taxable equivalent decreased by basis points to in compared to in these decreases were due mainly to the increase in the cost of interestbearing liabilities of basis points the decline in the average balance of acquired loans of billion our highest yielding asset the increase in the average balance of

other borrowings of million our highest cost interestbearing liability table endtable start the yield on interestearning assets and the cost on interestbearing liabilities began to decline during the last half of as the federal reserve bank reduced the federal funds target rate basis points during the period our interestearning assets have repriced more quickly than our interestbearing liabilities as rates have fallen during the last six months of the year causing the net interest margin to decline table end compared to net interest income and net interest margin for the year ended december compared to table start our net interest income increased by million or to million during compared to table endtable start our higher net interest income in was mainly driven by an increase in interest income due to higher balances of average interestearning assets including a billion increase in nonacquired loans a billion increase in acquired loans and a million increase in investment securities the increase in our nonacquired loan portfolio was driven by organic growth as our markets remained sound in the increase in our acquired loan portfolio and in investment securities was due to the addition of loans and investment securities acquired in our acquisition of psc in the fourth quarter of with the psc merger in the fourth quarter of we acquired billion in loans and million in investment securities after fair value marks table endtable start also driving our higher net interest income in was an increase of basis points on the yield on interest earning assets mainly due to a basis point increase in the yield on our nonacquired loan portfolio and a basis point increase in the yield on our investment portfolio these increases were partially offset by a basis point decline in the yield on our acquired loan portfolio the yield on our nonacquired loan portfolio increased mainly due to the federal reserve increasing the federal funds target rate basis points in which effectively increased the prime rate used for pricing for a majority of our variable rate loans and new nonacquired loans the increase in interest rates during was also the reason for the increase in the yield on our investment portfolio as we purchased million in new securities during in the rising rate environment the yield on our acquired loan portfolio declined due to the acquired credit impaired loans being renewed and the cash flow from these assets being extended which increase the weighted average life of the loan pools within all of our acquired loan portfolios in addition the yield on the loans acquired in the merger with psc during the fourth quarter of were lower than the yields on our existing acquired loan portfolio table endtable start our higher net interest income in was partially offset by higher interest expense of million in compared to the increase in interest expense was mainly due to higher costrates on our interest bearing liabilities as the average cost of interestbearing liabilities increase basis points to in the increase in the average rate of interestbearing liabilities was due to higher costs on all categories of interestbearing liabilities as interestbearing deposits increased basis points federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements increased basis points and other borrowings increased basis points the increase in the cost of interestbearing deposits was primarily the result of the rising rate environment with the federal reserve increasing the federal funds target rate basis points in these rate increases led to an increase in the costs of our core deposits through increased competition in our markets the increase in costs of deposits was also affected by the rates on the deposits acquired through the merger with psc being higher than the rates on our legacy deposits the increase in cost on federal funds purchased and repurchased agreement and other borrowings was also the result of the federal reserve increasing the federal funds target rate by basis points in which has increased short term borrowing rates and rates on our long term trust preferred borrowings which reprice quarterly and are tied to threemonth libor table endtable start our higher interest expense in was also driven by an increase in average interestbearing liabilities most categories of interestbearing liabilities increased in including interestbearing deposits by billion and other borrowings by million these increases were mainly due to the acquisition of psc in the fourth quarter of in which we acquired billion of interestbearing deposits and table end table start million of other borrowings after the psc acquisition we paid off million of the acquired other borrowings table endtable start our net interest margin decreased three basis points to from in our net interest margin taxable equivalent decreased six basis points to from in this was mainly due to the increase in the cost of interestbearing

has over billion in assets these decreases were partially offset by an increase in service charges on deposit accounts of million in atm income of and an increase in credit card sales income of the

for a discussion on the decline in gross interchange fees during and bankcard services income we exceeded billion in total consolidated assets upon consummation of our merger with sbfc on january banks with over billion in total assets are no longer exempt from the requirements of the federal reserves rules on interchange transaction fees for debit cards this means that beginning on july due to the durbin amendment the bank was limited to receiving only a reasonable interchange transaction fee for any debit card transactions processed using debit cards issued by the bank to our customers the federal reserve has determined that it is unreasonable for a bank with more than billion in total assets to receive more than plus basis points of the transaction plus a fraud adjustment for an interchange transaction fee for debit card transactions this reduction in the amount of interchange fees we receive for electronic debit interchange began reducing our revenues as of july as noted above bankcard income including interchange transaction fees is included in fees on deposit accounts for the years ended december and we earned approximately million and million respectively in interchange transaction fees for debit cards we estimate that bankcard service income was reduced by approximately million during the third and fourth quarters of and approximately million in due to

in the fourth quarter of and the conversion in the second quarter of the costs in were mainly related to the consolidation of branches during the year table end table start fdic assessment and other regulatory charges decreased by million or this decrease was mainly due to our receipt of our small bank assessment credit of million in from the fdic which was applied to the assessment to be paid in

the merger with psc and branch consolidations that occurred during our number of branches decreased by or from at december to at december table end table start amortization of intangibles decreased

table start amortization of intangibles increased million due to amortization of the core deposit intangible created with our merger with psc table end table start other noninterest expense increased

psc merger closed on november the merger related expenses mainly consists of change in control payments severance payments merger related incentive payments system conversion costs investment banking fees legal costs and vendor contract resolution payments table end income tax expense our effective tax rate decreased to at december compared to at december the reduced rate is primarily the result of additional federal and state tax credits available in compared to in particular one federal tax credit that closed late in the fourth quarter of totaling approximately million the impact of the tax credits was partially offset by a slight increase in pretax income over the prior year financial condition overview at december we had total assets of approximately billion consisting principally of

second quarter of we also sold certain lower yielding legacy securities mostly mortgagebacked securities at a loss and reinvested the funds in higher yielding current market securities which also consisted mostly of mortgagebacked securities the losses on the sales of securities of approximately million taken in this restructuring were offset by a gain of million that we recorded on the sale of visa class b shares at december the fair value of the total available for sale investment securities portfolio was million or above its amortized cost basis comparable valuations at december reflected a total available for sale investment portfolio fair value that was million or below its amortized cost basis the increase in fair value in the available for sale investment portfolio at december compared to december was mainly due to the decrease in interest rates in the last half of and due to our sale of certain lower yielding securities during the first and second quarters of with the proceeds reinvested in higher yielding securities when interest rates were higher than at year end heldtomaturity we did not hold any htm securities during and currently do not plan to purchase

table end table start the balance of securities available for sale represented of total assets at december and of total assets at december table endtable start interest income earned on securities in was million an increase of million or from million in resulting from a million increase in average balances and a sixbasis points increase in the yield on available for sale securities in we used a portion of our excess liquidity from growth in deposits and other borrowings to increase the size of our investment portfolio the increase in yield was mainly due to our sale of some lower yielding securities during the first and second quarters of with the proceeds reinvested in higher yielding securities when interest rates were higher than at year end table end at december we had securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position which totaled million see note 3investment securities in the consolidated financial statements for additional information the decrease in the number and the amount of loss on securities in a loss position on the available for sale investment portfolio was primarily related to the mortgagebacked securities category and was the result of the decrease in interest rates during as both short and long term interest rates declined during the year it was also due to the restructuring of the investment portfolio completed in the first and second quarters of where we sold many of the securities that were in a loss position all debt securities available for sale in an unrealized loss position as of december continue to perform as scheduled we have evaluated the cash flows and determined that all contractual cash flows should be received therefore impairment is considered temporary because we have the ability to hold these securities within the portfolio until the maturity or until the value recovers and we believe that it is not likely that we will be required to sell these securities prior to recovery as a result we do not consider these investments to be otherthantemporarily impaired at december we continue to monitor all of these securities with a high degree of scrutiny there can be no assurance that we will not conclude in future periods that conditions existing at that time indicate some or all of these securities are other than temporarily impaired which would require a charge to earnings in such periods any charges for otherthantemporary impairment related to securities available for sale would not impact cash flow tangible capital or liquidity while securities classified as available for sale may be sold from time to time to meet liquidity or other needs it is not our normal practice to trade this segment of the investment securities portfolio while we generally hold these assets on a longterm basis or until maturity any shortterm investments or securities available for sale could be sold at an earlier point depending partly on changes in interest rates and alternative investment opportunities other investments our other investment securities consist of nonmarketable equity securities that have no readily determinable market value accordingly when evaluating these securities for impairment management considers the ultimate recoverability of the par value rather than recognizing temporary declines in value as of december we determined that there was no impairment on our other investment

those loans where information about possible credit problems of the borrowers has caused management to have concern about the borrowers ability to comply with present repayment terms allowance for loan losses on december the federal reserve board the fdic and other regulatory agencies collectively revised the banking agencies policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses to ensure consistency with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states and more recent supervisory guidance our loan loss policy adheres to the interagency guidance our allowance for loan losses is based upon estimates made by management we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans that are determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of our loan portfolio arriving at the allowance involves a high degree of management judgment and results in a range of estimated losses we regularly evaluate the adequacy of the allowance through our internal risk rating system outside and internal credit review and regulatory agency examinations to assess the quality of the loan portfolio and identify problem loans the evaluation process also includes our analysis of current economic conditions composition of the loan portfolio past due and nonaccrual loans concentrations of credit lending policies and procedures and historical loan loss experience the provision for loan losses is charged to expense in an amount necessary to maintain the allowance at an appropriate level the allowance for loan losses on nonacquired loans consists of general and specific reserves the general reserves are determined by applying loss percentages to the portfolio that are based on historical loss experience for each class of loans and managements evaluation and risk grading of the loan portfolio additionally the general economic and business conditions affecting key lending areas credit quality trends collateral values loan volumes and concentrations seasoning of the loan portfolio the findings of internal and external credit reviews and results from external bank regulatory examinations are included in this evaluation currently these adjustments are applied to the nonacquired loan portfolio when estimating the level of reserve required the specific reserves are determined on a loanbyloan basis based on managements evaluation of our exposure for each credit given the current payment status of the loan and the value of any underlying collateral these are loans classified by management as doubtful or substandard for such loans that are also classified as impaired an allowance is established when the discounted cash flows or collateral value or observable market price of the impaired loan is lower than the carrying value of that loan generally the need for a specific reserve is evaluated on impaired loans and once a specific reserve is established for a loan a charge off of that amount occurs in the quarter subsequent to the establishment of the specific reserve loans that are determined to be impaired are provided a specific reserve if necessary and are excluded from the calculation of the general reserves we segregated the acquired loan portfolio into performing loans noncredit impaired and credit impaired loans the acquired noncredit impaired loans and acquired revolving type loans are accounted for under fasb asc with each loan being accounted for individually acquired noncredit impaired loans are recorded net of any acquisition accounting discounts or premiums and have no allowance for loan losses associated with them at acquisition date the related discount if applicable is accreted into interest income over the remaining contractual life of the loan using the level yield method subsequent deterioration in the credit quality of these loans is recognized by recording a provision for loan losses through the income statement increasing the acquired noncredit impaired allowance for loan losses the acquired credit impaired loans will follow the description in the next paragraph in determining the acquisition date fair value of acquired credit impaired loans and in subsequent accounting we generally aggregate purchased loans into pools of loans with common risk characteristics expected cash flows at the acquisition date in excess of the fair value of loans are recorded as interest income over the life of the loans using a level yield method if the timing and amount of the future cash flows of the pool is reasonably estimable subsequent to the acquisition date increases in cash flows over those expected at the acquisition date are recognized as interest income prospectively decreases in expected cash flows after the acquisition date are recognized by recording an allowance for loan losses evidence of credit quality deterioration for the loan pools may include information such as increased pastdue and nonaccrual levels and migration in the pools to lower loan grades the following tables provide the allocation for the nonacquired and acquired

increases in certain loan types during the period that require higher reserves from a general perspective we generally consider a threeyear historical loss rate on all loan portfolios unless circumstances within a portfolio loan type require the use of an alternate historical loss rate to better capture the risk within the portfolio we also consider qualitative factors such as economic risk model risk and operational risk when determining the alll we adjust our qualitative factors to account for uncertainty and certain risk inherent in the portfolio that cannot be measured with historical loss rates all of these factors are reviewed and adjusted each reporting period to account for managements assessment of loss within the loan portfolio overall the general reserve increased by million in compared to the balance at december the threeyear historical loss rate average on an overall basis remained consistent at one basis point when compared with december as well as with the third quarter of economic risk at the end of remained consistent and was unchanged as compared to the economic risk factor for unemployment real estate market exposure and home sales all remained consistent compared to the third quarter of there was no adjustment in the economic risk factor model risk overall declined by one basis point in compared to and was based on our external and internal review of methodology risk comes from the fact that our alll model is not allinclusive risk inherent with new products new markets and timeliness of information are examples of this type of exposure our model has been reviewed by management the audit committee and the banks primary regulators including the fdic and the scbfi and we believe it adequately addresses the various inherent risks in our loan portfolio operational risk consists of the underwriting documentation closing and servicing associated with any loan this risk is managed through policies and procedures portfolio management

stock under our repurchase programs and by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of million at december we had accumulated other comprehensive gain of million compared to an accumulated other

net of tax improvement in the unrealized gain loss position related to pension plans and a million net of tax decline in the unrealized gain loss position related to the cash flow hedges the change in the unrealized gain loss position in the available for sale securities portfolio and the cash flow hedges are due to the decline in interest rates during the change in the unrealized gain loss position in the pension plan is due to our termination of the pension plan in the second quarter of and the recognition of the unrealized loss position into net income our equitytoassets ratio decreased to at december from at december the decrease from december was due to the percentage increase in equity of being less than the percentage increase in total assets of this was mainly due to

preferred securities issued prior to may in tier capital but cannot include in tier capital any trust preferred securities issued after such date a financial institution may continue to include its trust preferred securities in tier capital if it exceeds billion in total assets through organic growth but if it exceeds billion in total assets through an acquisition or enters into an acquisition after exceeding billion in total assets through organic growth then the trust preferred securities would no longer be included in tier capital therefore upon closing on the proposed merger with

of  of common stock at a cost of million in our capital ratios are currently well in excess of the minimum standards and continue to be in the well capitalized regulatory classification we are subject to regulations with respect to certain riskbased capital ratios these riskbased capital ratios measure the relationship of capital to a combination of balance sheet and offbalance sheet risks the values of both balance sheet and offbalance sheet items are adjusted based on the rules to reflect categorical credit risk in addition to the riskbased capital ratios the regulatory agencies have also established a leverage ratio for assessing capital adequacy the leverage ratio is equal to tier capital divided by total consolidated onbalance sheet assets minus amounts deducted from tier capital the leverage ratio does not involve assigning risk weights to assets under the basel iii rules which became fully phasedin on january south state and the bank are required to maintain the following minimum capital levels a cet1 riskbased capital ratio of a tier riskbased capital ratio of a total riskbased capital ratio of and a leverage ratio of in terms of quality of capital basel iii emphasizes cet1 capital and implements strict eligibility criteria for regulatory capital instruments in addition under the basel iii rules in order to avoid restrictions on capital distributions and discretionary bonus payments to executives a covered banking organization is required to maintain a capital conservation buffer equal to of riskweighted assets in addition to its minimum riskbased capital requirements this buffer consists solely of cet1 riskbased capital and the buffer applies to all three riskbased measurements cet1 tier capital and total capital the bank is also subject to

dividends paid during the year by net income for the year liquidity liquidity refers to our ability to generate sufficient cash to meet our financial obligations which arise primarily from the withdrawal of deposits extension of credit and payment of operating expenses our asset liability management committee alco is charged with the responsibility of monitoring policies that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of our assetliability mix two critical areas of focus for alco are interest rate sensitivity and liquidity risk management we have employed our funds in a manner to provide liquidity from both assets and liabilities sufficient to meet our cash needs asset liquidity is maintained by the maturity structure of loans investment securities and other shortterm investments management has policies and procedures governing the length of time to maturity on loans and investments as reported in table less than one percent of the investment portfolio contractually matures in one year or less this segment of the portfolio consists mostly of municipal obligations along with some paydowns of mortgagebacked securities there is also an additional amount of securities that could be called or prepaid as well as expected monthly paydowns of mortgagebacked securities normally changes in the earning asset mix are of a longerterm nature and are not utilized for daytoday corporate liquidity needs our liabilities provide liquidity on a daytoday basis daily liquidity needs are met from deposit levels or from our use of federal funds purchased securities sold under agreements to repurchase interestbearing deposits at other banks and other shortterm borrowings we engage in routine activities to retain deposits intended to enhance our liquidity position these routine activities include various measures such as the following table start emphasizing relationship banking to new and existing customers where borrowers are encouraged and normally expected to maintain deposit accounts with our bank table endtable start pricing deposits including certificates of deposit at rate levels that will attract and or retain balances of deposits that will enhance our banks assetliability management and net interest margin requirements and table endtable start continually working to identify and introduce new products that will attract

at december the acquired loan portfolio decreased by million or from the balance at december through principal paydowns chargeoffs foreclosures and renewals of acquired loans that moved into our nonacquired loan portfolio our investment securities portfolio increased million in compared to the balance at december as a result of our purchases of million of investment securities as well as improvements in the market value of the portfolio of million partially offset by maturities calls and paydowns of investment securities totaling million and sales totaling million during n et amortization of premiums was million during we increased our investment securities strategically with the excess funds from deposit growth and the increase in other borrowings in in the first and second quarter of we also sold certain lower yielding legacy securities mostly mortgagebacked securities at a loss and reinvested the funds in higher yielding current market securities which also consisted mostly of mortgagebacked securities the losses on the sales of securities of approximately million taken in this restructuring were offset by a gain of million that we recorded on the sale of visa class b shares total cash and cash equivalents was million at december compared to million at december we borrowed an additional million in fhlb advances in as well as total deposits increased million which improved liquidity in at december and december we had and million respectively of traditional outofmarket brokered deposits and million and million respectively of reciprocal brokered deposits total deposits were billion at december up million or from billion at december our deposit growth since december included a million increase in demand deposit accounts a million increase in savings and money market accounts and a million increase in interestbearing transaction accounts partially offset by a million decline in certificates of deposit other borrowings increased million to million at december compared to other borrowings at december included million in fhlb advances compared to million at december we had approximately million in junior subordinated debt at december and december during the first quarter of we paidoff early the fhlb advance of million that was outstanding at december that would have matured in december we then borrowed million in march and million in june in 90day fixed rate fhlb advances which we currently plan to continuously renew at the same time we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a notional amount of million year agreement and million year agreement to manage the interest rate risk related to these 90day fhlb advances to the extent that we employ other types of nondeposit funding sources typically to accommodate retail and correspondent customers we continue to take in occasional shorter maturities of such funds our current approach may provide an opportunity to sustain a low funding rate or possibly lower our cost of funds but could also increase our cost of funds if interest rates rise our ongoing philosophy is to remain in a liquid position as reflected by such indicators as the composition of our earning assets typically including some level of reverse repurchase agreements federal funds sold balances at the federal reserve bank andor other shortterm investments asset quality wellcapitalized position and profitable operating results cyclical and other economic trends and conditions can disrupt our desired liquidity position at any time we expect that these conditions would generally be of a shortterm nature under such circumstances we expect our reverse repurchase agreements and federal funds sold positions or balances at the federal reserve bank if any to serve as the primary source of immediate liquidity at december we had total federal funds credit lines of million with no outstanding advances if we needed additional liquidity we would turn to shortterm borrowings as an alternative immediate funding source and would consider other appropriate actions such as promotions to increase core deposits or the sale of a portion of our investment portfolio at december we had million of credit available at the federal reserve banks discount window but had no outstanding advances as of the end of in addition we could draw on additional alternative immediate funding sources from lines of credit extended to us from our correspondent banks andor the fhlb at december we had a total fhlb credit facility of billion with million in outstanding advances in credit enhancements from participation in the fhlbs mortgage partnership finance program and outstanding fhlb letters of credit to secure certain public funds deposits of million leaving billion in availability on the fhlb credit facility we have a million unsecured line of credit with us bank national association with no outstanding advances we believe that our liquidity position continues to be adequate and readily available our contingency funding plan describes several potential stages based on stressed liquidity levels our board of directors reviews liquidity benchmarks quarterly we also review on at least an annual basis our liquidity position and our contingency funding plans with our principal banking regulators we maintain various wholesale sources of funding if our deposit retention efforts were to be unsuccessful we would utilize these alternative sources of funding under such circumstances depending on the external source of funds our interest cost would vary based on the range of interest rates charged this could increase our cost of funds impacting our net interest margin and net interest spread derivatives and securities held for trading the sec has adopted rules that require comprehensive disclosure of accounting policies for derivatives as well as enhanced quantitative and qualitative disclosures of market risk for derivatives and other financial instruments the market risk disclosures are classified into two categories financial instruments entered into for trading purposes and all other instruments nontrading purposes we do not maintain a derivatives or securities trading portfolio assetliability management and market risk sensitivity our earnings and the economic value of our shareholders equity may vary in relation to changes in interest rates and the accompanying fluctuations in market prices of certain of our financial instruments we use a number of methods to measure interest rate risk including simulating the effect on earnings of fluctuations in interest rates and monitoring the present value of asset and liability portfolios under various interest rate scenarios the earnings simulation models take into account our contractual agreements with regard to investments loans deposits borrowings and derivatives while the simulation models are subject to the accuracy of the assumptions that underlie the process we believe that such modeling provides a better illustration of the interest sensitivity of earnings than does a static or even a betaadjusted interest rate sensitivity gap analysis the simulation models assist in measuring and achieving growth in net interest income by providing the asset liability management committee alco a reasonable basis for quantifying and managing interest rate risk numerous simulations incorporate an array of interest rate changes as well as projected changes in the mix and volume of balance sheet assets and liabilities accordingly the simulations are considered to provide a measurement of the degree of earnings risk we have or may incur in future periods arising from interest rate changes or other market risk factors from timetotime we enter into interest rate swaps to hedge some of our interest rate risks for further discussion of the companys interest rate swaps see note 27derivative financial instruments in the consolidated financial statements our primary management tool and policy established by alco and the board of directors is to monitor exposure to interest rate increases and decreases of basis points instantaneously our policy guideline prescribes as the maximum negative impact on net interest income over a oneyear horizon associated with an instantaneous change in interest rates of basis points our principal simulation also uses a strategy or dynamic balance sheet that forecasts growth not a static or frozen balance sheet we traditionally have maintained a risk position well within the policy guideline level as of december the earnings simulations indicated that the impact of a basis point increase decrease in rates would result in an estimated increase up and decrease down in net interest income as compared with a flat base case interest rate environment these simulations in declining rate scenarios of larger magnitude are viewed by us and many other depository institutions as being more remote and not as meaningful we consider smaller declining rate scenarios in our overall analysis which also illustrate that we are asset sensitive current simulations indicate that our rate sensitivity is somewhat asset sensitive to the indicated changes in interest rates over an oneyear horizon comparatively as of december the earnings simulations indicated that the impact of an instantaneous basis point increase in rates would have resulted in an approximate increase in net interest incomeas compared with a base case interest rate environment the shape and nonparallel shifts of the fixed income yield curve can also influence interest rate risk sensitivity therefore we run a number of other rate scenario simulations to provide additional assessments of our interest rate risk posture for example in our strategy balance sheet analysis at december we simulated a curve that flattens with shortterm rates rising by approximately basis points with other rates beyond that point rising proportionally to a level that matches the december 30year yield this resulted in estimated net interest income increasing somewhat from a base case this is largely attributable to our position in short term assets rising quickly in yield a simulation of a curve that steepened caused by a basis points rise in 30year yields and then sloping downward proportionally to the current onemonth rate would have estimated results that were slightly more beneficial to net interest income as deposit rates would rise only modestly and longerterm loan yields like mortgages would increase in addition to simulation analysis we use economic value of equity eve analysis as an indicator of the extent to which the present value of our capital could change given potential changes in interest rates this measure assumes no growth or decline in the balance sheet no management influence but does assume mortgage related prepayments and certain other cash flows occur it provides a measure of rate risk extending beyond the analysis horizon contained in the simulation analyses the eve model is essentially a discounted cash flow fair value of all of the companys tangible assets liabilities and derivatives the difference represented by the present value of tangible assets minus the present value of liabilities is defined as the economic value of equity at december the companys ratio of evetoassets was in a current forward rate curve in hypothetical environments where rates increased decreased by basis points instantaneously the ratio was up and down asset credit risk and concentrations the quality of our interestearning assets is maintained through our management of certain concentrations of credit risk we review each individual earning asset including investment securities and loans for credit risk to facilitate this review we have established credit and investment policies that include credit limits documentation periodic examination and followup in addition we examine these portfolios for exposure to concentration in any one industry government agency or geographic location loan and deposit concentration we have no material concentration of deposits from any single customer or group of customers we have no significant portion of our loans concentrated within a single industry or group of related industries furthermore we attempt to avoid making loans that in an aggregate amount exceed of total loans to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities at december and there were no aggregated loan concentrations of this type we do not believe there are any material seasonal factors that would have a material adverse effect on us we do not have foreign loans or deposits concentration of credit risk each category of earning assets has a certain degree of credit risk we use various techniques to measure credit risk credit risk in the investment portfolio can be measured through bond ratings published by independent agencies in the investment securities portfolio the investments consist of us governmentsponsored entity securities taxfree securities or other securities having ratings of aaa to not rated all securities with the exception of those that are not rated were rated by at least one of the nationally recognized statistical rating organizations the credit risk of the loan portfolio can be measured by historical experience we maintain our loan portfolio in accordance with credit policies that we have established although the subsidiary has a diversified loan portfolio a substantial portion of their borrowers abilities to honor their contracts is dependent upon economic conditions within south carolina north carolina georgia and the surrounding regions we consider concentrations of credit to exist when pursuant to regulatory guidelines the amounts loaned to a multiple number of borrowers engaged in similar business activities which would cause them to be similarly impacted by general economic conditions represents of total riskbased capital or million at december based on this criteria we had four such credit concentrations at december including loans on hotels and motels of million loans to lessors of nonresidential buildings except miniwarehouses of billion loans on owner occupied office buildings of million and loans to lessors of residential buildings investment properties and multifamily of million the risk for these loans and for all loans is managed collectively through the use of credit underwriting practices developed and updated over time the loss estimate for these loans is determined using our standard alll methodology banking regulators have established guidelines for the construction land development and other land loans to total less than of total riskbased capital and for total commercial real estate loans to total less than of total riskbased capital both ratios are calculated by dividing certain types of loan balances for each of the two categories by the banks total riskbased capital at december and december the banks construction land development and other land loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and respectively commercial real estate loans which includes construction land development and other land loans along with other nonowner occupied commercial real estate and multifamily loans as a percentage of total riskbased capital were and as of december and december respectively as of december and december the bank was below the established regulatory guidelines when a banks ratios are in excess of one or both of these commercial real estate loan ratio guidelines banking regulators generally require an increased level of monitoring in these lending areas by bank management therefore we monitor these two ratios as part of our concentration management processes offbalance sheet arrangements through the operations of our bank we have made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of our business activities these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to our customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time we evaluate each customers credit worthiness on a casebycase basis the amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by us upon extension of credit is based on our credit evaluation of the borrower collateral varies but may include accounts receivable inventory property plant and equipment commercial and residential real estate we manage the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes at december the bank had issued commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit and financial guarantees of billion through various types of lending arrangements we believe that we have adequate sources of liquidity to fund commitments that are drawn upon by the borrowers in addition to commitments to extend credit we also issue standby letters of credit which are assurances to third parties that they will not suffer a loss if our customer fails to meet its contractual obligation to the third party standby letters of credit totaled million at december past experience indicates that many of these standby letters of credit will expire unused however through our various sources of liquidity we believe that we will have the necessary resources to meet these obligations should the need arise except as disclosed in this report we are not involved in offbalance sheet contractual relationships unconsolidated related entities that have offbalance sheet arrangements or transactions that could result in liquidity needs or other commitments that significantly impact earnings effect of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require the measure of financial position and results of operations in terms of historical dollars without consideration of changes in the relative purchasing power over time due to inflation unlike most other industries the majority of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates generally have a more significant effect on a financial institutions performance than does the effect of inflation interest rates do not necessarily change in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services while the effect of inflation on banks is normally not as significant as is its influence on those businesses which have large investments in plant and inventories it does have an effect during periods of high inflation there are normally corresponding increases in money supply and banks will normally experience above average growth in assets loans and deposits also general increases in the prices of goods and services will result in increased operating expenses inflation also affects our banks customers and may result in an indirect effect on our banks business contractual obligations the following table presents payment schedules for certain of our contractual obligations as of december longterm debt obligations
