item risk factors table end an investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business the material risks and uncertainties that management believes may affect valley are described below before making an investment decision you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing valley additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that management currently believes are immaterial may also impair valleys business operations the value or market price of our securities could decline due to any of these identified or other risks and you could lose all or part of your investment this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors we may fail to realize all of the anticipated benefits of the oritani merger the success of our merger with oritani which was completed in the fourth quarter will depend in part on valleys ability to realize anticipated cost savings and to combine the businesses of valley and oritani in a manner that permits growth opportunities to be realized and does not materially disrupt the existing customer relationships of oritani nor result in decreased revenues due to any loss of customers however to realize these anticipated benefits the businesses of valley and oritani must be successfully combined if the combined company is not able to achieve these objectives the anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all or may take longer to realize than expected the anticipated cost savings from the merger are largely expected to derive from the closure of certain valley or oritani branches and from the absorption by valley of many of oritanis backoffice administrative functions and the conversion of oritanis operating platform to valleys systems valley completed the conversion of oritanis operating platform and closed of the acquired branch offices during february however some normal postsystems integration matters involving backoffice and other functions as well as further planned branch consolidation efforts were still underway at the filing date of this report another expected benefit from the merger is an expected increase in the revenues of the combined company from anticipated sales of valleys wider variety of financial products and from increased lending out of valleys substantially larger capital base to oritanis existing customers and to new customers in oritanis market area who may be attracted by the combined companys enhanced offerings an inability to successfully market valleys products to oritanis customer base could cause the earnings of the combined company to be less than anticipated changes in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and earnings valleys earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon its net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interestearning assets such as loans and investment securities and interest expense paid on table start form 10k table end interestbearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds interest rates are sensitive to many factors that are beyond valleys control including general economic conditions competition and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and in particular the policies of the frb changes in interest rates driven by such factors could influence not only the interest valley receives on loans and investment securities and the amount of interest it pays on deposits and borrowings but such changes could also affect i valleys ability to originate loans and obtain deposits ii the fair value of valleys financial assets including the held to maturity and available for sale investment securities portfolios and iii the average duration of valleys interestearning assets and liabilities this also includes the risk that interestearning assets may be more responsive to changes in interest rates than interestbearing liabilities or vice versa repricing risk the risk that the individual interest rates or rate indices underlying various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities may not change in the same degree over a given time period basis risk and the risk of changing interest rate relationships across the spectrum of interestearning asset and interestbearing liability maturities yield curve risk any substantial or unexpected change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on valleys financial condition and results of operations see additional information in the net interest income and interest rate sensitivity sections of our mda our financial results and condition may be adversely impacted by changing economic conditions financial institutions can be affected by changing conditions in the real estate and financial markets weak economic conditions could result in financial stress on our borrowers that would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations volatility in the housing markets real estate values and unemployment levels could result in significant writedowns of asset values by financial institutions the majority of valleys lending is in northern and central new jersey the new york city metropolitan area florida and alabama as a result of this geographic concentration a significant broadbased deterioration in economic conditions in these areas could have a material adverse impact on the quality of valleys loan portfolio results of operations and future growth potential adverse economic conditions in our market areas can reduce our rate of growth affect our customers ability to repay loans and adversely impact our financial condition and earnings general economic conditions including inflation unemployment and money supply fluctuations also may adversely affect our profitability our business financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected by the outbreak of pandemic disease acts of terrorism and other external events the emergence of widespread health emergencies or pandemics such as the potential spread of the coronavirus could lead to regional quarantines business shutdowns labor shortages disruptions to supply chains and overall economic instability additionally new york city and new jersey remain central targets for potential acts of terrorism against the united states such events could affect the stability of our deposit base impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans impair the value of collateral securing loans cause significant property damage result in loss of revenue andor cause us to incur additional expenses although we have established and regularly test disaster recovery policies and procedures the occurrence of any such event in the future could have a material adverse effect on our business which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations our investments in certain taxadvantaged projects may not generate returns as anticipated and may have an adverse impact on our results of operations we invest in certain taxadvantaged investments that support qualified affordable housing projects community development and prior to renewable energy resources our investments in these projects are designed to generate a return primarily through the realization of federal and state income tax credits and other tax benefits over specified time periods third parties perform diligence on these investments for us on which we rely both at inception and on an ongoing basis we are subject to the risk that previously recorded tax credits which remain subject to recapture by taxing authorities based on compliance features required to be met at the project level may fail to meet certain government compliance requirements and may not be able to be realized the possible inability to realize these tax credits and other tax benefits may have a negative impact on our financial results the risk of not being able to realize the tax credits and other tax benefits depends on many factors outside our control including changes in the applicable tax code and the ability of the projects to be completed we previously invested in mobile solar generators sold and leased back by dc solar and its affiliates dc solar dc solar had its assets frozen in december by the us department of justice dc solar and related entities are in chapter bankruptcy a group of investors who purchased mobile solar generators from and leased them back to dc solar including us received tax credits for making these renewable resource investments during the fourth quarter several of the coconspirators pleaded guilty to fraud in the ongoing federal investigation based upon this new information valley deemed that its tax positions related to the dc solar funds did not meet the more likely than not recognition threshold in valleys tax reserve assessment at december as a result our net income for the year ended december included an increase to our provision for income taxes of million reflecting the reserve for uncertain tax liability positions related to tax credits and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the dc solar funds plus interest the principals pled guilty to fraud in early table start form 10k table end while we believe that valley was fully reserved for the tax positions related to dc solar at december we continue to evaluate all our existing tax positions each quarter under us gaap if we are required to recognize an increase to our uncertain tax position liability in our consolidated financial statements the resulting charge to income tax expense may have an adverse impact on our results of operations and financial condition the replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate may have an impact on valleys business financial condition or results of operations on july the financial conduct authority fca a regulator of financial services firms in the united kingdom announced that it intends to stop persuading or compelling banks to submit libor rates after the fca and the submitting libor banks have indicated they will support the libor indices through to allow for an orderly transition to an alternative reference rate in the united states efforts to identify a set of alternative us dollar reference interest rates include proposals by the alternative reference rates committee of the frb other financial services regulators and industry groups are evaluating the phaseout of libor and the development of alternate reference rate indices or reference rates many of valleys assets and liabilities are indexed to libor we are evaluating the impact of the possible replacement of the libor benchmark interest rate and whether the alternative rates the frb expects to publish will become market benchmarks in place of libor or what the impact of such a transition will have on valleys business financial condition or results of operations the proposed secured overnight financing rate sofr is a near riskfree rate whereas libor is credit related the future impact of changes to the internal revenue code is uncertain and may adversely affect our business the us congress passed significant reform of the internal revenue code known as the tax cuts and jobs act of tax act at the end of while the decline in the federal corporate tax rate from percent to percent lowered valleys income tax expense as a percentage of its taxable income in and other provisions of the tax act negatively impacted valleys consolidated financial statements and it may adversely affect valley in the future for example under the new provisions of the tax act the million and million of the banks total fdic insurance assessment for the years ended december and respectively was nontax deductible based upon the asset size of the bank the tax act also imposes limitations for individuals on the deductibility of interest and property tax expenses which may adversely impact the property values of real estate used to secure loans and create an additional tax burden for many borrowers particularly in high tax jurisdictions such as new jersey and new york where valley operates these and other federal tax changes could significantly impact the level of lending activity and the financial health of our customers the negative impact to customers could potentially result in among other things an inability to repay loans or maintain deposits at valley in states where valley operates especially new york and new jersey any negative financial impact to our customers resulting from tax reform could adversely impact our financial condition and earnings the future impact of the tax act or subsequent amendments to the tax rates and laws on our business and our customers may be adverse claims and litigation could result in significant expenses losses and damage to our reputation from time to time as part of valleys normal course of business customers bankruptcy trustees former customers contractual counterparties third parties and current and former employees make claims and take legal action against valley based on actions or inactions of valley if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to valley they may result in financial liability andor adversely affect the market perception of valley and its products and services this may also impact customer demand for valleys products and services any financial liability could have a material adverse effect on valleys financial condition and results of operations any reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on valleys business cyberattacks could compromise our information or result in the data of our customers being improperly divulged which could expose us to liability losses and escalating operating costs valley regularly collects processes transmits and stores confidential information regarding its customers employees and others for whom it services loans in some cases this confidential or proprietary information is collected compiled processed transmitted or stored by third parties on valleys behalf information security risks have increased because of the proliferation of new technologies and the increased sophistication and activities of perpetrators of cyberattacks many financial institutions and companies engaged in data processing have reported significant breaches in the security of their websites or other systems some of which have involved sophisticated and targeted attacks intended to obtain unauthorized access to confidential information destroy data denialofservice or sabotage systems often through the introduction of computer viruses or malware cyberattacks and other means although valley frequently experiences attempted cybersecurity attacks against its systems to date none of these incidents have resulted in material losses known breaches of customer data or significant disruption of services to valleys customers however there can be no assurance that valley will not incur such issues in the future exposing us to significant ongoing operational costs and reputational harm table start form 10k table end additionally risk exposure to cyber security matters will remain elevated or increase in the future due to among other things the increasing size and prominence of valley in the financial services industry our expansion of internet and mobile banking tools and products based on customer needs and the system and customer account conversions associated with the integration of merger targets in managing our cyber risks when entering a new vendor relationship we review and gage the cyber security risk of such thirdparty service providers a successful attack on one of our thirdparty service providers could adversely affect our business and result in the disclosure or misuse of our confidential information while we believe we are taking reasonable riskbased precautions to manage the risk of cyberattacks against thirdparty service providers there can be no assurance that our thirdparty service providers will not suffer a cyberattack that exposes us to significant operational costs and damages while we believe we have risk based technology reasonably capable of discovering cyberattacks and personnel who are qualified to monitor our technology and systems to detect cyberattacks we can offer no assurance that we will be able to identify and prevent cyberattacks when they occur significant damage may occur if valley fails to identify or there is a delay in identifying a cyberattack on our systems or those of our thirdparty service providers a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate and events that negatively impact the real estate market could adversely affect our asset quality and profitability for those loans secured by real property and increase the number of defaults and the level of losses within our loan portfolio a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real estate as of december approximately percent of our total loans had real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral the real estate collateral in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and could deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended a downturn in the real estate market in our primary market areas could result in an increase in the number of borrowers who default on their loans and a reduction in the value of the collateral securing their loans which in turn could have an adverse effect on our profitability and asset quality if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values our earnings and shareholders equity could be adversely affected the declines in home or commercial real estate prices in the new jersey new york and florida markets we primarily serve along with the reduced availability of mortgage credit also may result in increases in delinquencies and losses in our loan portfolios unexpected decreases in home or commercial real estate prices coupled with slow economic growth and elevated levels of unemployment could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses in that event our earnings could be adversely affected the secondary market for residential mortgage loans for the most part is limited to conforming fannie mae and freddie mac loans the effects of this limited mortgage market combined with another correction in residential real estate market prices and reduced levels of home sales could result in price reductions in home values adversely affecting the value of collateral securing mortgage loans held mortgage loan originations and gains on sale of mortgage loans declines in real estate values and home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of job losses or other factors could have further adverse effects on borrowers that result in higher delinquencies and greater chargeoffs in future periods which could adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations for additional risks related to our sales of residential mortgages in the secondary market see the we may incur future losses in connection with repurchases and indemnification payments related to mortgages that we have sold into the secondary market risk factor below net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans are a significant component of our noninterest income and could fluctuate in future periods net gains on sales of residential mortgage loans represented approximately percent and percent of our noninterest income for the years ended december and respectively our ability or decision to sell a portion of our mortgage loan production in the secondary market is dependent upon amongst other factors the levels of market interest rates consumer demand marketable loans our sales and pricing strategies the economy and our need to maintain the appropriate level of interest rate risk on our balance sheet a change in one or more of these or other factors could significantly impact our ability to sell mortgage loans in the future and adversely impact the level of our noninterest income and financial results our adoption of the cecl model for determining our allowance for credit losses expected to increase the level of our allowance and could add significant volatility to our provision for credit losses and earnings effective january valley adopted the fasbs new accounting guidance on the impairment of financial instruments commonly known as the current expected credit loss cecl model the cecl model requires the allowance for credit losses for certain financial assets including loans held to maturity securities and certain offbalance sheet credit exposures to be calculated based on current expected credit losses over the lives of the assets rather than incurred losses as of a point in time the adoption of the cecl model is anticipated to increase our allowance for credit losses which may have a material negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations actual allowance for credit losses may be materially different than table start form 10k table end the amounts reported due to the inherent uncertainty in the estimation process including future loss estimates based upon reasonable and supportable economic forecasts also future amount could differ materially from those estimates due to changes in values and circumstances after the balance sheet date see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the impact of the adoption of the cecl model higher chargeoffs and weak credit conditions could require us to increase our allowance for credit losses through a provision charge to earnings the process for determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is critical to our financial results and conditions it requires difficult subjective and complex judgments about the future including the impact of national and regional economic conditions on the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans if our judgment proves to be incorrect our allowance for credit losses may not be sufficient to cover losses inherent in our loan and investment portfolios deterioration in economic conditions affecting borrowers new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problem loans and other factors both within and outside of our control may require an increase in the allowance for credit losses additionally bank regulators review the classification of our loans in their examination of us and we may be required in the future to change the internal classification on certain loans which may require us to increase our provision for credit losses or loan chargeoffs if actual net chargeoffs were to exceed valleys allowance its earnings would be negatively impacted by additional provisions for credit losses any increase in our allowance for credit losses or loan chargeoffs as required by the occ or otherwise could have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition an increase in our nonperforming assets may reduce our interest income and increase our net loan chargeoffs provision for loan losses and operating expenses our nonaccrual loans increased from percent of total loans at december to percent of total loans at december largely due to a significant increase in nonaccrual taxi medallion loans within our commercial and industrial loan portfolio since while most of the taxi medallion loans are currently performing to their contractual terms continued negative trends in the market valuations of the underlying taxi medallion collateral caused by ridesharing services could impact the future performance of such loans the level of our loan chargeoffs and the provision for credit losses additionally a downturn in economic or real estate market conditions could result in increased chargeoffs to our allowance for credit losses and lost interest income relating to nonperforming loans nonperforming assets including nonaccrual loans other real estate owned and other repossessed assets totaled million at december these nonperforming assets can adversely affect our net income mainly through decreased interest income and increased operating expenses incurred to maintain such assets or loss charges related to subsequent declines in the estimated fair value of foreclosed assets adverse changes in the value of our nonperforming assets or the underlying collateral or in the borrowers performance or financial conditions could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition there can be no assurance that we will not experience increases in nonperforming loans in the future or that our nonperforming assets will not result in lower financial returns in the future the loss of or decrease in lowercost funding sources within our deposit base including our inability to achieve deposit retention targets under our branch transformation strategy may adversely impact our net interest income and net income checking and savings now and money market deposit account balances and other forms of customer deposits can decrease when customers perceive alternative investments such as the stock market or money market or fixed income mutual funds as providing a better riskreturn tradeoff additionally our customers largely bank with us because of our local customer service and convenience for a certain percentage customers this convenience could be negatively impacted by recent branch consolidation activity undergone as part of our branch transformation strategy if customers move money out of bank deposits and into other investments valley could lose a low cost source of funds increasing its funding costs and reducing valleys net interest income and net income we may not be able to detect money laundering and other illegal or improper activities fully or on a timely basis which could expose us to additional liability and could have a material adverse effect on us we are required to comply with antimoney laundering antiterrorism and other laws and regulations in the united states these laws and regulations require us among other things to adopt and enforce knowyourcustomer policies and procedures and to report suspicious and large transactions to applicable regulatory authorities these laws and regulations have become increasingly complex and detailed require improved systems and sophisticated monitoring and compliance personnel and have become the subject of enhanced government supervision while we have adopted policies and procedures aimed at detecting and preventing the use of our banking network for money laundering and related activities those policies and procedures may not completely eliminate instances in which we may be used by customers to engage in money laundering and other illegal or improper activities to the extent we fail to fully comply with table start form 10k table end applicable laws and regulations the occ along with other banking agencies have the authority to impose fines and other penalties and sanctions on us in addition our business and reputation could suffer if customers use our banking network for money laundering or illegal or improper purposes our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented which may result in a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition management periodically reviews and updates our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of the controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we could incur future goodwill impairment if our estimates of the fair value of our goodwill change as a result of changes in our business or other factors we may determine a goodwill impairment charge is necessary estimates of the fair value of goodwill are determined using several factors and assumptions including but not limited to industry pricing multiples and estimated cash flows based upon valleys goodwill impairment testing the fair values of its four reporting units wealth management consumer lending commercial lending and investment management were in excess of their carrying values however due to lower yields on our investment portfolio and reinvestment of normal repayments from investment securities into new loan originations our investment management segment experienced downward pressure on its fair value while not expected at this time we may be required to record a charge to earnings should there be a deficiency in our estimated fair value of the investment management and other reporting units during our subsequent impairment tests no assurance can be given that we will not record an impairment loss on goodwill in the future and any such impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition at december our goodwill totaled billion see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information we may reduce or eliminate the cash dividend on our common stock which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock holders of our common stock are only entitled to receive such cash dividends as our board of directors may declare out of funds legally available for such payments although we have historically declared cash dividends on our common stock we are not required to do so and may reduce or eliminate our common stock cash dividend in the future depending upon our results of operations financial condition or other metrics this could adversely affect the market price of our common stock additionally as a bank holding company our ability to declare and pay dividends is dependent on federal regulatory policies and regulations including the supervisory policies and guidelines of the occ and the frb regarding capital adequacy and dividends among other things consultation of the frb supervisory staff is required in advance of our declaration or payment of a dividend that exceeds our earnings for a fourquarter period in which the dividend is being paid if our subsidiaries are unable to pay dividends or make distributions to us we may be unable to make dividend payments to our preferred and common shareholders or interest payments on our longterm borrowings and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts we are a separate and distinct legal entity from our banking and nonbanking subsidiaries and depend on dividends distributions and other payments from the bank and its nonbanking subsidiaries to fund cash dividend payments on our preferred and common stock and to fund most payments on our other obligations regulations relating to capital requirements affect the ability of the bank to pay dividends and other distributions to us and to make loans to us additionally if our subsidiaries earnings are not sufficient to make dividend payments to us while maintaining adequate capital levels we may not be able to make dividend payments to our preferred and common shareholders or interest payments on our longterm borrowings and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts furthermore our right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiarys liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiarys creditors extensive regulation and supervision have a negative impact on our ability to compete in a costeffective manner and may subject us to material compliance costs and penalties valley primarily through its principal subsidiary and certain nonbank subsidiaries is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole many laws and regulations affect valleys lending practices capital structure investment practices dividend policy and growth among other things they encourage valley to ensure a satisfactory level of lending in defined areas and establish and maintain comprehensive programs relating to antimoney laundering and customer identification congress state legislatures and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws regulations and policies table start form 10k table end for possible changes changes to statutes regulations or regulatory policies including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes regulations or policies could affect valley in substantial and unpredictable ways such changes could subject valley to additional costs limit the types of financial services and products it may offer andor increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products among other things failure to comply with laws regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies civil money penalties andor reputation damage which could have a material adverse effect on valleys business financial condition and results of operations valleys compliance with certain of these laws will be considered by banking regulators when reviewing bank merger and bank holding company acquisitions we are subject to numerous laws designed to protect consumers including the community reinvestment act and fair lending laws and failure to comply with these laws could lead to a wide variety of sanctions the community reinvestment act the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act and other fair lending laws and regulations impose community investment and nondiscriminatory lending requirements on financial institutions the consumer financial protection bureau the department of justice and other federal agencies are responsible for enforcing these laws and regulations a successful regulatory challenge to an institutions performance under the community reinvestment act the equal credit opportunity act the fair housing act or other fair lending laws and regulations could result in a wide variety of sanctions including damages and civil money penalties injunctive relief restrictions on mergers and acquisitions restrictions on expansion and restrictions on entering new business lines private parties also may challenge an institutions performance under fair lending laws in litigation such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations future acquisitions may dilute shareholder value especially tangible book value per share we regularly evaluate opportunities to acquire other financial institutions as a result merger and acquisition discussions and in some cases negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash debt or equity securities may occur at any time acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values and therefore some dilution of our tangible book value per common share may occur in connection with any future acquisitions future offerings of common stock preferred stock debt or other securities may adversely affect the market price of our stock and dilute the holdings of existing shareholders in the future we may increase our capital resources or if our or the banks actual or projected capital ratios fall below or near the current basel iii regulatory required minimums we or the bank could be forced to raise additional capital by making additional offerings of common stock preferred stock or debt securities additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both holders of our common stock are not entitled to preemptive rights or other protections against dilution upon liquidation holders of our debt securities and shares of preferred stock and lenders with respect to other borrowings will receive distributions of our available assets prior to the holders of our common stock in august valley issued million shares of noncumulative perpetual stock with a dividend at issuance of percent and a liquidation preference of per share see note to the consolidated financial statements for more details on our common and preferred stock changes in accounting policies or accounting standards could cause us to change the manner in which we report our financial results and condition in adverse ways and could subject us to additional costs and expenses valleys accounting policies are fundamental to understanding its financial results and condition some of these policies require the use of estimates and assumptions that may affect the value of valleys assets or liabilities and financial results valley identified its accounting policies regarding the allowance for loan losses purchased creditimpaired loans goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical because they require management to make difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain under each of these policies it is possible that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions using different assumptions or as new information becomes available from time to time the fasb and the sec change their guidance governing the form and content of valleys external financial statements in addition accounting standard setters and those who interpret us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap such as the fasb sec banking regulators and valleys independent registered public accounting firm may change or even reverse their previous interpretations or positions on how these standards should be applied such changes are expected to continue and may accelerate dependent upon the fasb and international accounting standards board commitments to achieving convergence between us gaap and international financial reporting standards changes in us gaap and changes in current interpretations are beyond valleys control can be hard to predict and could materially impact how valley reports its financial results and condition in certain cases valley could be required to apply new or revised guidance retroactively or apply existing guidance differently also retroactively which may result in valley restating prior period financial statements for material amounts additionally significant changes to us gaap may require costly technology changes additional training and personnel and other expenses that will negatively impact our results of operations table start form 10k table end we may be unable to adequately manage our liquidity risk which could affect our ability to meet our obligations as they become due capitalize on growth opportunities or pay regular dividends on our common stock liquidity risk is the potential that valley will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise or pay regular dividends on our common stock because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances liquidity is required to fund various obligations including credit commitments to borrowers mortgage and other loan originations withdrawals by depositors repayment of borrowings dividends to shareholders operating expenses and capital expenditures liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and retention principal and interest payments on loans principal and interest payments on investment securities sale maturity and prepayment of investment securities net cash provided from operations and access to other funding sources such as the fhlb and certain brokered deposit channels established by the bank our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general factors that could have a detrimental impact to our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to persistent weakness or downturn in the economy or adverse regulatory action against us our ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not necessarily specific to us such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole our market share and income may be adversely affected by our inability to successfully compete against larger and more diverse financial service providers and digital fintech startup firms valley faces substantial competition in all areas of its operations from a variety of different competitors many of which are larger and may have more financial resources than valley to deal with the potential negative changes in the financial markets and regulatory landscape valley competes with other providers of financial services such as commercial and savings banks savings and loan associations credit unions money market and mutual funds mortgage companies title agencies asset managers insurance companies and a large list of other local regional and national institutions which offer financial services additionally the financial services industry is facing a wave of digital disruption from fintech companies that provide innovative webbased solutions to traditional retail banking services and products fintech companies tend to have stronger operating efficiencies and fewer regulatory burdens than their traditional bank counterparts including valley mergers and acquisitions of financial institutions within new jersey the new york metropolitan area and florida may also occur given the current difficult banking environment and add more competitive pressure to a substantial portion of our marketplace our profitability depends upon our continued ability to successfully compete in our market area if valley is unable to compete effectively it may lose market share and its income generated from loans deposits and other financial products may decline our ability to make opportunistic acquisitions is subject to significant risks including the risk that regulators will not provide the requisite approvals we may make opportunistic whole or partial acquisitions of other banks branches financial institutions or related businesses from time to time that we expect may further our business strategy any possible acquisition will be subject to regulatory approval and there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such approval in a timely manner or at all even if we obtain regulatory approval these acquisitions could involve numerous risks including lower than expected performance or higher than expected costs difficulties related to integration diversion of managements attention from other business activities changes in relationships with customers and the potential loss of key employees in addition we may not be successful in identifying acquisition candidates integrating acquired institutions or preventing deposit erosion or loan quality deterioration at acquired institutions competition for acquisitions can be highly competitive and we may not be able to acquire other institutions on attractive terms there can be no assurance that we will be successful in completing or will even pursue future acquisitions or if such transactions are completed that we will be successful in integrating acquired businesses into operations ability to grow may be limited if we choose not to pursue or are unable to successfully make acquisitions in the future failure to successfully implement our growth strategies could cause us to incur substantial costs and expenses which may not be recouped and adversely affect our future profitability from time to time valley may implement new lines of business or offer new products and services within existing lines of business there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed valley may invest significant time and resources to develop and market new lines of business andor products and services initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business andor new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible external factors such as compliance with regulations competitive alternatives and shifting customer preferences may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of table start form 10k table end business or a new product or service additionally any new line of business andor new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of valleys system of internal controls failure to successfully manage these risks could have a material adverse effect on valleys business results of operations and financial condition we may not keep pace with technological change within the financial services industry negatively affecting our ability to remain competitive and profitable the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technologydriven products and services the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs valleys future success depends in part upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands as well as to create additional efficiencies in valleys operations many of valleys competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements valley may not be able to effectively implement new technologydriven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to its customers failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on valleys business and in turn valleys financial condition and results of operations we rely on our systems employees and certain service providers and if our system fails our operations could be disrupted we face the risk that the design of our controls and procedures including those to mitigate the risk of fraud by employees or outsiders may prove to be inadequate or are circumvented thereby causing delays in detection of errors or inaccuracies in data and information we regularly review and update our internal controls disclosure controls and procedures and corporate governance policies and procedures any system of controls however well designed and operated is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable not absolute assurances that the objectives of the system are met any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we may also be subject to disruptions of our systems arising from events that are wholly or partially beyond our control including for example electrical or telecommunications outages which may give rise to losses in service to customers and to financial loss or liability we are further exposed to the risk that our external vendors may be unable to fulfill their contractual obligations or will be subject to the same risk of fraud or operational errors by their respective employees as us and to the risk that our or our vendors business continuity and data security systems prove to be inadequate we maintain a
