earnings per share of exclusive of a modest charge associated with debt repayment adjusted earnings were million representing the highest level of quarterly earnings in valleys entire history these are extraordinary results against the backdrop of a global health pandemic a near zero interest rate environment and general economic uncertainty weve achieved these results by building a diverse and strong balance sheet and developing a corporate culture focused on customer service and responsiveness on an adjusted basis our preprovision net revenue increased from the second quarter this growth reflected strong fee income and continued interest expense reductions which offset asset yield pressures this quarters adjusted preprovision net revenue as a percentage of average assets was up from in the prior quarter and in the third quarter of ph net interest margin pressure across the banking industry has weighed on profitability our ability to preserve our net interest margin and drive higher profitability is exceptionally unique we have also benefited from a focus on positive operating leverage our adjusted efficiency ratio declined to from in the third quarter of this improvement was achieved through yearoveryear revenue growth which exceeded our adjusted expense growth by over times while our financial performance has improved significantly the backdrop remains challenging and future operating leverage will be dependent on our ability to identify and execute on incremental cost savings and revenue opportunities in addition to strong financial results we are pleased to report a significant reduction in our active loan deferrals as of september we had less than billion of loans on active deferral representing of our total loan portfolio this compares to an active deferral level of in july and in may there has been significant focus on the metro new york city economy in recent quarters we remain confident in our conservative lending philosophy and the strength of our borrower base in a few minutes mike will walk you through our exposure to this market and the strong underwriting metrics that support our conviction our credit metrics beyond deferrals improved during the quarter as well while our million provision was approximately lower than the second quarter our reserve coverage ratio continues to grow our recent earnings momentum has positively demonstrated our ability to generate organic capital despite a significant reserve build and cash dividend we have grown tangible book value by in the last months our tangible common equity ratio has increased to from a year ago we acknowledge that the operating environment remains challenging and the economic outlook is uncertain in we have harvested lowhanging fruit on the funding side of the balance sheet we will explore additional opportunities to reduce funding costs and offset continued asset yield pressure valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 our fee income results and the swap of mortgage banking businesses have been extremely strong this year but may normalize going forward expense controls remain a key focus and we will need to work harder to identify cost reduction opportunities in some cases by leveraging new technologies and solutions on the credit side we continue to believe that our conservative underwriting philosophy positions us to outperform in periods of economic stress in summary we are extremely proud of our recent financial results that said we know that we will need to work harder than ever to maintain this high performance i am confident that our team is up to the task now id like to turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some of the quarters additional financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide you can see that valleys reported net interest margin increased to from in the second quarter of on a sequential basis our cost of interestbearing liabilities improved by basis points to and our interest expense declined by approximately at the same time our earning asset yields declined basis points to on the asset side we have reduced the impact of broader yield pressures with mix shifts towards loans and away from loweryielding cash and securities our ability to generate funding cost reductions in both our deposit and the wholesale portfolios has enabled us to absorb asset yield pressures to this point while the significant amount of our repricing opportunity has been captured slide identifies the amount of retail cds expected to mature in the next months at rates well above current offering rates specifically over the next three quarters we have nearly billion of retail maturing cds at an average cost of towards the end of the quarter we paid off million of wholesale funding that carried a cost and was set to mature in going forward we may utilize a portion of our remaining liquidity to redeem other highcost liabilities as a result of our repricing and liquidity deployment levers we continue to believe that we will outperform peers from a net interest margin perspective going forward the bottom left chart of slide illustrates the significant downward trend in our interestbearing deposit costs since the third quarter of in this time our cd and interestbearing nonmaturity deposits have declined by basis points and basis points respectively we believe there is additional room to reduce interestbearing nonmaturity deposit costs in addition to the cd repricing benefit that we identified on the prior slide from a balance perspective total deposits declined slightly from the prior quarter due to the ongoing utilization of ppp funds excluding the runoff of over million of ppprelated deposits during the quarter sequential deposit growth was approximately noninterest bearing deposit generation remained strong with balances increasing approximately exclusive of ppp in recent quarters we have discussed the ongoing customer rotation from cds into lower cost transaction accounts this trend continued in the quarter with interestbearing transaction balances increasing to more than offset a decline in cd balances earlier this year we bolstered our liquidity position to prepare for the uncertainty of the current environment on june we held nearly billion of cash and equivalents on our balance sheet as our understanding of the pandemic has evolved and the economic impacts come into focus we began to utilize some of this liquidity by september our cash position had declined to approximately billion as mentioned we may utilize some of our remaining liquidity to pay off wholesale liabilities valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 slide details our loan portfolio and the asset yield pressure that we are experiencing along with other banks in the industry during the quarter loan yields declined basis points however on a positive note as you can see in the chart new origination yields were effectively unchanged at at loan origination volume also increased from the second quarter and spreads on new originations expanded basis points our new loan spreads are currently at their widest level since the second quarter of total loans of billion included roughly billion of outstanding ppp loans at the end of the quarter exclusive of ppp our loan portfolio has increased approximately on an annualized basis since the end of we continue to see consistent activity in our core commercial real estate segments this quarter saw a rebound in consumer lending activity which helped to stabilize the balances in those portfolios as well slide provides additional insight into our commercial real estate portfolio which is welldiversified in terms of both collateral and geography over the last few quarters there has been an increased external focus on metro new york and manhattan specifically as you can see only of our cre portfolio is tied to nonmultifamily properties in manhattan the bottom table illustrates key underwriting metrics for the portfolio by geography i would highlight our low weighted average ltv of for the portfolio and for noncoop properties in manhattan we remain confident in our underwriting and believe we are wellpositioned to navigate the current environment from a credit perspective moving to slide our noninterest income increased from the linked quarter driven primarily by strength in loan sale gains and swap revenue fee income ticked up to of total revenue from in the prior quarter we remain focused on growing diverse revenue streams over time and enhancing customer adoption of the various financial products that we offer swap fees were over million during the quarter as we originated backtoback swaps on over million of notional loans our borrowers continue to demand the interest rate protection provided by our swap offerings net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased approximately sequentially reflecting both higher loan sale volumes and gain on sale margin expansion residential loans sold exceeded million for the period up from million in the linked quarter while the gain on sale margin increased over basis points to slide provides an overview of our quarterly operating expenses and the continued improvement in our adjusted efficiency ratio our expenses on both the reported and adjusted basis increased modestly from the prior quarter adjusted expenses exclusive of de minimis merger charges a million charge for debt extinguishment and a million for tax amortization totaled million this was up million or approximately from the prior quarter expenses associated with covid19 declined to million from above million in each of the prior two quarters the ongoing expense is related to enhanced cleaning and sanitation efforts which are likely to persist for the duration of the pandemic our adjusted efficiency ratio continued to improve coming in at versus in the second quarter as ira mentioned on a yearoveryear basis we have generated revenue growth with only an increase in adjusted operating expenses we remain focused on expense control and more specifically positive operating leverage as revenue pressures continue to build across the industry on slide we provide an overview of the evolution of our branch count we recognize that many banks have announced reactive branch closures to combat revenue headwinds at valley we consistently evaluate our branch network to ensure that we are best positioned to efficiently meet our clients needs this proactive approach has resulted in a significant improvement in our average branch size and efficiency since we anticipate closing an additional branches over the next few months and well continue to evaluate additional opportunities to streamline our delivery channels valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 turning to slide and asset quality our allowance for credit losses increased approximately million to of loans from in the second quarter our allowance represents of nonppp loans and has more than doubled from the end of the quarters reserve build reflects a million provision and nearly million of net chargeoffs in line with the prior quarter chargeoffs in the quarter included approximately million for the taxi medallion portfolio as valuations continued to decline there was an additional million chargeoff for a ci loan that has experienced trouble prior to the onset of covid19 this loan was fully reserved as of june on the bottom left you can see the buildup of our allowance as compared to the prior quarter the net increase in the allowance is primarily the result of managements qualitative assessment of ongoing risks associated with covid while the moodys economic forecast to support our cecl model have improved since the summer it became clear at the end of the third quarter that the moodys baseline scenario did not fully account for the increased likelihood that a federal stimulus bill would not be passed in the nearterm in response we conservatively shifted our model weightings away from the baseline and more towards moodys adverse and prolonged recession scenarios this shift resulted in a more adverse economic outlook and higher provision our model now reflects modest gdp declines to the first half of despite the reweighting our unemployment projections are slightly more optimistic than in the second quarter as a result of an improved outlook in each of the moodys scenarios that we utilize we continue to believe that future provisioning activity will be largely dependent on the degree that economic outcomes track our expectations nonaccrual loans declined nearly million or in the quarter driven primarily by a reduction in the ci segment as a percentage of total loans nonaccruals declined to from in the second quarter we also saw a significant improvement in our accruing past due loans which represented of loans in the third quarter as compared to in the second quarter slide illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the ongoing improvement in our capital ratios tangible book value has increased in the last months driven by our increased earnings power our tangible common equity ratio increased to from in the second quarter this reflects our strong earnings and the utilization of some excess liquidity during the quarter we estimate that a billion of ppp loans reduced our tce to total asset ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter on a yearoveryear basis we have also seen a significant improvement in our regulatory capital ratios we remain confident in our capital levels and believe that the consistent growth in our riskbased ratios illustrate our improving ability to increase our capital levels on an organic basis with that ill turn the call back over to ira for some closing comments ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks mike im extremely proud of valleys results for the quarter and on a yeartodate basis our flexible and diverse balance sheet has enabled us to preserve our net interest margin in the face of a challenging interest rate environment our positive operating leverage and the dramatic improvement in our efficiency ratio is a testament to the innovative and responsive culture embodied by our team we remain confident in our credit underwriting and the strength of our loan portfolio we look forward to continued success for the remainder of the year and into with that i would now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from frank schiraldi of piper sandler your line is now open frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies well it seems like youre certainly ahead of peers in terms of cost initiatives i mean you guys talked a little bit about branch consolidation and mike you mentioned and ira you mentioned as well positive operating leverage just wondering your thoughts going forward how confident you are in being able to deliver a positive operating leverage given the tough revenue environment and if you think you can keep for example efficiency ratio below in the future here ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks thanks for the question frank i think at valley its definitely become the culture as to how we think about expenses throughout the entire organization and its a way forward for us as to how we think about innovating and the use of technology weve been very proactive as to how we think about that overall expense base here we didnt need covid to tell us that the expense model needed to change that it was really changes based on customer behavior as well as the opportunities presented from technology so we think were definitely ahead of where our peers are and have a good path forward as to how were looking at the expense base mike is there something you want to add michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah the only thing i would say is dont lose sight of the fact on the opportunities that we still have to reprice our term funding costs as well thats shown on page of our investor presentation under our 12month forward maturity schedule and relative to the industry we believe that this advantage for us and the results in managing our operating leverage to has demonstrated that weve taken full advantage of that as weve tried to defend the nim in this challenging environment frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies and then just one followup if i could on capital just wondering if you guys mentioned given liquidity on the balance sheet you do have the potential for additional payoff on the wholesale side id imagine its not valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 necessarily significant to capital levels anything you might do further there but just wondering how your thoughts on capital levels have maybe evolved and where you think at this point what is the right sort of tce ratio for valley to operate at in the future ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp yeah i think you know we had previously given guidance i think around ph was an appropriate tce to a ta number for us i think as we think about capital its really about the optionality and the flexibility that we have moving forward i think theres a lot of strategic initiatives within the organization that we have and having the appropriate capital levels to support those initiatives is really where the focus is at this point so as opposed to being pinned down and telling you its or whatever that specific number may be i think as we think about capital its really that optionality there is so many opportunities in this organization today and having the appropriate capital levels for that is really where were focused frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies got it michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp just to add that the focus on growing organic capital is very strong its just as cultural in our company as our desire for operating leverage as well and improvements in expenses as an evidence of that when you look at our tce levels and you take into account what ppp has done to that which we estimate at basis points combined with where were at on cet1 today both of those are the highest in the last quarters so weve clearly turned the corner and made some significant progress frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies sure okay but it doesnt sound like a real change to guide ira in terms of you mentioned in the past i mean theres no change to thinking that that number has changed significantly ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp i dont think giving a guide right now is appropriate for us i think maybe well consider as we move forward but i think just highlighting mikes point on an absolute basis look where we are today versus where we were four five six seven years ago its an unbelievable basis to where we are and you layer on top of that the fact that we have a ppnr of today on an adjusted basis the amount of organic capital that were originating today is tremendous so once again i think it just goes back to the tremendous amount of opportunities we have within the organization supported by the organic growth that were doing which is something valley hasnt historically had frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay all right great thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks frank operator thank you in the interest of time we ask that you ask one question and one followup any additional questions please reenter the queue our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is alex lau on for steve ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp hi alex alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc my first question is on loan growth you had loan growth in commercial real estate this quarter and you mentioned in the release controlled growth can you explain what do you mean by this and what do you look at to qualify for this and also how is the pipeline looking into the fourth quarter for commercial real estate thank you thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp thanks alex this is tom iadanza by controlled growth what we mean is that we do a lot of business with existing customers people have been through various economic cycles historically its been existing customers new and its probably increased to since the pandemic increased our focus is on relationshipdriven business very diversified were very granular our average real estate loan is still under million our average ci loan is still under million were diverse by markets were not heavy in manhattan were heavier in the suburbs and well continue to focus on that relationshipdriven business our conservative underwriting standards will be maintained through all of this we will not stretch to grow our pipelines pre pandemic probably were in the billion range ph likely theyre down from that level now we believe well grow modestly but stay at that billion billion level going forward alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and then a question on nim outside of your time deposits you have savings deposits at basis points and then in the last zero interest rate environment you were in the low do you think you can go below this basis point range this time around michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp you know i wont give guidance on a specific number but i would say this that the processes that we have set up to benchmark ourselves against the market and then react quickly are probably the strongest theyve ever been in the companys history so i feel fairly confident that if the market will allow for that were poised and can quickly valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 react and were constantly doing this to make sure that were still competitive and that were not overpaying on that source of funding alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from collyn gilbert of kbw your line is now open collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc mike just along the lines of margin youve given some great disclosures there and obviously youve made a significant headway on the funding side but i think and you pointed this out one of the interesting points was that the loan origination yields seem to be flat from can you just talk a little bit about that or maybe tom if you weigh in on that as well sort of do you think this loan yields have kind of bottomed and spreads are widening a bit i know you referenced that your new spreads are up over a year ago but just kind of some color around kind of loan pricing and if youve perhaps seen a bottom in where loan yields are thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp its hard to predict if weve seen a bottom but we have implemented floors in all of our loans and that has helped on those spreads well continue to do that its also responsiveness ph that our customers at they use us all the time they come to us because we can get it done and they recognize the value in todays market of paying for that performance so well continue to have floors well continue to aggressively bring in deposits to fund this and the good news is the spreads are going up and the quality of the loans and the level of leverage is going down so were kind of seeing it on both the quality and return front we think it will continue but its hard to predict its still competitive for high quality loans still have a lot of competition today collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great i will stick to my one question and then get back in the queue for the rest thanks guys operator thank you and our next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets your line is now open valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just on your hotel and hospitality deferrals it kind of ticked up a little bit is that primarily around the new york area and just do you have any latest occupancy statistics on that versus the year ago ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp yeah to put it in context the hotel portfolio in total is about million and million is on deferral the uptick is coming mostly out of florida which we have primary portfolio of hotels in we dont really have much new york new jersey so were not seeing the same experience there i do want to point out that going into the pandemic the loantovalues on these portfolios were less than its all real estate secured we have ph pgs on all the increase in this particular quarter was to a specific borrower who is highly liquid has the wherewithal to sustain this and also has revenue and resources that are not tied to the hotel business and the same experience on restaurant though thats a little bit more spread out new york new jersey and florida but weve seen a significant decline and those deferrals were down to about million in total and loan tovalue going into the pandemic was on that portfolio its all real estate secured and we have ph pgs we dont expect it to get any worse steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate the color on that and then just going back on the margin maybe mike you can handle this one your shortterm and longterm borrowings tipped a little higher this quarter what was whats the driver behind that was it just lower cost borrowings rolling off and then should we expect this to go a little higher in the fourth quarter with the billion rolling off michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp sure so the shortterm borrowings are exactly as you said thats the maturities there the longterm side is the impact of having the sub debt issuance for an entire quarter so i think thats probably fairly selfexplanatory what i would say on the remaining funding side the nondebtrelated funding side if you go to page ph and the ip and you look at those rates especially in the first second and third quarter of as of this morning fhlb advance rates as a proxy range between basis points and basis points so you can see theres still a lot of leverage for us to reprice valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 and on the maturing cd book which is fhlb is not a good proxy we know with offering rates today theres two things going on there one people are seeking greater liquidity so as their cds mature they will transition into a transaction account so we have seen that its increased our deposits overall and second the availability for longerterm cd rates even if you put them out there customers are not going to take that given the absolute levels of rates and so when they do resign up for a new cd its at a much lower rate and our retention there has been very strong as well steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate thank you mike michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew breese of stephens ph incorporated your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey i was hoping could you quantify total ppp income for the quarter and then mike i know you characterize the margin outlook in terms of you think you will outperform peers but i guess i perhaps thats open to interpretation could you maybe characterize the margin outlook in terms of whether you think it can remain stable or expand from here thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey matt ill this is tom ill handle the income for the quarter and then mike will talk about the margin again the third quarter income from ppp was about million million of that is from interest million is from fees michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and i think if i understand your question on nim it was related to my prepared remarks around the relative advantage that we have to peers so i think its like motherhood and apple pie to say that theres nim compression in the market i mean thats absolutely going on the things that are encouraging to us that weve already visited about are the fact that our new loan originations have seemingly flattened out with second quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 yet to be determined whether that continues but as tom mentioned having fours on our loans and having greater discipline in this environment seems to be an advantage and then i would just couple that again with the funding side as i mentioned earlier we still have opportunities here and you can see both the dollars and the rates on the ph ip on page okay and then i would lastly say in especially on new originations the spread on new originations on the lending side are at basis points higher so weve seen a better loan and a better spread in this market matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood and then in terms of expenses you have branches being cut in the fourth quarter i was hoping for maybe if you could quantify what the expenses tied to that are and then just thinking about the longerterm expense outlook do you feel like this kind of million range is appropriate for this environment michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so on the branches that we announced that we would close and weve achieved regulatory approval correct regulatory approval matthew breese q analyst stephens inc yes correct michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp we estimate the fullyear cost savings to be between million and million operator thank you operator instructions and we do have a followup question from collyn gilbert of kbw your line is now open collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks okay just a followup on the expense question and getting a little bit more granular on it just curious how specifically the professional fee line is going to trend and will that kind of stay elevated as you guys are looking at some of these technology investments and technology initiatives or does that come down and then i just also to on that line just curious about your outlook for mortgage banking michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah ill take maybe a little different tack on it i will address the specific question on professional fees but let me kind of give you a little more color it is somewhat in the earnings release as well related to expenses so the adjusted expenses in the third quarter were million and as we said earlier thats a increase against but theres a couple of things in there that you need to consider first theres million increase in compensation and benefitrelated expenses but we think that thats mostly due to medical and employer 401k expenses because were a selffunded plan and i think at this juncture in the valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 pandemic were starting to see some of our employee base and our covered individuals under our plan get medical treatment for things that were delayed early in the pandemic and theyre going back to their doctor so i think thats first and foremost there was also a decline in our compensationrelated deferred loan costs due to just absolute lower loan volumes thats just how it works and then there was a modest incentive accrual as well increase as it relates to professional fees as weve talked about our core system improvements around here and all the things were doing in technology it stands to reason over time those costs will increase and we do have a lot of consultingrelated expense right now thats not capitalized just because of where were at in the life cycle of those projects so they get more of that expense gets expensed upfront and then once you get past that youll see more of that going into being capitalized collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp collyn just to followup on mikes point i think the real focus here is on the operating leverage and i think maintaining an expense base that supports the growth of the organization and where we are is really important today but the focus is on making sure that were generating positive operating leverage and i think the times that we did this period reflects where we think were going to be able to continue that path as really as we ph guide forward on the mortgage banking i think obviously its a function of where interest rates are today i think tom alluded to earlier that pipelines remain really strong and we think theres going to be significant growth there but it really reflects the diverse business model that weve created here and its something that we think as long as interest rates remain favorable that well be able to benefit from collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay great ill leave it there thanks guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks collyn operator thank you and ladies and gentlemen this does conclude our questionandanswer session i would now like to turn the call back over to ira robbins for any closing remarks ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp once again we thank you for joining us today and look forward to continue
