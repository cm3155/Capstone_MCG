results to differ from those statements with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis in the fourth quarter of valley reported net income of million and earnings per share of exclusive of noncore items including the onetime special fdic assessment tied to the ph years bank failures adjusted net income and eps were million and respectively while im pleased with the quarters balance sheet trends im disappointed with the earnings and profitability metrics which i will discuss shortly on the positive side we made progress enhancing ci growth while curtailing commercial real estate or originations this enabled us to both accrete organic capital and reduce funding needs on the deposit side we added a remarkable net new consumer households and net new commercial deposit relationships during the year this represents growth in consumer households and growth in commercial relationships from the same period a year ago the ongoing addition of new deposit clients is critical as it directly relates to valleys franchise value and our future earnings potential our new customer growth was broad based across all of our geographies and i might add was undertaken against the backdrop of a difficult external environment when midsized banks like valley were too often front page news during the quarter our new relationships helped to generate strong customer deposit inflows which enabled us to significantly reduce our reliance on broker deposits while customer deposit inflows were exceptional the organizationlike focus on ensuring a successful core conversion in october likely led us to take our eyes off the ball relative to deposit pricing there is no doubt that this negatively impacted net interest income during the quarter and in a few minutes mike will illustrate some of the subsequent efforts that we have undertaken to manage these deposit costs going forward from a strategic perspective we are refocusing on holistic customer profitability and will return to pricing deposits in consideration of balance and return as opposed to just balance the quarter was also impacted by a few additional factors worth calling out first ph waived service charges and proactive efforts taken to supplement customer support both associated with our core conversion weighed on quarterly earnings by an estimated amount equaling approximately per share these efforts were enacted out of an abundance of caution to ensure that our customer experience smoothly transitioned to our new system im pleased with the customer response to our core conversion but acknowledge that some of the amounts of the excess support costs will persist in the first quarter as well secondly our provision was partially elevated as a result of a loan chargeoff in our commercial premium finance business the after tax impact of the associated provision was approximately per share as well this business line has approximately million in outstanding balances and we have an agreement in place to sell this business and the portion of the outstanding loans at what is expected to be a modest premium during the first quarter of while this quarters earnings are not satisfactory i continue to believe that our strategic progress over the last few years positioned us well in the evolving banking landscape the financial consistency that we have achieved in support of this strategic evolution is evident in our tangible book value growth results our stated tangible book value has increased since which is more than double our proxy peers at our value creation as measured by tangible book value plus the dividends we have paid out totaled valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 since or more than times our proxy peer median of from a balance sheet perspective we have successfully transformed and diversified our funding base at the end of approximately of our deposits were held in our branch network by utilizing technology to expand our delivery channels and establishing new growthoriented deposit verticals we have reduced our reliance on branch deposits to just today from a geographic perspective of our total deposits were in the northeast branches in today that number is down to just of total deposits our focus on geographic diversity and holistic relationship banking has benefited the asset side of our business as well in of our total loan portfolio was in new jersey and new york that composition has declined to just today in we entered florida with the acquisition of first united bank which had just over billion in loans through additional strategic acquisitions and targeted organic efforts in this dynamic growthoriented market our florida loan portfolio has expanded beyond billion there continue to be significant and diverse commercial growth opportunities available to us in florida and across our entire footprint the proactive evolution of our technology infrastructure is less tangible but equally significant achievement for our organization we have recruited and developed a strong pool of technology talent which has helped us to modernize our infrastructure and positions us to be on the leading edge of further advancements in the banking space our technology adoption has allowed us to scale the franchise with limited net head count growth since we have nearly doubled our asset base from billion to billion with a near increase in head count our recent core conversion align technology across our company and provides additional capabilities which we look forward to leveraging for our clients as we move past the conversion we anticipate that further efficiencies will also emerge we have also focused on enhancing a more uniform data infrastructure which allows us to react quickly and purposefully to changing market dynamics ph an internal ai working group has been established to help us determine appropriate potential use cases and to begin to execute on related opportunities i now want to pivot to our strategic imperatives for the coming year while none of these are new initiatives for valley we continue to believe that they will drive shareholder value over the long time first we need to continue to drive core deposits to the bank we have an incredible serviceoriented branch network across our dynamic geographic footprint which generate more consumer and commercial activity out of these locations in as the curve increasingly normalizes we will further leverage the existing specialty niches that we have established and will build on our momentum for the second half of secondly we will continue to deemphasize investor commercial real estate lending in favor of ci and owner occupied cre we have restructured our commercial banking organization to better align expertise and experience with opportunities in our markets and business lines our enhanced treasury management capabilities and product offerings will support expanded wallet share among our customer base and help us to acquire new customers on the commercial side we have also adjusted our incentive programs in support of our deposit gathering and lending goals which will drive further strategic alignment across the entire organization finally we will continue to grow our differentiated noninterest income businesses to diversify our revenue base through organic and acquisitive efforts we have developed a robust suite of fee income products and service offerings for our growing customer base the recent enhancements of our treasury management offering will help to offset certain capital market headwinds associated with lower swaprelated revenues in the industry challenges of the past year confirmed to me that we have undertaken the right longterm strategy and im pleased with our ability to navigate this difficult year will be about accelerating our progress towards achieving our strategic initiatives and improving our performance as we continue to mature as we execute on these initiatives i want to reiterate that we continue to prioritize tangible book value growth we believe that valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 consistent growth in tangible book value will drive shareholder value over time and we continue to expect to outperform our peers on this metric with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira on slide you can see the quarters deposit trends direct customer deposits increased approximately billion to largely offset the significant billion reduction in indirect deposits the meaningful reduction in our reliance on wholesale deposits was a key highlight of the quarter we generated strong growth in our interestbearing transaction accounts and were pleased by the slowdown in noninterest deposit runoff that said we acknowledge that a competitive interest rate is one of the tools used to support our generation efforts during the quarter still the pace of deposit cost increase has slowed and in a moment michael outlined efforts which we have undertaken to control interest expense on a goforward basis the next slide provides more detail on the composition of our deposit portfolio by delivery channel and business line traditional branch deposits increased approximately million during the quarter this growth was spread across our geographic footprint our specialty niches increased approximately billion as well with key contributions from our online delivery channel and technology deposit team turning to the next slide you can see the continued diversity and granularity of our deposit base no single commercial industry accounts for more than of our deposits our government portfolio remains diversified across our footprint and is fully collateralized relative to state collateral requirements slide provides an overview of our loan growth and portfolio composition at the top left you can see the proactive growth slowdown which occurred throughout ultimately we achieved the low end of the to growth target that we had laid out at the start of the year annualized loan growth slowed consistently as the year progressed illustrating our ability to be responsive to changing market dynamics the following slide breaks down our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography as a reminder we have an extremely granular loan portfolio which is welldiversified by collateral type and geography our debt service coverage and loan to value metrics remain very attractive we continue to closely monitor pools of maturing and resetting loans and believe that our borrowers are wellpositioned to absorb the passthrough of higher rates this reflects consistent underwriting discipline at conservative cap rates and significant stress testing efforts at origination the next two slides provide additional details around our multifamily and office portfolios from a multifamily perspective our billion portfolio includes billion of coop loans with an extremely low loan to value exclusive of our coop portfolio our manhattan multifamily exposure is a mere million which you can see in the last column of the table the remainder of the portfolio is welldiversified across our footprint with low average loan sizes and attractive loan to value and debt service coverage ratio metrics with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight into the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 thank you tom slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends while end of period noninterestbearing deposits stabilized the decline in noninterest deposits on an average basis weighed on quarterly net interest income by approximately million throughout the quarter we replaced maturing direct and indirect cds with relatively high yielding interestbearing transaction accounts and promotional retail cds which was the cost of our significant customer deposit growth during the quarter the right side of this page outlines efforts that have been undertaken to more precisely manage our funding costs on a goforward basis we have cut back the high yield savings rate in our online channel but remained competitive we have also significantly reduced our oneyear cd rate which will help to mitigate the repricing issue that we faced during the recent quarter finally we are working with our relationship bankers to ensure that deposit rates are reasonable in the context of holistic customer profitability in the few quarters following the industrys challenges in march we priced deposit products to ensure that ph direct customer balances rebounded as we continue to move past these challenges we will price products with a more even consideration of balances and profitability turning to the next slide you can see that noninterest income on an adjusted basis was generally stable from the third quarter of deposit service charges declined sequentially as we waived certain transactional fees around the time of our core conversion other than this growth trends were relatively strong for the quarter despite the headwind of swap revenues on the following slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter adjusting for our million fdic special assessment and ph certain other nonrecurring litigation and merger charges noninterest expenses were approximately million on an adjusted basis compensation costs continue to be very wellcontrolled the sequential expense increase was primarily due to higher traditional fdic assessment costs consulting costs occupancy and advertising expenses and the seasonal uptick in other business development expenses a portion of the quarters expense increase was associated with certain consulting and customer support initiatives associated with our core system conversion in october while the customer experience associated with our conversion has been extremely positive some of these costs will have a tail into the first quarter as you know the first quarter also has traditional seasonal headwinds associated with payroll taxes we are very pleased with our ability to proactively control head count and associated compensation expenses throughout we expect that will be a more normal year in terms of expense trajectory and as you will see shortly we anticipate midsingledigit expense growth in the coming year slide illustrates our asset quality trends for the last five quarters while nonaccrual loans ticked up somewhat during the quarter they remain relatively flat on a yearoveryear basis net chargeoffs were million during the quarter and included approximately million associated with our commercial premium finance business which is under an agreement to sell during the first quarter of the year as a result of our higher provision our allowance for credit losses for loans increased basis point during the quarter to of total loans the next slide illustrates the sequential increase in our tangible book value and capital ratios tangible book value increased nearly from the third quarter of and benefited from a reduction in the oci impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio we are pleased that during the year we were able to support our strong loan growth and organically accrete regulatory capital based on our expected loan growth in we would anticipate this trend to continue valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 we lay out our expectations for the coming year on slide we anticipate generating midsingledigit loan growth with a focus on ci and noninvestor commercial real estate in based on consensus interest rate expectations for we would anticipate net interest income growth between and noninterest income should grow between and on an annual basis as headwinds in our swap business are more than offset by continued scale in our wealth insurance and tax advisory businesses as well as our recently enhanced treasury management capabilities noninterest expenses should grow approximately in line with revenue higher fdic costs and inflationary pressures are offset by savings from our core conversion and the continued benefits of our previously announced expense initiatives factoring this guidance together we expect eps to come in just slightly lower than the existing consensus estimate of with that ill turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of frank schiraldi of piper sandler your line is open frank your line is open frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co broker sorry just on the nii guide i recognize you guys follow the market on the forward curve here and most of those rate assumed rate cuts are backloaded in the year what sort of annualized basis or annualized pickup do you get in terms of either nii or nim from a given basis point ph cut whats the assumption michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so i want to make sure i understand the question you want to know what just the ph nim impact would be of a single basis point increase okay im sorry frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co broker yeah basically as you get if we get three or four cuts i mean im just trying to assume or get a sense of what basis points does for on average for the nim or nii in your modeling michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so im going to direct you back to our guidance around to so what were expecting right now in is roughly basis points that will affect most of the short end of the curve as you get less inversion in the curve and that first increase does start in the end march you dont get much in the first quarter but you are correct they are more backloaded on the cuts into the fourth quarter of so im not prepared to answer your question on what is exactly a basis point cut because its going to depend upon the mix of the funding sources at that time for the full year were expecting to increase in nii and that should drive a slightly higher nim yearoveryear ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 and frank conceptually were relatively neutrally positioned to the short end of the curve so theres not a significant move based on if those cuts dont materialize were much more exposed to the longer end as it impacts the benefit that well get as our fixed rate loans mature and reprice frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co broker okay so i guess over the full curve youre still liability sensitive but more neutral to the front end ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yes thats correct frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co broker okay okay and just kind of a i dont know more theoretical question in terms of the business mix has changed a bit here over the years with specialized deposit opportunity the opportunity on the ci side which you guys continue to see in in a more normally sloped yield curve what do you think sort of a normal sort of margin is a normalized sort of nim is for valley in the way youve built the balance sheet here ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah this is ira i think its a lot higher i mean obviously being in an inverted curve for three years running the balance sheet in which we do where we try to take as much of a neutral stance as we can its a real challenging environment for us that said as the curve does get to a more normalized focus we do anticipate significant margin expansion as we get back to in an appropriate environment weve done a really good job shifting the commercial growth within the organization weve been running a cagr on ci growth for an extended period of time and as you mentioned the diversification of the funding base really will help us as that curve gets a little bit more normal and we can get back to an appropriate deposit pricing approach across the organization frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co broker okay great and then if i could just sneak in one last one on that kind of front in terms of specialized deposits coming on board in the quarter the growth there and just thinking through the betas on your deposit book the specialized versus the deposits in the branch does are the betas expanding here given the national businesses and would that help you obviously help you maybe to ph a greater degree in a down rate environment ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i mean those definitely have a bit of a higher beta in some of those national businesses and i think that refers back to what travis said that its going to be a bit more neutral when we have some of that curve impacted right off the bat i think the mix shift from out of noninterestbearing really impacted us during the course of the year so thats changed a little bit of the asset liability right so we do have more sensitivity on the downside on the deposit costs ph than when we were running to noninterestbearing deposits as those are now sitting in interestbearing deposits so that is going to be a benefit to us valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 but i think as you really mentioned its the diversity and the granularity that sits within that deposit book that were really excited about and what the opportunity is as we mentioned earlier on the call i think deposit pricing definitely got a little bit away from us as we were focused more on the core conversion that said i do believe its an easy fix and well we will focus on it and make sure that gets back to results that you would expect from us frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co broker okay great i appreciate the color thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of steve moss of raymond james your line is open steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning im just following up here on the asset liability side of the business just curious with regard to how much of your fixed rate loans and securities reprice in ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah steve so the weve talked in the past we have billion of fixed rate loans its not necessarily linear so we have more of our fixed rate loans repriced in the second half of the year than they do in the first half but in total its between billion and billion that would reprice this year but again thats relatively backloaded steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then on the security side im assuming theres probably just minimal cash flows for the upcoming year ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah duration of securities portfolio is extended to seven years give or take we get yeah its really de minimis its a billion portfolio to couple hundred million dollars in a year steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then on credit here just curious to get a little more color on the uptick in ci and cre indiscernible it sounds like some of it is from the premium finance that you charged off this quarter but just kind of curious as to what the loan types are and any incremental color you can give valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah hey steve its tom there was an uptick in that nonaccrual primarily in the cre business million million of it has since been repaid when you look at our performing past dues you will see a decline on the commercial side and very little if any in that 90day bucket the increase in the accruing past dues is on that residential side and the color on that its our jumbo on balance sheet portfolio average loantovalue of we dont expect any loss historically looking over a 15year period our real estate portfolio ran about charge offs against our peer banks we expect that trend to continue we are seeing really improvement across the board our metrics remain solid especially on the commercial side steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and just curious i noticed in the text that you guys did refer to an uptick in classified assets just kind of curious where did criticized and classified assets end the quarter here thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp ph for the uptick travis youll have the number but the uptick we do the forward review of all of our loans our total portfolio especially looking early on in the year at the ones that are repricing or resetting there was a migration of those loans in the third quarter primarily into that special mention category where they might have fallen below or right at a ph times debt service coverage i just want to remind everyone the loans that we repriced during and our review of reprice resulted in no modifications of any of the contractual terms to the repayment but travis if there is a different number that im not referring to travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah i dont have that number in front of me but i would say in the third quarter that stress test process that tom referenced resulted in a more significant increase in criticized and classified loans again not an impression that we would see additional losses but just the way the debt service coverages shake out in the fourth quarter it was a much more normal increase so it was not as significant michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and this is mike that increase would have been ph obviously in special mention credits not the more extreme ratings steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay got it and maybe just following up to that point as youre seeing some borrowers get close on debt service coverage ratios just curious to what color you can give around the work whether its a workout process borrowers help borrowers ability to maybe pay down a loan just kind of what youre seeing and what potential npa formations you could see here in thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 and again we havent had to modify any terms to those borrowers where we were repricing in the past year year and a half typically our underwriting standards would start we use a higher cap level than probably our peers use we underwrite to current cash flow we dont underwrite to future cash flow our leverage tends to be lower going in our average loantovalue on that real estate portfolio is about ph pretty across all of our asset classes so there is flexibility we do a lot of business with existing comfort customers they have the wherewithal if its tight well either get additional collateral a pay down or reserve to support any funding below at an appropriate level steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah and the other piece i want to add the refinance activity especially in multifamily ticked up in the fourth quarter so it did allow us to exit those nonrelationship noncore loans steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thank you very much for all the color ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of michael perito of kbw your line is open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i understand this isnt necessarily something you guys guide to but im trying to understand some of the cadence of kind of profitability around nim and some of the expense targets and the rationalization i think which will start to have a bigger benefit in the middle part of the year just are you guys willing or able to just kind of qualitatively talk about how youre thinking in the current budget about what the kind of return roe profile will look like as you exit i mean it feels like the first half of the year might continue to be a little bit depressed but just wondering if you can kind of give any indications around that cadence relative to the guide that you provided valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah i think your perspective mike is pretty accurate so i think in the first quarter of the year i mean whether its on the expense side the headwind of payroll tax or on the nii side ph day count and other things and the lack of can change thats projected in the industry environment we anticipate generally stable margin id say in the first quarter improving somewhat in the second quarter and then getting more expansion in third and fourth quarter thats kind of the way the budget is built now based on the implied forward curve in terms of expenses i mean we have if you look back to last year it was a million pickup in the first quarter related to payroll taxes so youre looking at something similar there as we stand here in december weve on an annualized basis got million of expenses out related to the head count reduction that was enacted in june we think there is another million or so give or take on an from an annualized perspective from further actions here in the first quarter on the personnel side and then as we get into the second quarter and beyond there should be some saves related to the core conversion some of these elevated costs that weve talked about with customer support efforts and other things so i think the first quarter there will be some seasonal expense headwinds but then youre looking at general stability over the three quarters following so but we do think the profitability improves throughout the year when you blend it all together again in the midpoint of our range you get to to that puts you at an roa level of that id say similar to what weve achieved this year but it does improve as the year goes on michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i mean it should kind of put you maybe in the on the roa on the exit i guess the question is if revenue to expense grow dollar for dollar right thats not going to really improve much and i thats kind of what the outlook is for but i guess what kind of gives you confidence that in and beyond you guys can get back into a more positive operating leverage territory and continue to see those improvements kind of carry forward in i mean is it just margin is there other kind of unit economics in some of the specialty businesses that youre growing that will benefit from scale would love some additional color there ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think there is a lot of opportunity for us i think if you look at the net interest income side right sitting in an inverted curve hopefully isnt one that we sit in for that much longer but it definitely has an impact on us i think the core conversion is really understated as we think about what the ability to scale looks like for us we changed every single one of our clients into a new core platform across the entire organization that said we put in different apis sitting on top of that core conversion to think about what that client experience looks like you go into valley you open up a checking account in one of our branches its the exact same platform that you do when youre opening up a digital account setting at valley so were very smart i think in the approach that we took as to how we were going to leverage the infrastructure and technology base so from a scalability perspective for us were not paying per individual unit when we open up an individual account to a core provider somewhere we really have a technology infrastructure thats scalable here thats focused on what that client experience is going to look like and will definitely drive outsized growth and when i talked about some of the commercial growth numbers and the consumer growth numbers those are household growth numbers not in not even ph individual accounts that was done during our core valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 conversion when everyone hated midsized banks so i think theres a lot of positive tailwind that we have when we think about what were doing from a franchise value perspective so im really excited about what i think the opportunity is on the expense side of the book but the revenue side is definitely going to begin to accelerate as well michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful and then just lastly kind of on the same line of questioning just the you guys had the to loan growth target for obviously still trying to indiscernible thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp look at our fourth quarter originations they were billion technical difficulty operator one moment please michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry can you guys still hear me i lost operator yes one moment please technical difficulty ladies and gentlemen please stand by for one moment technical difficulty ladies and gentlemen please stand by technical difficulty ladies and gentlemen thank you for standing by technical difficulty ladies and gentlemen thank you for your patience the speakers should be rejoining momentarily technical difficulty travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp valerie can you hear us operator yes sir loud and clear travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp okay sorry about that operator thank you we still have mr perito on connected also ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey sorry mike valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp so we were hearing your question on loan growth but it dropped out when you said ph we guide michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah no no problem and i was it was more just asking its kind of same line of questioning just the loan growth as you guys focus more kind of on pricing of customers and holistic kind of customer profitability et cetera is there is it fair to assume that the incremental loan growth and the customer loans that youre bringing on you guys would think with some of the deposit pricing changes et cetera will be coming on at better kind of profit margins than they were in or is there like a lag to some of those impacts or how should we think about that dynamic thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp we would you should expect that our spreads on those will continue to widen and increase and id give you a little context around it we have seen an uptick in that ci pipeline and that business its probably of what its high point was and it represents of our total portfolio and its across the ph old business lines especially in our healthcare and fund banking lines so we are starting to see the improvement and spreads are holding ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp mike really just adding to that when you think about the compression weve seen in the margin is largely a function as weve talked about some of the mix shift and some of the other repricing as rates either stabilize which they seem to have or go down there really is going be a significant benefit to us the ph new value margin that we put on is from to which reflects the ability that we have from a pricing perspective and how were going about it from a profitability perspective the new loans that we put on weve been able to bring on equal amount of funding associated with that from a client perspective so ph its not as even if were out of the brokered market so once we do get some stabilization which we anticipate having on that mix shift there really is upside for what that margin looks like based on the fact that new the new originations as tom mentioned billion came on at a spread of positive for us michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful and then just i wanted to clarify something quick and ill step back which is mike can you repeat i just want to make sure i heard it correctly just the rate assumptions in baked into the nii guide around fed funds and then just to be clear travis youre basically saying there like on the short end whether its two cuts three cuts four cuts it doesnt actually have a huge impact to its more of the long end and then some of the back book and other dynamics that weve been discussing just want to make sure i heard that all right valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thats correct and while we havent laid out specifically and we expect the fed to cut this amount on this date i can tell you the first rate cut that we anticipate is basis points but they accelerate as the year goes on so we get larger rate cuts in the third and fourth quarters and again the biggest benefit to us would be a lessening of the inversion in the curve and a reduction in shortterm interest rates hence why we took the cost this quarter to shorten our duration on our liabilities or just funding generally as tom talked about around the mix of our deposits moving away from fhlb and some of our maturing where they were indirect or direct cds that we had in the fourth quarter to money market and transaction accounts and that was all done purposefully to prepare the balance sheet for the fed cut michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you guys i appreciate the taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp ph good morning jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just followup on that mike is that the liability shortening is that largely complete for you guys at this point michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp its largely complete there is another big piece in the first quarter still to come it was loaded frontend loaded because we were preparing for this when we were putting on these liabilities with duration going back to the first quarter of last year so theres another piece in the first quarter and then after that it tails off quite a bit jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then on the same topic slide you talked about the cd rate reductions in december and then you have some more coming in youre saying maturing liabilities in the first quarter what was the reaction valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 on the cd repricing and is this maturing liability piece is that deposits as well or what is that and where can that reprice michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so the customer impact on it is yet to be seen but i dont expect it to be extreme so to be really clear about that one year cd rate the majority of the impact of that will be cds that will roll so if you remember from our previous comments back in we put on several cd specials most notably around a 13month duration and now those things are rolling at months and so were reducing the rolling jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp indiscernible average between70 to retention of the cds when were in market so i think there should be a pretty big tailwind there jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good good and then ira its kind of a margin question but maybe not but it feels like maybe the deposit pricing pressure was a little bit more than you expected but to me i look at it and i think about the numbers and maybe you were at the bottom of the margin so curious on that and then also curious about the tradeoff decision you talked about earlier about deposit growth against maybe some of the promotional pricing or things you did together new accounts and bring in deposits can you talk a little bit about that tradeoff decision that you guys made ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think from a big picture perspective there were a couple of variables one we made a conscious decision to go shorter right on our liability side so we could have extended or kept it the same duration as we were having before but when we started to see some movement in november and sort of where the expectations were maybe even a little bit earlier where still the curve was on that short end we definitely moved a little bit shorter so that definitely negatively impacted the interest expense for the quarter we do think that therell be a positive impact to that though as we think about where comes out sort of for the full year period and that said from a macro perspective look it was a very challenging year for an organization like ours looking in the beginning of the year what happened with signature what happened with seb and the others and we were really focused on retention of deposits and as a result of that i think we were probably maybe too lenient on some of our clients and acquiescing to some of their rate request we had a lot of money that moved to treasuries right off the bat and that said we were really competing with that today in the conversations we have with clients im not so sure that we needed to necessarily do that and were going back reengaging with our clients again were a bit distracted i think in the fourth quarter based just with the core conversion and probably even in the third quarter even leading up to that core conversion for us getting the core conversion done was important we did it unbelievable i had three email complaints so thats it from valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 clients out of an entire client base its really nothing so there was a lot of focus on retention of clients through that core conversion once again now i just think we get back having appropriate conversations with our clients appropriate conversations when it comes what the pricing should look like and well get the deposits back to an appropriate beta as to what it should look like but i think most importantly we did an unbelievable core conversion we retained all of our clients we actually grew clients through a core conversion which doesnt even necessarily happen we put on as i said household growth in commercial during this year i mean those are unbelievable numbers so while once again i said im not so happy with where the fourth quarter ended up big picture im not that concerned jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah you shouldnt beat yourself up too much its not terrible but just one more thing on net interest income i kind of asked this earlier but it implies a decent step up your guide like about million incremental from the run rate that you had in the fourth quarter do you guys think were near the bottom or at the bottom on net interest income at this point michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so were certainly getting close so let me do this im going to direct everybody to slide because i know that this is a really important topic and when you look at the quarteroverquarter cost increase in deposits youll see that we started off at basis points then we had two consecutive quarters at basis points in the third quarter and the fourth quarter its only basis points so why do we feel better about the direction of nim its mainly that combined with the fact that were starting to see some stabilization in maybe in our noninterestbearing accounts that noninterestbearing rotation going back to indiscernible when we had of our total funding sources in noninterestbearing thats come down to now and december were starting to see some stabilization and when you combine that with the deceleration in the overall cost of deposits thats why we feel like theres some additional increase in our nim as plays out obviously we need fed rate cuts to capture all of that opportunity jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right fair enough thank you guys ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos of jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ira i want to start so when you took over as ceo one of your top priorities was improving the efficiency ratio right and i know it was a rough year for everybody because of what happened with rates and nim pressure etcetera but when i look at the strategic imperatives for im very surprised it felt like you moved the goalpost a bit that improving where we are is not on there is this still a top priority for you and should we expect to see improvement this year ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah look i think the contraction of what we saw in the efficiency ratio is largely just a function of the nim steven right and as we get back to better core funding as we get back to some better diversification that sits within that asset class the nim will definitely expand as a result of that were down i think we were at plus or minus employees when i took over were sitting around today and were billion back then and billion today and i think weve definitely focused on what the efficiency looks like weve definitely embedded technology in here for me its not something thats even called out as a strategic imperative its just indiscernible the core of who we are today i think were very focused obviously on what that efficiency is as i mentioned earlier the technology infrastructure that we put into place allows for scalability which is something thats important to us so the technology the drag and at the cost is for that isnt going to be nearly what it was before so definitely not focusing on it as calling it out isnt something that i want someone to take away and say hey its not a priority for us i think its just day in day out what we do and i think as the nim gets to an appropriate level back to where we think it should be youll see that number get back down to a number that youll be happy with steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right let me ask so if we look at the expenses which were elevated you called out related to the system conversion how much was that in the fourth quarter whats expected at and what comes out in travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah in the operating expense number there was million associated with the core conversion in the first quarter we anticipate thatll be around million so it maybe decline million and then from there on it should be up steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp indiscernible those are really the onetime items or infrequent whatever you want to refer to them as but keep in mind there is dual operating expenses and running those multiple platforms as well during the quarter once we get to a better place which were pretty much right on the verge of youre going to have those being eliminated as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp and i do just want to go back to your efficiency comment steve i mean if you look back a year ago our efficiency ratio was in the fourth quarter of this year but relative to average assets noninterest expenses declined in that same period so i mean i think it is directly obviously its directly tied to the revenue environment that you described but i mean weve talked about the head count reductions so weve seen the limited head count growth over the five years relative to the asset growth that we put on so the efficiency ratio does tend to be more tied to just market dynamics and things both structurally and what we can control i think weve done a very good job steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay let me ask you guys called out that the deposit pricing got a bit away from you because of the system conversion whats the connection between the two ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp we have a lot of relationship clients which an organization our size should have i think we have internal models as to how we look at pricing deposits i think the focus largely on our frontline staff was on reaching out to clients retaining clients and some of the profitability metrics as to how we think about engaging with our clients how we want to direct certain conversations were probably distracted based on client retention and based on just conveying to clients what was going to be new with regards to how they approach the different systems that said i think certain deposit rates from the exception pricing perspective got a little bit out of hand and there wasnt necessarily the focus that should have been on making sure that we were within our targeted guidelines as to what that pricing should be that said im very confident that well get there very very soon steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay if i could ask one last one sorry for all the questions so im trying ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc to square that the nim drivers you said its neutral in the short run but ira you said multiple times your nim should expand i think you said very nicely once the curve looks more normal how long are we talking like whats the lag i would think it would be sooner than later but if we get a positively sloped curve towards the back end of this year is that a story before your nim start to look more normal im just confused why the fed cutting rates given how much youre paying on deposits you guys are one of the higher payers is more beneficial in the short run thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i think right theres the front end curve i think coming down definitely is going to be impactful to us but its the long and where we have a lot more thats tied to its definitely going to be a pretty significant tailwind for us as to how were thinking about where the net interest income is going to go i think the commentary was more along theres some day count issues really that goes into that first quarter as well as were not expecting much change within the first quarter as well so once the curve does begin to normalize we do believe that theres going to be some positive impact to that net interest income and into the margin as well that said theyre really not asking or forecasting anything to really change until the tail end of the first quarter and there is that pressure from a day count right off the bat as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of nick cucharale of hovde group your line is open nicholas cucharale q analyst hovde group llc good morning everyone just a question on the noninterest income outlook what are the primary drivers of the to yearoveryear growth and are you expecting a reversion of swap activity closer to the first half of as opposed to the back half michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so the biggest driver would be as i said earlier stabilization in our noninterestbearing deposit balances but that was the biggest driver of net interest income travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp ph adjusted noninterest income valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp he said noninterest income i missed that sorry about that so you can see that in our ip deck as well it lays out the portions of that keep in mind that in we also had some onetime events related to some revenue recognition that arent going to repeat in the prior year but i think when you look at totality of our fee income we feel very good about where were at because it only generates about of our total revenue sometimes the increases in any one category get lost but i do think given the lower loan growth that we have swap income will be somewhat challenged and will be replaced with things like fx wealth management and we have a very strong treasury management project going on in our company and as we put on more ci business we would expect that to indiscernible income as well nicholas cucharale q analyst hovde group llc okay and then just looking at the expense base as you mentioned some investments and some reduction opportunities throughout now that the core conversion is complete what investments are you most focused on to drive the next leg of growth for the company travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp i think a lot of them lined up with some of the strategic imperatives that we talked about right i mean i think when we think about the growth in the ci and some of the indiscernible businesses that we have theres definitely some technology investments that we put forth that said a lot of it from a foundation perspective is already there its just enhancements at this point for things that were already put in place but really largely aligned with what weve talked about on the strategic side mostly focused on some of the ci stuff nicholas cucharale q analyst hovde group llc thank you travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp thanks operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia of morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning can you talk about how youre thinking about deposit betas and deposit mix as rates come down is there still a lag in how deposit yields come down as rates come down and do ph nib deposits start to rebound once we to a certain level in rates so yeah if you can expand on that and just talk about how youre thinking about deposit cost through maybe the first rate cut versus the next few rate cuts travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 yeah manan this is travis so i do think there is some lag on the beta side on the way down our model assumes around beta on the way down as you can see the cycle today was on the way up relative to noninterestbearing our budget and our forecast assumes that it remains relatively stable as a percentage of total deposits around but i do think there is a terminal point with rates that you do continue to build that back up and obviously as we expand ci and treasury management i mean those are strategic initiatives that are in place to continue to grow noninterest deposits faster than what we actually include in our budget so thats some thoughts around that manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc very helpful on the loan growth guide of to i know that includes some mix shift away from investor cre so can you talk about some of the drivers and also what is the cadence of that look like is that more backend loaded and do you need some help from the environment there or is that based on customer conversations youre having today and theres a high degree of confidence that loan growth will accelerate as we get through this year travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah it is based on the confidence we have in the conversation with customers and seeing the uptick in their requests from us and the build on our pipeline that weve experienced in the fourth quarter and so far into january and again pointing out to the originations in that fourth quarter billion up from that billion in the third quarter and the uptick in our pipelines and cis contribution to that pipeline where it is now the lions share its of our pipeline so we are seeing that activity typically the first quarter is a slow quarter as people get their financial statements in place and you start seeing progressively more business as the quarters roll on manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and the loan to deposit ratio should stay at about these levels of between to travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yes manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of matthew breese of stephens your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good afternoon everybody ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i had a few questions here with me first i was hoping on the nii guide could you provide just for context i would love a sense of how dynamic it is what the guide would be or estimate what the guide would be under a no or minimum rate cut scenario for the year travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp sure its effectively captured in to range that we provided if rates stayed flat then we think that there would still be upside in nii and margin from our current levels again the most exposure we would have is to significantly lower rates on the long end so absent that the most other interest scenarios would end up in the kind of guide that we provided matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and i think you also alluded that the nim has already started to show some stabilization hopefully stabilization in the first quarter could you provide some detail as to how the nim provides on a monthly basis throughout the fourth quarter and if you started to see that stabilization already travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp we did november was the low point i would say on a monthly basis when we were on the call last time we look back at six consecutive months of generally stable nii and margin some of the factors that weve already talked about in terms of shortening up the liabilities and other things provided a little bit of pressure in the fourth quarter but i would say that the margin again was at its low point in november if you look at what we originated loan origination yields also bottomed in november and bounced back in december but new deposit origination costs actually declined throughout the quarter so october was the high point and november was lower and december even lower than that one thing i would throw out there too we do provide obviously in the deck what our loan origination yields are and they declined basis points in the quarter but new deposit origination costs declined basis points in the quarter which kind of feeds into the commentary weve provided on spreads so november again was a low point on the margin december was somewhat better if thats helpful matthew breese q analyst stephens inc yeah any frame of reference for what the difference was low to high travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp it wasnt that significant to be honest i think november was basis points or basis points lower than december matthew breese q analyst stephens inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 got it okay a couple other quick ones i noticed that service charges on deposit accounts was quite a bit lower quartertoquarter like was that driven by the conversion and should we expect that indiscernible to come back to its normal kind of million level travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah so for about a month around the conversion we waived certain transactional fees so if you look at the decline it was about million million thats exactly what that was so otherwise that would have been flat obviously we put on a lot of deposits throughout the fourth quarter customer deposits so that should continue to drive deposit service charges going forward that will also be supplemented by the treasury management stuff that we talked about that generates deposit revenue as well in the noninterest income area matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the average balance sheet it struck me as odd cash balances or interest with bank deposits was down basis points quartertoquarter to i usually look at that as kind of a fed funds proxy what happened there what drove yields down so substantially in cash categories travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp i think youre generally right so we go through an accrual process to estimate what the cash payments received from the fed are the actual payments do tend to move around little bit so there are certain credits that go in and out there so you can have a yield that may not directly align with the interest on overnight reserves matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay but generally speaking we should model that back to fed funds travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah i think thats generally right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay on page of the presentation you showed the multifamily portfolio pretty good detail what struck me was that a number of these geographies have weighted average debt service coverage sub times to me it feels a little bit risky given the repricing dynamics so one im curious those debt service coverage ratios are those at origination or are they updated and then two do you happen to know what the existing loan yield is on this book versus updated ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah the weighted average debt service coverage are current theyre based on recent rent rolls we update that and the loan to values on a regular basis i dont have the loan yield in front of me but i will tell you again when we look at that repricing weve not had to modify any of the terms on our repricing and our forward look valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 where we assess each loan that reprices over the next months we expect the same results but we will have to look that up i dont know if you have it travis travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah we so we i dont have the full portfolio in front of me but ill try and give you some color that may be helpful so as we show on that page matt we have million of fully rent controlled loans those would be the lowest yielding segment and thats yield we have another call it billion id say of exposure to properties that have some amount of rent control in them and that portfolio yields million so i think when you look broadly at multifamily youre going to be closer in total to the million yield give or take matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and those buckets the million of pure rent regulated and the billion of some rent regulated those passed the stress testing you went through as well michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah and its the million thats pure rent regulated and that its billion which is partial are less rent regulated matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and i know im being longwinded but this is my last one ira you had mentioned some frustration with overall profitability levels can you better define for us at which level youd be satisfied profitability wise maybe as measured by roa or rotce and as we think the forward model here when do you think we can get back to lets call it a roa for the bank ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i dont want to go against the guidance that travis provided right but im pretty optimistic about where i think were going to be in we were generating of return on tangible common at the end of last year and i think thats an appropriate level that we should begin to target and we should get back there matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay ill leave it there thanks for taking all my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 25jan2024 operator thank you im showing no further questions at this time ill turn the call back over to ira robbins for any closing remarks ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i just want to say thank you for dialing in today and we look
