management discussion section travis lan senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp good morning and welcome to valleys third quarter earnings conference call presenting on behalf of valley today are ceo ira robbins president tom iadanza and chief financial officer mike hagedorn before we begin i would like to make everyone aware that our quarterly earnings release and supporting documents can be found on our company website at valleycom when discussing our results we refer to non gaap measures which exclude certain items from reported results please refer to todays earnings release for reconciliations of these nongaap measures additionally i would like to highlight slide of our earnings presentation and remind you that comments made during this call may contain forwardlooking statements relating to valley national bancorp and the banking industry valley encourages all participants to refer to our sec filings including those found on forms 8k 10q and 10k for a complete discussion of forwardlooking statements with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis and welcome to those of you on the call today i have a few comments to make this morning and then we ask tom to provide insight on the quarters loan and deposit results mike will then discuss the financial results in more detail valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 in the third quarter of valley reported net income of million earnings per share of and annualized roa of exclusive of noncore charges adjusted net income eps and roa were million and respectively these exceptional results reflect the benefits of our asset sensitive balance sheet and our consistently strong credit results as you are aware valley has undergone a meaningful evolution over the last few years by expanding in terms of both size and capability we have uniquely positioned ourselves as one of the premier service oriented commercial banks in the entire country from a size perspective we sit in an incredibly strong position with only a handful of nationwide peers our customers have access to the robust suite of products and services they would find at a large bank but with valleys exceptional responsiveness and high touch approach this combination has accelerated our brand awareness and enabled us to selectively add top level talent and desirable clients this unique approach also positions us to capitalize on market disruption that may occur as a result of future economic volatility while we remain selective with regards to how and when we grow we believe that times of stress can create exceptional customer acquisition opportunities as the pool of banks that look like valley continue to shrink we are prepared to maintain our momentum and maximize our competitive advantages one of valleys distinguishing characteristics is our positioning in some of the countrys most attractive commercial markets including metro new york florida and california we believe these markets will weather economic downturns while providing unique opportunities for diversified loan and deposit growth our results this quarter reflect the benefits of our diversified business model and the economic strength of our targeted markets of operations before i turn the call over to tom i want to briefly update you on the guidance we had previously provided on page of the deck we compare selected third quarter results to last quarters guidance while we are not formally adjusting our nearterm guidance we believe that the loan growth and net interest income is likely to exceed our prior expectations meanwhile the guidance for our efficiency ratio and tax rates remain unchanged with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss this quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide illustrates the quarters annualized loan growth which is below the mid20 organic growth rate from the second quarter while loan originations slowed during the third quarter net growth is above the high end of our anticipated range as a result of two key factors first as interest rates have increased faster than anticipated payoffs have slowed dramatically second contributions from the residential and consumer portfolios exceeded expectations partially as a result of crosssell to legacy leumi customers on the commercial side our growth remains well diversified across asset classes and geographies we have selectively tightened underwriting standards which led to lower loantovalues and higher debt service coverages on originations during the quarter we also continue to see a significant amount of loan production to repeat customers these borrowers are sophisticated and well known to valley and come back to us time and again to benefit from our responsiveness and strong execution as ira mentioned we have continued to add talented commercial bankers across our footprint this is consistent with our proven ability to enhance our franchise particularly in times of disruption around us these efforts should valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 help us offset a broader slowdown in demand and be additive to our loan and deposit production in and beyond finally on slide you can see the basis point increase in average new origination yields to during the quarter as you would expect origination yields increased each month as market rates moved higher this is a positive indicator that we are able to pass through higher rates to our borrowers and we anticipate that origination yields will continue to ascend turning to slide you can see that deposits grew at an annualized rate of approximately during the quarter as we have previously discussed we have devoted significant resources to diversifying our deposit gathering channels over the last few years while certain of our funding sources have become more competitive weve been able to tap other customer segments and business lines to fund our loan growth as an example we have seen private banking customers take advantage of higher rates by redeploying deposits into the treasury securities market to offset this and support growth we rolled out retail cd promotions over the summer which generated over billion of new deposits these promotions were timed in advance of fed hikes and have added duration at rates that are extremely attractive in retrospect we continue to focus on the deposit side and acknowledge that each fed hike brings more pricing and competition we are tactically managing our business lines to ensure that we generate deposits in the most costeffective manner to support our loan growth with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide more insight on the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends net interest income increased over million or over from the linked quarter the increase reflects continued loan growth and the benefits of our assetsensitive balance sheet and a rising interest rate environment these factors more than offset a sequential reduction in ppp income and pcd accretion which fell to million and million in the second quarter this was primarily the result of slower acquired loan payoffs our third quarter fully tax equivalent net interest margin increased basis points to from the second quarter of asset yields expanded basis points during the quarter which more than offset a basis point increase in total funding costs the asset yield increase was driven by both the repricing of our floating rate loans and a significant increase in the yields on newly originated loans as you saw on slide we calculate a cumulative yeartodate deposit beta of approximately this is running better than modeled so far but as tom noted we acknowledge the competitive landscape and are working hard to ensure this trend continues using the implied forward curve at september we anticipate net interest margin will increase further in both the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of net interest margin results beyond that point will be more dependent on our ability to acutely manage future deposit betas moving to slide we generated over million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to million in the second quarter the reduction was driven by lower gain on sale income resulting from a decline in conforming residential loan production swap and other marketbased revenues were generally stable during the quarter on the swap side we anticipate that revenue could revert from million this quarter to the high single digit level in the fourth quarter should loan origination activity decline further valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 on slide you can see that our total noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter or approximately million on an adjusted basis the quarters adjusted expenses included million charitable contribution and higher incentive compensation accruals related to our strong financial performance outside of these discrete costs additional expense increases generally reflect the inflationary environment and the competitive talent market the quarters strong revenue growth helped drive our efficiency ratio to from the second quarters level as ira said we remain confident in our previous sub50 efficiency ratio guidance for the second half of turning to slide you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters our allowance for credit losses as a percentage of total loans declined to at september from at june we assessed our portfolio in the wake of hurricane ian and determined there was no significant impact to our required reserves at september we continue to support our impacted customers and employees as they recover from the storm as a reminder our reserve coverage remains well above the day one reserve we established upon the adoption of cecl in neither our earnings and our capital levels have benefited from reserve releases which differentiates us from many of our peers during the quarter we experienced a positive resolution of certain nonaccrual credits this resulted in nearly million of net recoveries and a sequential reduction in nonaccrual loans as compared to june relative to non accrual loans the reserve increased to from at june on slide you can see that tangible book value increased approximately for the quarter this was the result of our strong earnings and a modest negative oci impact associated with our availableforsale securities portfolio relative to peers our oci headwind remains manageable as a result of our smaller securities portfolio and modest afs exposure which reflects our continued focus on tangible book value preservation tangible common equity to tangible assets declined slightly as a result of our loan growth our tier ratios were stable during the quarter and total risk base increased as a result of our successful subordinated debt offering in september with that i will turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 question and answer section operator the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from michael perito from kbw please proceed michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys good morning thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start on the deposit side i guess you kind of have a two tapes here obviously in the quarter itself the betas were pretty reasonable and you had the nice nim expansion but obviously the just on a dollar basis the mix of growth was very cd and brokered cd heavy and some of the rate hikes were a little later in the quarter so i guess im just curious as we look to next quarter here how do you guys expect the mix of deposit growth to trend i mean is it going to continue to be very cd and brokered cd have is there room for other kind of verticals or areas to contribute more and i guess as a followup to that i mean depending on what you answer there i mean can betas accelerate pretty meaningfully next quarter do you think theres still room to kind of keep those at reasonable rates or how are you guys thinking about that dynamic thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hey michael its tom we have over the past few years built a number of verticals that are growing at rates that are a little bit higher than what our traditional core deposits are growing and thats those are the hoa cannabis national deposit groups as well as an emphasis on our valley direct product we will continue to see growth in those areas that will outpace our traditional core equally important is that our relationshipdriven commercial model results in net increases in business accounts each and every quarter those accounts tend to be noninterestbearing deposits we will continue to focus we dont have a reliance on any single niche well continue to focus on these niches the average deposit cost total deposit costs for september was basis points ill just remind everyone our loan yields for that same month of september were approaching so we have a number of levers a number of verticals that will continue to push michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp as it relates to the betas mike our modeling on a forward basis shows that were going to have margin expansion our expectation is that well have margin expansion in both the fourth quarter and the first quarter of our modeling also includes a very wide range of deposit betas for those incremental costs and even with that were still showing net interest income growth full year to full year so we feel pretty good about where we sit right now valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp and i just want to clarify on toms comment on the loan origination yields approaching on the origination side michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all helpful guys thanks for running through that i guess just as a followup then i mean why i guess is it the range of outcomes that keeps the nii guide from changing here i mean it sounds like that just based on what you laid out it would be a reasonably confident statement to say that youll be above that million but obviously you guys didnt formally change that so is that just uncertainty over the next three months or is there any other dynamic that we should be thinking about as we model kind of the nearterm nii trajectory travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp mike this is travis so no theres confidence that the nii is going to continue to grow in the fourth quarter i mean as mike said the margin is going to we anticipate the margin will go higher in the fourth quarter and again in the first quarter so nii will continue to expand we just didnt formally update the guidance because it was only one quarter i think everyones going to be waiting to see what the guidance looks like in january so its more a formality than anything else as you saw i mean we were on pace with the fourth with the third quarter nii to be ahead of that million guide and were growing from there michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect yes thats what i figured i just wanted to double check and then just lastly maybe a question for mike any thoughts i mean the efficiency ratio guidance is unchanged you guys were just under this quarter quarteronquarter although the expense rate stepped up a bit i mean just anything youd flag out there and as you guys continue to invest to grow the business and the diversity of the business i mean any initial budgeting thoughts on growth rate on the opex side for next year even if its just kind of qualitative commentary ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey michael this is ira i think just high level were really focused on generating positive operating leverage if you see for the quarter we were at times which we think is really trending in the right direction for us and consistent with where weve been over the last few years of how we think about growth and balancing that with the expenses across the entire organization as tom mentioned though we think there is going to be significant opportunity for us based on the economic environment we hired 20plus frontline bankers last year on the commercial side and weve done the same thing so far this year so the expense guide or as you see the expenses increase for us its really in relation to what were seeing on the asset side of the balance sheet as well we try not to manage any one individual component of the financial statements and sort of independently but rather much more so in the aggregate and were really seeing the benefits of that today michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great ill let someone else come in but thank you guys for taking my questions appreciate it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi from piper sandler please proceed frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning frank michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co i wondered if just a followup on the deposit kind of storyline i dont know you might even have mentioned but i would think its fair to assume that just given the environment that the bank leumis technologyfocused deposits would have been down quarteroverquarter and if thats the case just wondering your thoughts there on trend could those perhaps have stabilized which would lead to less dependence on cd growth in thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp on the venture tech side at leumi the deposits were stable for the quarter we do expect a little bit more volatility going into the fourth quarter but were optimistic and were very proud of the longterm prospects of that business we expect it to be a longterm deposit growth opportunity for us travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp frank this is travis i mean interestingly the acquired leumi business where we saw the most pressure on the deposit side was on the private banking ira and tom mentioned that in his prepared remarks but folks that were sitting there with deposits and no yield alternatives for multiple years and then turn around and get treasuries in the area we saw them take deposits out and invest in the treasury market which they do through our broker dealer so we preserved the customer relationship it could benefit economically there but thats actually the area that saw the pressure candidly across the organization from a deposit perspective frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay and are you still seeing kind of that story play out here in the fourth quarter valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp i think therell be nearterm volatility in those portfolios as rate rise and such but again longterm its still a very important and solid business for us michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah and i would just add to that that even though you see the rotation out of noninterestbearing which many of the peers have experienced as well the stability of the other verticals that we built have really weathered the storm for us on that rotation and that goes back to travis comments in the wealth space as well the money that was at zero is a little longer sleepy and its going to start earning some rate of interest the thing were most excited about is through the cycle right now for total deposits our beta is only so i mean im not saying its going to be in the fourth quarter please dont make that jump but through the cycle right now considering the history of our company when we had a different balance sheet mix i think is pretty doggone good performance at this point frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co well thinking about the cd promotions i think they were correct me if im wrong but sort of done at an opportune time earlier in the third quarter im just kind of curious if you could talk about is there any sort of similar promotions going on currently and kind of whats the pricing there that youre seeing thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah we have a promotion now for months on the cd and were seeing a lot of positive activity began a little over a week ago we also have a valley direct product a highyield savings at around and in the last quarter we opened up over new accounts there so we are seeing traction at rates that give us a little more duration and there will be attractive rates michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and frank as a reminder to your comment around what weve done opportunistically before fed increases weve raised over billion on two other cd promotions at rates less than so thats one of those things thats really been helping to buoy our overall deposit beta frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay and then if i just could sneak in one last one on the expense side as well is there any reason to sort of as we look at the fourth quarter i know you provided your guide and under were very confident in terms of the efficiency ratio just wondering if theres any reason to think some of those accruals in the quarter might have been a little bit frontloaded i guess is the a pretty good run rate expectation all else equal as we go into the fourth quarter here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 sure appreciate the question im going to direct everybodys attention on the call to slide in the deck as a reminder the adjusted expenses are million for the quarter and if you back out the million that we talked about for the charitable contribution which obviously we dont expect that to continue in the fourth quarter you start to look at the other increases and the good news i think from our perspective it goes back to the comments that tom made earlier about hiring new producers within our company the majority of that cost increase is in the salary and compensationrelated lines so to the extent that theres recessionary pressure there which i think everybody is experiencing i think its fair to say that thats right i think a kind of base rate going forward at least for the fourth quarter expenses is million and then you can build your growth on top of that relative to a sub50 efficiency ratio frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thank you michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thanks frank operator our next question comes from dave bishop from hovde group please proceed david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning gentlemen how are you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey david how are you david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc good good hey i was just curious with the leumi acquisition behind you just the appetite for share buybacks here ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think theres so much opportunity for us to really continue the growth trajectory of the organization and i think the best use of our capital is to continue to leverage it into the balance sheet and provide capital for the loan originations internally so i think thats probably more likely than a share repurchase at this point david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it and then overall credit looks fine but any color you guys can provide on the rise in the earlystage delinquencies the construction and commercial real estate credits thanks valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah there was a single construction loan that moved into the nonaccrual bucket the collateral is fine we have guarantees on it we dont expect any loss there in total our nonaccruals declined from basis points to basis points and that was all due to positive resolution of some older loans that we had on the books with primarily full repayment on each of them david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it thanks operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steven michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i like to start and dive a little deeper into the noninterestbearing deposit outflows in the quarter so if i look prior to the pandemic you were about mid20 mix of noninterestbearing now thats about mid where do you see this level normalizing to and could we go below michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp as a reminder in september of i believe we were around give or take sorry and we peaked in the prior quarter at just under and now were at so we feel pretty good about the retention that weve seen here i think what youre seeing in our numbers and youre probably seeing in other banks numbers is at some point on the interest rate cycles especially in this cycle theres a place where people are no longer going to leave as much in noninterestbearing as they did before so its about effective use of their capital mostly relates back to the commercial space so we feel pretty good about how weve been able to hold our own in that space but in any event if some of that money moves to us were not losing those accounts so as tom mentioned earlier our account basis in the commercial space has gone up ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 i think just from a more broad perspective steve the composition of the balance sheet has changed dramatically since then much more focused on the commercial deposit versus the consumer deposit and as you know those carry higher noninterestbearing deposits from an operating account and payroll account perspective as well as just the shift in bringing in leumi and what their funding base look like as well so i dont anticipate at all going back down to those levels steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so could we read into this that you think you could maintain about mid about where you are now so the mix doesnt change that much moving forward ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think theres a lot of pressure externally you saw billion flow out of the banking space so i think there is going to be some pressure i think the diversified funding mix that weve created here is really providing us the ability to continue the growth without having to look to the borrowings market marketplace that said i think the beta isnt going to be much less than what they were last time and steve if you look at we had impact in beta this quarter just because of the growth that we put on so i think on a core basis as tom was referring to we are getting the real benefit of the diversified funding book the retail branches are doing well all across the individual geographies and the focus on the commercial customer versus maybe the ph cre customer is really supporting balances as well our commercial customers give us between and balances that come along with that growth if you look back to when we had i think as you were referencing earlier when we were in the mid of the balance sheet was excuse me yes of the balance sheet now is sitting with fixed and on the adjustable side and that was really switched from where we were before so weve seen significant did i get that wrong michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp you got it wrong ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp the other way right michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp is adjustable is fixed and within the adjustable portion of that would reprice in the next three months ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp right so that massive shift valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp the total portfolio ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yes so that massive shift in asset base reflects the change in the deposit composition as well that really comes along with it so on a macro basis its a much more assetsensitive balance sheet and the funding structure looks much better as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ira if we put this together what should we assume for the throughthecycle deposit beta for you guys ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i dont think i want to give guidance on that specifically but i think its going to be much better than what we were historically steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp we wont give guidance but i will say this steven on the low end of our modeling at beta to the highend in our modeling of and we have all kinds of points in between there our net interest income still grows on a yearoveryear basis so we feel very confident right now that were going to continue to grow margin in the fourth quarter and the first quarter as we said in our prepared remarks its a little murkier after that but on a net interest income perspective the numbers look solid steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then one final one for me just given the inverted curve and rising deposit costs how should we think about holding residential mortgage loans beyond this year should we expect that to continue thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp no steven just your point of reference were only holding jumbo mortgages in portfolio there was a small portion of conforming that closed too late in the third quarter about million to be sold in the third quarter they will be sold in the fourth quarter so we continue to only hold jumbos not conforming steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc not conforming okay thanks for taking my questions valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steve operator our next question comes from matthew breese from stephens inc please proceed matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i was hoping for a little bit more guidance on accretable yield that came down this quarter i think to million im just curious what we should be using on a run rate basis there travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah matt this is travis so we were at million last quarter million this quarter the reduction is because payoffs slowed dramatically i mean i think anywhere in that range is reasonable if you want to pick the midpoint i think thats fine with where rates are maybe you use the million for the next few quarters but i dont anticipate that it would move significantly lower than this matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then thinking back historically valley has operated more or less in a kind of interest rate neutral position curious over time will you look to go back to that kind of interest rate position perhaps lock in some of these that the margin gains youve had more recently or do you expect to maintain the assetsensitive position michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes its mike thanks for the question matt yes we are currently exploring some options to lock in some of that as you said new interest income or some of that margin that weve gained during this upward rate environment so we are looking at that and i do think over time you would see us migrate back to a somewhat more neutral balance sheet position matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then just tying two thoughts together right you had mentioned nim expansion through the early part of plus perhaps locking some of this in the extent we see some nim pressure on the back of the fed stopping hikes to what extent might we see that pressure or do you expect it to be more of a stabilizing point versus real pressure valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah matt this is travis so i mean our margins at this quarter right were up from about or so two quarters ago thats significant increase in the last two quarters were going to grow for another two quarters although likely at i think a slower pace than what youve seen so far but then even when you see the pressure right i think we all believe that were going to see our margin even out somewhere well above kind of that low level so maybe its not the area that we would ultimately level out following the conclusion of the fed hikes but i think the margin is going to stabilize at a higher level than what youve seen historically for this company matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and im sorry did you provide a was there a number in there like a or number you think it will stabilize at travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp i was just using this quarters like the reference points were going to grow two more quarters and then at some point if you see the pressure i mean i think youre going to normalize in this kind of mid3 level matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay last one for me just on fee income any sort of guidance there i know theres a number of different business lines now kind of working curious if that kind of million million range is a good one going forward michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah we feel pretty good about that range right now i mean obviously the resi mortgage business is going to continue to be challenged as it was in the quarter but yes we think thats probably in the ballpark matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay thats all i had thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks matt operator our next question comes from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets please proceed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning everyone valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning jon thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp good morning jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a couple of followups ira question for you in your early in your prepared comments i think you used the term times of stress give you opportunities to grow does this feel like a time of stress for you and it sounds like youve got some opportunities to grow but help us understand that word stress ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think its beginning to feel like it youre seeing definitely some contraction in gdp overall i think theres still inflationary pressures that are being addressed obviously by the fed but you look at the balance sheet right and people are migrating deposits outside of traditional financial banks which is impacting obviously the ability to fund but that said i think for us specifically the credit quality is holding up i keep on going back to what our performance was in the beginning of covid we had a significantly 30plus billion balance sheet and we only had a modified million of our loans during that time period really demonstrates to me the way that we underwrote day one and the ability of our borrowers to continue to perform in a challenging economic environment so for us i feel really really good about our opportunities to continue to grow opportunity to support our customers and to add new customers for others id be a bit concerned jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and then on your loan growth pace help us understand just kind of environmental versus market share gains you still had a good growth quarter and i know we talked a little bit last quarter about some of your new markets but is the environment healthy and is that providing opportunities or are these market share gains and just help us think through how you view in terms of indiscernible thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp what were most proud of is that our growth is very balanced across regions types of businesses types of product types of collateral we continue with that balanced growth and were seeing accelerated growth in our newer florida market more so than the stable markets up here in the midwest and were seeing growth in california we entered new markets in philadelphia nashville atlanta we continue to see opportunities there and growth there we have added ira mentioned we added frontend people including three in our venture business two in new york one in palo alto so were getting lift through these added people through the new markets that were entering and staffing into those new markets but i just want to stress weve done this without compromising any credit standards weve tightened our underwriting standards our weighted average loantovalue is around on our new production our weighted valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27oct2022 average debt service coverage is over on the ci side its even higher its over times on that debt service coverage calculation that we have and overall of our businesses to our existing customer base on the construction side its closer to to existing customer base so the balance of that growth utilizing our existing customers leumi and the westchester bank are benefiting from a much larger balance sheet leumi growth is annualized and is coming from existing customer base well continue to see the benefit of that but well guide our guidance is to growth for the fourth quarter and high singledigits for jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay thats helpful and then mike just one for you you got a lot of questions on deposits and growth obviously but any cap on your loantodeposit ratio when you guys think through it youve operated above in the past but how do you think about the loantodeposit ratio or is that just not a concern or limitation for you thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp we dont provide like specific guidance but i think that when you look at us relative to the midsized bank peers in the billion to billion range i think its advantageous for us to the extent we can do this in a cost effective way and also not turn away any growth so one of the things we want to make sure that we never do is be in a position where we cant fund the good loan growth that toms team puts on day in and day out so that typically means that wed like to keep at billion or less if it came up a little bit above billion its been much higher historically a little bit above billion i think would be okay but theres not a goal to necessarily keep it there but assuming we can do it cost effectively wed like to be less than billion jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks for the help appreciate it ira d robbins
