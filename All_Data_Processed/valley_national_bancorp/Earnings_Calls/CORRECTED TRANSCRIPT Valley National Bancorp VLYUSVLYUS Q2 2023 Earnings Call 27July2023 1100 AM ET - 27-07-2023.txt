and the factors that could cause actual results to differ from those statements with that ill turn the call over to ira robbins ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis in the second quarter of valley reported net income of million and earnings per share of exclusive of noncore items adjusted net income and eps were million and respectively the quarterly results were highlighted by strong and stable asset quality metrics consistent loan activity improved deposit generation and solid noninterest income growth the interest rate environment continues to create cyclical pressures for traditional spread banks like valley we have conservatively positioned our balance sheet in a neutral manner which is both prudent and generates largely stable net interest income in varying interest rate environments the current inverted curve pressures this approach yet over the long run we believe it is appropriate we firmly believe franchise value is not created by taking interest rate positions but rather by increasing clients and diversifying the balance sheet the current cyclical pressure with the inverted curve will ultimately normalize and the recent client growth realized by valley would generate significant value outside of the cyclical variables impacting profitability the banking environment has recently undergone structural changes related to the movement of money these changing trends will have longterm implications to the banking environment our investment in technology over the last few years both from a client and internal operating perspective coupled with the diversity of our balance sheet will mitigate some of these structural changes and ultimately position valley to capitalize on the evolutionary changes in which clients interact with their financial institutions during my tenure we have focused on consistent tangible book value growth as a key driver of longterm shareholder value while recent market disruption has overshadowed these efforts i am extremely proud of the near increase in tangible book value over the last five years in fact when adjusting for the common cash dividend paid we have generated over growth in tangible book value since march of as the market returns to ph valuing banks on fundamentals our consistent tangible book value growth will continue to be differentiating as we move forward in an effort to offset certain cyclical revenue headwinds we began to implement a cost saving exercise in late june we remain focused on sustainable longterm growth but acknowledge that we need to flexibly respond to nearterm pressures our identified phase will primarily come from lower head count more efficient thirdparty consulting and service usage and specific technology ph saves these opportunities are expected to generate more than million of annual pretax savings and will be realized over the next four quarters culturally we are reinvigorating the attention to detail which drove our efficiency improvement from the high range in the beginning of my tenure to the low range in late consistent with our history we will continue to position ourselves to capitalize on the dislocation around us we anticipate that there will be significant growth opportunities as the environment stabilizes and the yield curve ultimately normalizes values valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 are strong and vibrant institution operating in great markets i remain extremely confident in our ability to execute and im incredibly excited for what the future holds for our company with that i would turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide illustrates the billion growth in our total deposits during the quarter which reflects the ongoing shift to higher cost products the overwhelming majority of noninterest bearing deposit runoff occurred by midmay since then both noninterest bearing and interest bearing transaction balances have been materially unchanged the quarters growth reflects accelerated cd generation which pressured our deposit beta and weighed on our net interest margin slide provides more detail on the continued diversity of our deposit portfolio many of our specialty verticals continue to perform well as we saw solid growth within our online channel and our national deposits of private banking areas the greater utilization of insurance products like ics we have continued to reduce our adjusted uninsured deposit exposure adjusted uninsured deposit balances declined to billion with of total deposits and are now covered more than by on balance sheet cash and available liquidity slide further illustrates the diversity and granularity of our deposit base no commercial industry accounts for more than of our deposits our government portfolio remains diversified across our footprint and is fully collateralized relative to state collateral requirements turning to slide you can see an overview of our loan growth and portfolio composition annualized loan growth slowed to from in the first quarter while origination yields continue to climb we have worked through the majority of the strong pipeline that existed coming into the year and anticipate midsingle digit annualized growth for the remainder of we will continue to be selective on the lending side and generally supportive of compelling projects led by our highquality and tenured customer base slide further illustrates the diversity of our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography as a reminder we have an extremely granular loan portfolio with an average loan size of roughly million from a metric perspective our weighted average ltv and debt service coverage ratio remained at and times respectfully we believe these metrics compare favorably to peers as we have consistently and conservatively underwritten to higher cap rates our experience with recent refinancing activity has been positive given the adequacy of our past underwriting discipline slide provides additional detail on our granular office portfolio loan to values declined during the quarter and our office portfolio remains wellpositioned with a low average loan size with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight on the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends the sequential million decline in net interest income was approximately half of the reduction experienced in the first quarter of the year while asset yields continue to improve deposit mix shift in the firsthalf of the quarter and continued pricing competition drove funding costs higher valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 our fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined basis points versus basis points in the first quarter of we estimate that our elevated average cash position indiscernible weighed on the absolute margin by approximately basis points as you saw on slide our cumulative deposit beta increased to in the quarter during the quarter we enhanced our efforts to extend duration on the funding side to this end we added approximately billion of cds beyond nine months and put on incremental fhlb funding out three years we will continue to focus on prudent balance sheet management and further enhancing our maturity ladder as opportunities present themselves while noninterest deposit balances have been stable since midmay as total deposits grow we anticipate that the contribution of noninterest deposits will decline into the low20 range through the cycle betas now appear likely to peak out at the mid range by yearend as a result of these factors we anticipate that our full year net interest income growth will be in the low singledigit percent range we are seeing initial signs of stabilization in net interest income and margin and increasingly expect that we are approaching a trough moving to slide we generated over million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to million in the first quarter we saw strong growth in a variety of noninterest businesses during the quarter capital markets revenue increased million primarily due to stronger swap activity we also saw growth in our wealth management and insurance lines and a modest rebound in gain on sale revenue while we continue to diversify our revenue sources we are pleased that stronger fee income results helped to slow revenue compression as compared to the first quarter on slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter or approximately million on an adjusted basis the increase in adjusted expenses from the first quarter was largely related to a higher fdic assessment and consulting costs expenses in other categories were generally well controlled as ira mentioned we have identified over million of annualized expense opportunities which we have begun to execute on during the quarter we took approximately million of restructuring charges primarily in the form of severance associated with these efforts while these saves will take time to materialize we expect that they will help to offset potential revenue pressure and more regular expense growth over the next few quarters we expect that just less than half of the annualized saves will be in our run rate by the end of the year with the rest of the saves to be achieved by the midpoint of these expense efforts should help to get efficiency back on track and we will continue to focus on opportunities beyond the million that we have already identified coming into the year we set a expense growth guide of between and we continue to feel this is a reasonable level and believe these initiatives could bring us towards the lower end of that range turning to slide you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters nonaccrual loans were effectively flat at of total loans and early stage delinquencies declined by nearly from the linked quarter second quarter net charge offs were normalized as well with nearly coming from a single fully reserved construction loan charge off we have proactively addressed discrete problem credits in the last few quarters and the data we see continues to indicate asset quality strength in the near term on slide you can see that tangible book value increased approximately for the quarter this was the result of our retained earnings which was partially offset by a modest increase in the oci impact associated with valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 our available for sale securities portfolio tangible common equity to tangible assets rebounded to during the quarter as we repaid maturing shortterm debt with excess cash we estimate that our remaining excess cash position at june weighed on our tce to ta ratio by approximately basis points for the second quarter our cet1 and tier ratios were effectively flat our total risk based ratio declined somewhat as a result of a partial disallowance of the legacy subordinated debt instruments with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will conduct the questionandanswer session operator instructions one moment while we compile the qa roster our first question comes from the line of michael perito with kbw your line is open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions this morning i wanted to start on just a couple clarification questions around some of the guidance you guys just provided i guess first on the opex side so mike basically it sounds like less than contribution of the million is expected to kind of maybe put you at the lowend of the to range can you just remind us that thats off of kind of at the adjusted expense number not the gaap number correct and would you generally agree with that summary travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah thats accurate mike this is travis so the base in was our reported expenses less merger charges and then that to growth was based on that and again exmerger charges for comparison michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect and then are you guys expecting any other noise in the fdic insurance premium line moving forward here just what are your expectations around that at this point travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah mike its travis again so in our initial analysis of the potential special assessment associated with the first two bank failures the number looks to be in the million range obviously thats for us based on our assessment base thats our preliminary analysis still to be confirmed michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right and thats until the end of correct valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp its correct it plays out over eight periods i think just going back with the accounting folks this morning i think you may accrue for it all day one but still need to confirm that as well michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right perfect thanks and then just around the nii outlook so i mean it sounds like theres expected to be maybe another step lower in the third quarter and then some stabilization i mean does that kind of jive also in terms of that nii dollar guide you gave mike but does that jive also maybe with kind of what youre expecting at this point of trajectory of nim i mean is there another step lower here and then based on where the curve is today and the movement yesterday that your hope would be especially with the growth taking maybe a few basis points step back on a net basis to stabilize as well or are there other factors over the back half of the year we should be thinking about michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so based on our modeling right now and the use of the implied forward curve the forecast implies a flat nii so i think its going to be flattish heading into third quarter give or take a few basis points by the way and then also its important to remember as we mentioned that when you take the excess cash off you get back to an adjusted nim of ph so i think as we work that cash down in the third quarter we also see that help increase the nim a little bit michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect and then ill just do one more and then im sure others have questions as well but just ira maybe just would love your thoughts around you know you guys were able to do a couple really productive ma transactions leading into this current environment over the last handful of years obviously right now the ma outlook is a little challenged but you know i imagine at some point there will be some opportunities and im just curious at your current size with everything going on in the market what are your just updated thoughts generally on the ma opportunity for value longer term understanding its not probably something thats on the nearterm agenda but just would love your thoughts there ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks ian its definitely not something that were focused on from a prioritization perspective i think organically theres a lot of excitement within the organization based on some of the verticals that weve done and just indiscernible capabilities that weve established over the last few years so definitely inwardly focused at this point in time that said i think as we think about ma there are definitely going to be opportunities for us to continue to grow from a strategic perspective and anytime we see something that fits within the financial discipline that were focused on that could accelerate some of the strategic objectives that we are looking at we would definitely be open to it right now i think the industry environment creates a bit more challenges when it comes to that though valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect that makes sense thank you guys for all the color this morning i appreciate it ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stifel your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning everybody ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning matt michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey mike just on the normalized liquidity commentary what are you kind of defining as normalized liquidity and how soon do you get there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think its in roughly in the range of about a billion when were in a normal environment obviously when you compare us to peers you saw in the first quarter a significant build you saw that retain some of that build throughout the second quarter but i think somewhere in that midish billion is probably normal go forward for us in what would be considered a normal economy matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay can you provide a little bit more color on perhaps when your model shows a normal economy michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i think were headed that direction right now i think our belief right now is we model forward especially for nii around further fed rate increases as that this increase that happened yesterday is the last one and so that normalizes the economy going forward there are some adjustments obviously the unemployment and gdp in there but overall i think were starting to get there its the beginning of it is the best way of saying it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay i appreciate all the commentary on demand deposits remaining stable after midmay how does the nim progress through the quarter and did you start to see similar signs of stability towards the end of the quarter travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp matt this is travis so on a monthly basis the margin was generally flat throughout the quarter we ended june at which was the quarterly number as well id say that there was a little bit more excess liquidity throughout the quarter as opposed to the june margin so cash adjusted maybe june was down somewhat there clearly signs of stabilization is pretty consistent as you said i mean demand deposits were generally flat over the last two or three months thats kind of continued so our model conservatively projects more compression from noninterest deposit outflows but its not really what weve experienced so far matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and equitable yield was that like a similar kind of million number for the quarter travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah allin purchase accounting income declined million from the first quarter matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay so million travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah correct matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then the last one for me fee income a lot of items went your way this quarter maybe just a little bit of help there what the guidance looks like for the next couple of quarters and i was surprised to see how strong commercial swap fees were maybe just some insight as to what happened underneath the hood over there thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp sure hey matt its tom yeah the fees were strong for the quarter swaps its just a bigger demand on the swap front from our customer base and we expect for the next two quarters to report in the mid on the fee income well offset some of it through our newly you know the tax credit business has a seasonal uptick in the fourth quarter and weve been doing a lot more indiscernible finance through the products we received from leumi valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great i will leave it there i appreciate taking my questions thank you operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start on the noninterest bearing deposits the outflows accelerated a bit this quarter i think you were calling for mid25ish percentage by yearend youre there already i think now ph youre saying down to low range could you take us behind the scenes in terms of why thats coming at even lower than you guys expected are companies just optimizing to a lower level of operating balance michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think there are two main points to consider there steve first were starting to see and were continuing to see consumers utilize their checking accounts for purchases and some of our commercial treasury optimization from our customers standpoint as they manage their cash balances more precisely the other thing that is important to note that over the longterm history of valley the average noninterest bearing as a percent of total deposits has only been so were not that far off of what the average is for a longer period of time that obviously incorporates a lot of different economic environments steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats helpful and im curious the original guidance on the efficiency ratio was around for the fullyear clearly you are running above that taken the nii guide down now so whats a more reasonable target for the efficiency ratio for this year michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah and i think for the full year in the lower with the help of the million annualized expenses that we announced but again obviously not all those are going to be realized on the income statement in but i think it will help us get to the lower range valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then final question the loan growth is pretty strong and you had quite a bit of growth in commercial real estate its an area were not seeing many banks grow give some color on what youre seeing there why you feel comfortable taking on more commercial real estate here thanks thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hey steve its tom our focus has really been on servicing our longterm existing customers that commercial real estate growth came from our customer base still very granular the metrics of a debt service coverage over times which is consistent with our historical underwriting and loan to value is in the range so were bringing them on to existing customers solid projects with the same credit metrics to underwriting standards that we have always used you will see quarterly annualized growth in ci and thats been consistent for the past several quarters so we continue to drive our ci business which gives us deposit and additional fee opportunities while servicing those strong longterm real estate customers steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it then theres midsingle digit loan growth for the rest of the year i havent worked out the math yet how does that change the prior outlook was ph to for the full year thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp we should be at the higher end of that ph to range steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp thanks steve operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i just wanted to followup on the last set of questions on nib deposits so i think you said that nib deposits have been stable since midmay and yet youre saying that your guidance bakes in further outflows as clients optimize their cash so im just trying to square the two are you being more conservative or is that based on in any conversations youre having with clients maybe where ecr rates are going or even any flows that youve seen quartertodate in valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah its none of those things indiscernible started out with that were being a little more conservative on our estimate right now as we take a look at have we reached the absolute bottom of customers rotating into interest bearing products and we dont think were quite there yet manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and i think last quarter you had mentioned that the deposits were coming in around like towards the end of the quarter can you tell us what the number is for june michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah in june we generated new deposits new customer deposits at a blended rate of manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right perfect and then just a question for me on loans some of your peers have announced loan sales during the quarter particularly in commercial real estate is that an opportunity that youre looking at or you could look at in the future michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah at this point were not looking at that were comfortable with our return and risk requirements within our portfolio that said if something compelling comes along thats the right economics and allows us to redeploy into higher value capital opportunities we would certainly look at it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of steve moss with raymond james your line is open steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc hi good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steve michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning steve valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just on loan yields im just curious where is loan pricing these days in terms of just what is the total addon yield i know you guys typically talk in spreads but just kind of curious as to are you in the for loan pricing these days or just have to think about that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah hey steve the loan yields for the quarter was around ph for june it was just about weve been consistently receiving spreads in the mid for the past several quarters the new business new production were putting on its coming at a higher spread than historical levels steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and then in terms of the cumulative deposit beta i think i heard mid earlier it kind of sounds like you guys think the margin maybe troughs here or maybe deposit costs peak in the fourth quarter i should say and stabilized for is kind of how you guys are thinking about it right now just want to make sure i heard that correctly michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i think thats a fair assumption also were starting to see weve been seeing this but we started to see in the second quarter a very nice ramp up in the generation of new accounts so as an example new depository accounts were at the highest level theyve been in the prior six quarters in two quarter or second quarter of so i think we have the migration of noninterest bearing interest bearing which is going to impact your beta you also have the ability to add new deposits as well those incremental new deposits probably come on a little higher cost but the engine that weve created obviously shows as i mentioned that were at the highest level in the last months ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp steve one of the things i think that impacts that is the decline in some of the projected loan growth we were growing in the first quarter this last quarter as we guide towards the midsingle digits after the next two quarters the demand for deposits are going to decline within the organization as well so that should have a significant impact on what this forwardlooking betas look like steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay appreciate all that and maybe just one more thing in terms of dynamic of slowing loan growth here how much do you think is customer conservatism versus wider spreads here going forward just kind of any sense you have for the economy and how customers are michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah hey steve its really both are a factor certainly the widening spreads has had customers relook at the value of the projects and many are holding off and pausing until they see what the interest rate environment levels valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 out at from the cautious standpoint were not seeing as much certainly ci companies are managing their inventory tighter than they had been but were not seeing the same level of cautiousness steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thank you very much ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks operator one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi just a few followups i think most of my questions have been answered but just back on the margin are you bigger picture you guys optimistic on the margin beyond the third quarter is it returning to normal it feels that way but i thought id ask it travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah i think one of the interesting things is is how we look at the margin you go back over a twoyear period the volatility in our margin has been about a number versus about for the peers so i think in an inverted curve which are cyclical these things happen for us indiscernible margin compression i dont anticipate operating in an inverted curve for the rest of my career indiscernible rest of the management team does either so the margin will ultimately rebound and come back up to a more normalized level and when that happens i think the franchise value of the organization is going to increase dramatically were opening up more accounts today than weve ever opened before when amazing individual vertical business lines that we werent in before and the balance sheets obviously shifted three four five years ago of its balance sheet was in residential mortgages you look at the concentration that we have in ci today and the diversification even within the cre portfolio its a very different balance sheet and we believe that therell be definitely some benefit coming forward as the interest rate environment normalizes valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay so control what you can right travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay mike on slide theres a comment about the last bullet additional variable expense opportunities whats an example of that and whats the potential magnitude there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp sure its some of the usage things right that we have discretion over indiscernible that could be consulting costs it could be the additional usage of contracts because were going to go through a core conversion in the fourth quarter that might spill off and we might have some additional savings there as well but its also adding to knowledge having an organization that looks at cost and with a critical eye and tries to eliminate everything that we dont really need to do jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then i guess the last one on the allowance did you guys change your qualitative thinking at all in terms of your reserve levels im just curious a gut check on do you expect a worsening economy do you feel like a ph worsening economy is already inflected in your reserves just give me some thoughts on that thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp you know ill start off here this is mike and then our chief credit officer is here as well so ill have him fill in where i get this wrong but i think the first thing to note on this is we did migrate the ratings on moodys so thats the first thing to kind of take into account and we went to a slightly higher percentage more on the baseline and we reduced s4 which is that more severe recessionary why did we do that as moodys refines their estimates each quarter the baselines started to capture more of the if you will negative both gdp and unemployment numbers and so weve always been conservative in our ratings i think relative to our peers on this but as weve taken a look at their numbers it became pretty apparent that the baseline would capture more of that so we did make that change which has some bearing on allowance in the cecl model and then ill turn over to mark mark saeger a executive vice president chief credit officer valley national bancorp right this is mark saeger yeah mike thats absolutely accurate we had been holding at the ph on the and on the two downside scenarios based off of a continued migration to a slightly more valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 27jul2023 negative conservative outlook on moodys baseline we did back that off that being said that was not a material change in the overall weighting because our movement of the was offset by the more negative outlook on the baseline so we view that as modest we did not impose any additional qualitative overlays on the alll for this quarter as we did not see any material weaknesses in portfolio that warranted qualitative adjustments upwards where we are looking at performance of portfolio in the future to see if that that may be necessary but the performance of portfolio continues to be exceptionally strong and does not warrant any qualitative overlays jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay interesting comment on the baseline being almost approaching us for so thats a good comment so thanks guys appreciate it michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thanks jon operator that concludes the questionandanswer session at this time i would like to turn it back to ira robbins for closing remarks ira d robbins chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp just want to
