robbins ira d robbins president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp thank you rick good morning and welcome our fourth quarter results are a reflection of the tremendous progress weve achieved over the past couple of years we continue to make significant strides towards delivering on and repeating our previously stated goals of consistent growth improved operating efficiency and greater diversification of revenue in the fourth quarter of valley reported adjusted earnings per share of our adjusted eps was up from the fourth quarter of last year furthermore our full year adjusted eps of was also up versus the full year of keep in mind we delivered these results in a challenging macroeconomic environment which has put pressure on net interest margins for the entire industry equally impressive we delivered tangible book value growth for the full year while announcing and closing a significant acquisition additionally this growth occurred while paying a meaningful cash dividend and reinvesting in our products people and infrastructure two years ago we identified several key targets and guidelines for you to hold us accountable as you have observed substantial progress has been made on each and every one of those guidelines and targets our loan growth has consistently been above industry average while maintaining the same prudent underwriting standards which have long been a hallmark of valley we have driven down our core cost beating our estimated adjusted efficiency ratio goes for the full year of our multiyear branch transformation initiative has resulted in consolidations and cost saves while delivering a better product to our customers which can be seen in many underlying deposit trends and just as important that is customer experience scores throughout our branch network have exponentially expanded as well our fee income continues to grow boosted by improvement of existing businesses and expansion of new products lastly shareholder value creation is a top priority and we delivered an exceptional deal with oritani which was immediately accretive to tangible book value and all of our capital ratios additionally we remain very encouraged with the many trends we witnessed during the fourth quarter such as strong organic loan growth with significant geographic and product diversification excellent business and retail core deposit growth continued improvement in efficiency and very sound credit metrics im extremely proud of the progress we have made over the past two years and believe this is only the beginning of a long run of success for valley now id like to turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some additional financial highlights for the quarter michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide in quarterly net interest income and margin trends our net interest margin increased basis points to from the prior quarter while the interest rate spread increased basis points from the previous period we are encouraged by this linked quarter expansion given the remaining repricing valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 tailwind we believe exists in our current liability structure we had previously outlined this opportunity in our forward repricing gap during the third quarter call accordingly we have been focused on managing liability costs lower while maintaining competitively in the market furthering our efforts to lower the cost of funds was the extinguishment of approximately million of longer term fhlb debt during the fourth quarter we had originally cited the intention to extinguish this debt in conjunction with the closing of the oritani transaction this action resulted in an approximate million aftertax charge and is expected to result in approximately basis points of annual interest expense savings on a comparable level of borrowings a significant portion of which we have captured in recent weeks while we continue to place emphasis on the short end of the curve on liabilities we did take the opportunity to extend duration modestly during the fourth quarter by moving approximately million out between two and threeyear durations utilizing alternative wholesale funds we believe this action is prudent given the absolute rate available and current shape of the curve as you can see from the 12month forward maturity schedule on slide of our eps presentation there are still substantial ability to reprice both retail cds and other wholesale borrowings meaningfully lower should the current rate outlook remain as illustrated on slide we continue to see the effects of lower repricing on our monthly deposit rate averages as such we believe we are defensively positioned for the current rate environment and outlook moving to assets as expected the current environment continues to negatively impact portfolio yields that said we sold approximately million of mostly new york citybased multifamily loans that had a weighted average yield of approximately which helped offset some of the core yield compression at yearend approximately of our loans were adjustable rate while of total loans are scheduled to reset within the next months approximately of total loans are indexed to one month libor and another are tied to prime which repriced either daily or monthly additionally almost of loans priced off of varying cmt indices the bulk of which contractually reprice every five years as seen on the left chart on slide lower index rates over the past six plus months continued to place downward pressure on new loan origination yields while much of this is driven by market pressures we did witness a basis point rebound in new origination spreads during the quarter this is important and a product of our ability to access lower cost deposits to fund significant growth another noteworthy observation is the pace of lower new origination yields has begun to slow in recent months and while its too early to call a bottom stabilization is an encouraging signal moving on our noninterest income declined linked quarter driven primarily by lower swap fees of million as we discussed during the third quarter earnings call we expected that this business to soften in the fourth quarter moving forward we expect this could continue to be negatively impacted in the first quarter by what is historically a seasonally slower period for loan growth as a percentage of adjusted operating revenue adjusted fee income was which is a decline from the prior quarter level while this quarters outcome was modestly below our longterm goals of to of total operating revenue the quarterly annualized increase in net interest income compounded the declining fee ratio which is a good issue to have valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 diving into the results in more detail we generated swap volume of approximately million during the fourth quarter of originated backtoback swaps on approximately million of notional loans our net residential mortgage gain on sale income increased from the third quarter of these gains were the result of approximately million in loan sales during the quarter which consisted of both conforming flow and one jumbo bulk transaction our conforming gain on sale margins improved approximately basis points from the previous quarter in the future we believe more active marketing efforts and education among our sales team and clients will continue to make noninterest income a larger contributor to the bottom line our reported expenses increased approximately million from the prior quarter the reported numbers includes several infrequent items totaling approximately million on a pretax basis specifically the loss on extinguishment of fhlb debt was approximately million and mergerrelated expenses were million the amortization of tax credit investments was million for the fourth quarter our adjusted expenses exclusive of tax credit amortization and previously mentioned infrequent items were million up approximately million from the previous quarter importantly this does include one full month of direct oritani expenses which were approximately million approximately million of this can be seen in the quarterly salary lines with the balance being dispersed across several line items we also incurred approximately in quarterly expense aimed at resolution of oritanis preexisting regulatory issues its worth pointing out that the direct oritani expenses we realized in december would equate to achieving over cost saves on an annual basis well ahead of our expected timeline keep in mind these saves have occurred before a system and back office integration and without consolidating or closing a single branch further support of our commitment to efficiencies can be seen within the salary and employee benefits expense after adjusting for mergerrelated severance costs and backing out direct oritanirelated expenses from december we saw a decline of approximately million from third quarter this fourth quarter adjusted level equates to a quarterly yearoveryear decline of as compared to as we have spoken about many times in the past we are hyperfocused on creating greater operating leverage nowhere is that more obvious than looking at our adjusted efficiency ratio for the fourth quarter we reported million over sorry over a basis point decline versus the previous quarter while full year declined an impressive basis points from ending at this was well below our full year target of making this even more impressive is that this occurred while entering new markets expanding products and announcing and closing a significant acquisition it has become ingrained in our management culture to focus on reallocating resources towards business lines products and people that give us the greatest returns on our expense base and the results speak for themselves our loan growth adjusted for the acquisition of oritani for the fourth quarter was an annualized negative importantly this metric includes the sale of approximately million and multifamily commercial real estate loans mostly within new york city which occurred late in the fourth quarter absent the sale and the oritani acquisition loan growth would have been annualized our full year organic loan growth excluding valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 oritani and the sale of multifamily loans would have been approximately or just over the high end of our guidance as illustrated on slide much of this quarters organic growth came in commercial real estate ci and construction the average size cre loan originated during the quarter remains relatively small at million while average ci was just further diversifying our risk from a geographic perspective our growth was well distributed approximately of our total quarterly commercial growth came from florida and alabama while new york and new jersey made up approximately with the balance coming in our national commercial businesses we sold approximately million in residential loans during the quarter approximately of which came in the form of a jumbo portfolio bulk sale in which we retained servicing conforming loans sold increased from the previous quarter which generated the balance of gains via sales through our standard gse outlet deposit trends were very favorable for the quarter at quarter end loantodeposit ratio was well within our desired range our total deposits exoritani increased approximately linked quarter and for the full year excluding oritani noninterest bearing deposits grew annualized on a linked quarter basis while our core branch deposits grew for the full year we witnessed annualized linked quarter growth in savings now and money market accounts of also exclusive of the merger momentum in our branch and online deposit channels continues showing net new account growth of annualized on a linked quarter basis perhaps more important balances associated with these channels grew at a linked quarter annualized pace of over diving deeper we have seen tremendous balance sheet growth balanced growth in our checking accounts at on an annualized linked quarter basis our efforts in online banking while still relatively immature saw net account growth of from the previous quarter while all of our geographies experienced net account expansion as well we are proud of these achievements especially considering we closed branches during the calendar year that carried combined balances of approximately million this is further evidence that our branch transformation efforts led to more proactive customer outreach combined with enhanced product offerings are having a positive impact on both retention and growth as illustrated in the average deposit balance and rate trends chart on slide we have been managing deposit rates lower across both business and retail segments as shown the monthly average rates for savings now and money market accounts have declined for five of the past six months while cds have experienced a similar trend as we stated last quarter we expected greater repricing benefits to come in given the anticipated lag effects notably the months of november and december experienced accelerated declines in average rate we continue to expect more declines during the first quarter of given the forward repricing dynamic and liability sensitive pricing gap we face over the shortterm during the quarter we saw reliance on shortterm borrowings diminished by approximately million this was facilitated by a combination of pay downs offsetting the aforementioned loan sales accessing brokerage cds and valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 our successful core deposit raising efforts during the quarter as we mentioned earlier we extinguished approximately million of longterm fhlb debt during the quarter that we had previously identified if you recall this debt carried a weighted average cost of around compared to current market rates that are greater than basis points less that are greater than basis points less in the fourth quarter we added million of modest duration broker deposits at favorable longterm funding rates taking advantage of the shape and absolute level of the curve while we continue to place emphasis on pulling liability costs lower this is a prudent approach towards laddering our funding sources and managing our relatively neutral interest rate position i want to give a brief update on asset quality capital and the expected impacts of cecl our total nonperforming assets declined approximately million from the previous quarter our accruing past due loans saw a more meaningful drop from the previous quarter declining over million as we signaled in the previous quarter this decline was expected given the administrative circumstances that resulted in the previous quarters increase during the fourth quarter of we recorded a million provision for loan losses our net chargeoffs increased by from the previous quarter driven primarily by medallion loans for which reserves had previously have been established and one smaller ci credit turning to cecl we are lowering our estimated range of impact that we spoke about last quarter after running additional parallel tests and updating the expectations of the forecasted economic conditions and portfolio balances as of december we estimate that cecl could result in an increase to our nonpci allowance of approximately million to million as compared to our current reserve levels this is down from the previously expected range of million to million this addition would be exclusive of the balance sheet transfer that occurs within the pcirelated portion that existed at year end the pcirelated reclassification will not have any impact on the pro forma capital or regulatory phase in period in terms of capital youll notice the significant improvement in both tangible common equity and regulatory capital ratios during the quarter these increases were accomplished by a combination of the acquisition of acquired oritani capital and significant progress made towards lowering the risk weights associated with much of the acquired portfolio further the decline in risk weights was the furthering the decline in risk weights was the sale of approximately million in multifamily loans the robust levels of capital generated by the acquisition and other internal efforts are another example of managements commitment to building a balance sheet that can support values expansion for years to come id like to give a brief update on the increase in reserves associated with uncertain tax liability related to renewable energy tax credit and other tax benefits previously recognized from the investments in the dc solar funds plus interest as you may recall we had previously established a partial reserve in the first quarter of after recent developments we recorded an additional million increase in our tax reserve and as a result are fully reserved for the tax position related to dc solar at december finally moving to slide of our presentation to cover some targets and outlook we are establishing new full year loan growth guidance in the range of to after residential loan sales this growth assumes a base of approximately billion of our period end loan balance valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 our outlook for net interest income is being established in a range of to16 growth for the year this is the expected percentage growth off of our fullyear base of approximately million keep in mind this percentage growth is elevated due to the timing of the oritani acquisition and the expected fullyear realized net interest income from the acquired portfolio in addition to organic growth on a standalone valley the expected growth would be approximately to our net interest income outlook assumes a 25basispoint rate cut in in terms of net interest margin cadence it would be reasonable to assume some modest pressures in the first quarter of driven in part by seasonal decline due to day count combined with continued pressures on new origination asset yields and one full quarter impact of oritani we are maintaining our previous adjusted efficiency ratio target of or lower being achieved at a period during the year finally were establishing a fullyear tax rate range of to now ill turn the call back over to ira for some additional commentary ira d robbins president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp thanks mike id like to provide a brief update on the oritani merger after receiving regulatory approval and record time for valley we were very pleased to close the transaction in early december we look forward to the many benefits this transaction will provide including new customers deeper penetration into valuable affluent market and additional capital to fuel future growth we are planning integration later in the first quarter and should begin to deliver on additional cost saves shortly thereafter i am extremely happy with the progress made todate and want to thank all valley and former oritani employees that made this deal so special and successful in closing was an important year for valley many of the themes that weve laid out to you for the past two years are progressing and the financial results and momentum are illustrative of these efforts we had been able to deliver on significant goals we laid out which include sustainable balance sheet growth that is underwritten with our consistent and conservative approach greater efficiency positive operating leverage driven by a cultural shift within the entire organization thirdly strategic balance sheet management with a focus on building capital and allocating it more effectively and lastly a disciplined acquisition strategy aimed at creating shareholder value in the short and long term all of this has occurred while making significant reinvestment in our infrastructure to support a reinvigorated valley for years to come the banks transformation continues and i remain absolutely confident and energized by the progress made so far i believe these changes would have a positive impact on shareholder returns over the long term while reinforcing our commitment to community employees and innovation with that id like to now turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions we have a question from ken zerbe with morgan stanley your line is now open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great okay thanks good morning guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp good morning ken a good morning ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess maybe just starting off in terms of the loan sale this quarter i just want to make sure i got all the pieces here specifically the question is what was the gain that you made on that sale and the reason i ask is because if you look at sort of we know that the loans were yielding around youre saving so thats maybe basis points per year about million of savings but it costs you million to get out of this debt so there must be some very large gain to make this economically make sense for you guys thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey ken its tom iadanza i cant comment on the terms of the loan sale all i will tell you is that we believe it was prudent to exit or lower our exposure in the new york city multifamily portfolio there were no credit issues within this portfolio of loans we saw it actually was performing fairly well with a loantovalue and a times debt service coverage similar to the loans we have they dont they didnt fit into our relationship banking return and deposit strategy that we have within the bank theyre capitalintensive with lower relative yield with minimal crosssell and deposit opportunity and well always assess our capital leads and our asset businesses to make sure that they all fit or will seek better opportunities so again i just want to stress there were no cap there were no credit issues with it it was a sound portfolio it was an opportunity to get out of loweryielding assets in a class that we thought it was prudent to reduce ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp and ken this is ira ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 yeah ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp i think in our mind theyre really two separate transactions the fhlb transaction that we described when it came to prepaying the debt was consistent with what we disclosed when we were announcing the oritani transaction so basically what we did is we took a little bit of the excess capital that was generated through the oritani deal use that to pay down debt that took a prepayment charge so we still had a positive capital position that resulted from oritani and this created positive eps as we began to move forward so the loan sale really was a distinct decision differentiated from the gain or differentiated from what we did on the borrowings so i really wouldnt look at them as connected at all ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got even though you used a fair chunk of the proceeds from the sale to fund the fhlb repayment ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp we were looking at them from an independent perspective right ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp so when we announced the oritani transaction we announced the million so the saves that was going to come from that was largely a function of just reinvesting or reborrowing back in different term debt at a lower rate it so happened that we were able to as tom identified enter into this unique transaction that they coincided in the same quarter that said they really were an independent transaction and in our mind once again the fhlb transaction that we did on the borrowings was largely connected with what we were doing from the oritani deal and really utilizing some of that excess capital ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got you okay so assuming there is no gain which is my assumption or we can make that assumption this could have been net negative from you guys in day one but youre just saying you want to do it because strategically it makes you a better bank going forward even if youve lost money on this transaction ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp so i dont think over the longterm ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc is that valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp i dont think over the longterm we lost money on the transaction i think when you look at and make whole payments when it comes to any fhlb transaction you pretty much come up neutral i mean its all really a time value of money what your forecasted saves are versus what your onetime prepayment indiscernible is i think for us as we looked at it what was the additional capital that we acquired through the oritani transaction how much of that additional capital we needed versus where we wanted to be on an eps perspective on a prospective basis it was really just the balance of those two once again separately we entered into a unique transaction that provided us an opportunity as tom mentioned to reduce some of our exposure to the new york city marketplace and we were able to really move forward with that in addition to reducing some of that exposure i think as tom alluded to those were really transactions that didnt provide us opportunity to crosssell from a relationship perspective so we think its a much more efficient use of capital on a goforward basis ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i see okay that helps and maybe my second question if i may though what was the paa adjustment during the quarter and how much of that add to nim and nii thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so the this is mike so the total credit related mark was million of which roughly half of that is the credit interest portion of it and that has an average life of about four years ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry i meant the piece that actually flowed through nii in the quarter ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp i think what were giving is thats one thing weve tried not to really do ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i see ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp with regard to many transactions so we might give you a number of million broken out over a fouryear period so you can back into a number for what the one month would have look like and its really an immaterial number for us i think as we try to look at forward earnings we try to make them as sustainable as possible and not have a lot of purchase accounting adjustments within valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler your line is now open frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies hey good morning guys just on the loan growth assumptions for just wondering what that to might include in terms of runoff of the multifamily portfolio thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp hey frank its tom again i think the multifamily portfolio the new york piece is now stands at about billion pretty strong loan to value ph are in that kind of ph to range depending on the oritani versus a legacy valley portfolio the valley portfolio is all customer relationshipdriven so were not anticipating significant runoff well selectively participate and do new business there keep in mind this was not a major part of our business in the past the yields were always low we only did these loans to people we knew well longtime customers that were really indiscernible relationship driven so there could be an expectation that we will see some repayment through the normal course of business maybe a little bit extra but i think with what weve built in other aspects of our business well make up for that keep in mind mike mentioned the granular nature of the portfolio at million of average cre loan million on a ci side of a new production well thats our focus our focus is to be welldiversified without any reliance on any significant asset class so were going to continue that approach and we expect to meet the to guidance frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies im sorry how much tom do you say is new york multifamily with the oritani book thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp billion million is legacy valley about a little over million is oritani and again the loanto value on the valley piece is around on the oritani piece is all has performed and we expect that to continue ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp i think if you look at as a guide we originated about billion in total loans across the entire footprint and in each of the individual products i think for us as we continue to move forward theres absolutely not a focus on expanding the multifamily portfolio so balances are expected to really remain pretty much flat so i think as we commented on where we saw growth this year within the florida and alabama footprint to a larger degree than maybe some of the other areas as well as within that ci products that is probably going to continue for next year for us valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay just as a followup then the sale in the quarter if you could maybe just talk through why that bucket was a bit different in terms of ph because you sound like credit quality was still fine there what made given the pickup in capital from oritani and then you mentioned cecl also is a smaller relative mark why you decided to sell this bucket as opposed to let it runoff over time or get replaced over time so what was different between this and the rest of the portfolio thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah this bucket was a transaction oriented bucket of loans there was no deposit associated with it our loan todeposit ratio was quite high in this piece the balance of our portfolio is relationship driven its the people that we have longterm relationships that use us for many products and services so again it was really assessing our capital allocation getting out of lower yielding nonrelationship businesses and focusing our attention on the return and relationshipdriven businesses its return against volume frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then im sorry you might have said but this was not part of oritanis portfolio this multifamily sold thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp it was not part of oritani portfolio frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp its a valley portfolio frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies great okay thank you thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp thanks frank operator our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 hi good morning this is alex lau on for steve so post your the closing of oritani can you give an update on branch consolidations and also an update on underperforming branches thanks thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure alex its tom iadanza again we have identified and announced that there are nine branches all in less than a mile from each other that will be closed as part of the acquisition thats what were announcing and thats where we are today with regards to the valley branches and our branch transformation we had a previous calls announced we would be reducing the valley footprint by branches during were still on target for that i think on the positive side the retention of deposits in the closed branches has been very high and its really the based on us getting out in front of the customers getting to them early and making sure that we have a lot of contact and retain a high percentage of those deposits and if i recall theyre in an retention or so range well continue to manage it that way we do manage our branches individually that just to make sure that we have the right mix of deposits the right mix of people the right service levels our focus on our branches today are really service and saleoriented and its important to us we did complete the renovation and the new model look of our first date branches and im speaking as a proud father on this they came out extremely well and its been wellreceived by our customer base so were on track and on the way with our branch transformation alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for that and just a followup on your loantodeposit ratio with oritani what is the can you remind me the range that youre comfortable with and would that be below michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so as weve said in the past the same range on the top still exists so were looking for something in the neighborhood of to so its the same as it was before alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator our next question comes from david chiaverini with wedbush securities your line is now open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a couple questions for you so starting off looking on slide where it shows the loan yield portfolio and the origination yield so the origination yields were the overall portfolio is i was curious and i heard your comment about how the nim in the first quarter should be under some modest pressure but im curious if we think longer term given the roughly 40basispoint spread between what youre originating loans at and what the overall portfolio yield is at should we expect additional pressure kind of through valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so absent the comments we made about the first quarter which i think you have right keep in mind that our spread as i said in my prepared remarks was up basis points and so i think were seeing some slowing in the rate of decline here as i said its not indiscernible called bottom yet on it but its certainly encouraging maybe that those two lines in the bottom left quadrant of the slide would start to narrow somewhat david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay great thanks for that and then on the other side of the equation now that you prepaid the expensive fhlb debt and that some of your costs of deposits are coming down do you happen to have what the kind of blended spot rate cost of deposits or cost of funds i should say total cost of funds at december was that way it can give us an indication as to what to expect into the first quarter michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp were going to look david i dont think we have that handy but i can certainly reach out to you afterwards with that david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then last one related to that is and i like this slide where youre showing the cumulative cash flow gap and you show that the maturing cd rates are in the range what are you guys renewing cds at currently michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so ill answer that in two parts first one of the things that management tracks very well here is the retention of those cds as well and so those have ranged from roughly to for new rollover retained cds were in the range of to so very significant reduction in our funding costs on this large portfolio which you can see we have about billion first quarter another billion coming up in the second quarter and then another billion in the third quarter so it is a significant mover of our potential net interest margin as we talked about in the third quarter as well david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much operator operator instructions our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw your line is now open collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone just to continue on with the nim question so i just want to make sure i understood you all correctly you are assuming a fed cut in this guidance is that correct valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just trying to understand it seems like if we look at your nii guidance for the year and then some of the moving parts obviously to get there it just seems like the nim should trend in a much better way than what the nii guidance would imply so if there is opportunity to beat on the upside i mean where do you think you have a better opportunity on the funding side on the asset side because i just it just seems like if and i havent run through all the numbers but it seems like youre setting up for nii growth to be higher than what youre offering in a targeted range i want to try to figure out what i might be missing here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so i would put it into two buckets which i think you actually said first would be our funding costs the reason that we could not maybe achieve the net interest margin numbers that you might otherwise think are a function of whether or not the curve stays where it is today whether we have a fed rate cut or not the absolute shape of the curve and then how much we get so as ive said in the third quarter were going to reprice down on the cd and wholesale funding books the question is how much were going to fund down and were going to ladder into that were not going to try to reach some bottom and then pick the right time to do that the second part would be on the earning asset side of the loan book and to the extent that we would have loan growth higher than what were guiding to clearly we would have an increase in net interest margin collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp i think collyn when you look at it i think you obviously highlighted the two key points there but i think when you look at it we have an unbelievable amount of deposits as well as other types of funding thats going to reprice based on where the cost is today versus where were seeing overall market rates and then on the asset side obviously theres a significant amount of assets that are tied to shortterm indexes so if there was a rate move right off the bat theres an immediate negative reaction to our nim that said over the longer period of time it is absolutely accretive to us as we continue to move forward hope that helps collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then mike just to clarify your comment was that one quarter nim would be down is that what youre insinuating michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp valley

i think your point is right a few years ago we used to show a little bit of all in the fourth quarter based on the activity in the different types of instruments we were in so i think were running

guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp thanks tom thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp thanks operator and we have a followup question from david chiaverini with wedbush securities your line is now open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for taking the followup so i wanted to touch on expenses so previously youve given in absolute dollar kind of expense range for the next quarter possibly two quarters i was wondering if you had any thoughts as to what a normalized kind of expense run rate looking out to the first quarter would be michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp this is mike so obviously were not going to give guidance on a expense increase yearoveryear you can kind of back end to it given our efficiency ratio but i will say this that we demonstrated operating leverage in we want to continue that operating leverage and given the guidance that we laid out im pretty sure when you put that into your model youre going to see that operating leverage continue and just david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp to give you some idea that was about in david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript  earnings call 30jan2020 okay thanks for that and then question on other income is it was higher than expected the past couple quarters at million in the third quarter million in the fourth quarter just curious what to kind of expect in this line item going forward i think you mentioned earlier that there might be a little bit of some seasonal weakness in the first quarter but is lowteen kind of a good run rate there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i want to make sure i direct you to the right slide here here we go so if you take a look at slide you can see the components of that and the largest portion is the bottom which is that kind of dark blue which is the swap income and as we said in the third quarter we feel that the sheer level of swaps that were done was elevated came down a little bit in the fourth quarter like we said so i just think that in order for this to move meaningfully its probably going to come out of that category and its been averaging about million to million a quarter david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks very much michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes operator and at this time
