are fundamental to understanding managements discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations in preparing the consolidated financial statements management has made estimates judgments and assumptions in accordance with these policies that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated statements of financial condition and results of operations for the periods indicated at march we identified our policies on the allowance for credit losses goodwill and other intangible assets and income taxes to be critical accounting policies because management has to make subjective andor complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and because it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions management has reviewed the application of these policies and estimates with the audit committee of valleys board our critical accounting policies and estimates are described in detail in part ii item in valleys annual report and there have been no material changes in such policies and estimates since the date of such report new authoritative accounting guidance see note to the consolidated financial statements for a description of new authoritative accounting guidance including the dates of adoption and effects on results of operations and financial condition executive summary company overview a t march valley had consolidated total assets of approximately billion total net loans of billion total deposits of billion and total shareholders equity of billion valley operates many convenient branch office locations and commercial banking offices in northern and central new jersey the new york city boroughs of manhattan brooklyn and queens long island westchester county new york florida california alabama and illinois of our current branch network percent percent and percent of the branches are located in new jersey new york and florida respectively with the remaining percent of the branches in alabama california and illinois combined in february we completed the sale of our commercial premium finance lending business including million of our premium finance loan portfolio the transaction generated a pretax million net gain on sale of assets for the first quarter valley continues to hold certain commercial premium finance loans totaling million at march which are expected to mostly runoff at their scheduled maturity dates over the next months financial condition the combination of an inverted yield curve a high level of competition and economic uncertainty among other factors continued to weigh on the banking industry during the first quarter in the face of these challenges we have positioned our balance sheet to best mitigate these negative factors while focused on longer term earnings performance the following items are key highlights at march total assets was billion at march and remained relatively unchanged from december our liquid assets totaled billion at march representing percent of interest earning assets as compared with billion or percent of interest earning assets at december we continue to maintain significant access to readily available diverse funding sources to fulfill both shortterm and longterm funding needs see the bank liquidity section for additional information total deposits decreased million to billion at march as compared to billion at december due to contractual runoff of higher cost government banking time deposits combined with a million decrease in noninterest bearing deposits which was largely offset by solid growth in direct interest bearing deposits across several delivery channels see the deposits and other borrowings section for more details capital remained strong with ratios of both valley and the bank exceeding all capital adequacy requirements at march total shareholders equity increased million to billion at march as compared to december see the capital adequacy section for additional details total loans decreased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march from december largely due to the sale of million of commercial real estate and construction loans through loan participation agreements at par value in march and the sale of million of commercial and industrial loans associated with the sale of our premium finance lending division in february during the first quarter we also transferred million of construction loans to loans held for sale at march organic loan volumes in most categories remained at modest levels during the first quarter due to the ongoing impact of elevated market interest rates and other factors see further details on our loan activities under the loan portfolio section below asset quality continued to reflect our disciplined underwriting and lending practices during the first quarter nonperforming assets npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent at both march and december total net loan chargeoffs to average loans was percent for the first quarter as compared with percent for the fourth quarter see the nonperforming assets section for additional information total investment securities were billion or percent of total assets at march and remained relatively unchanged from december see the investment securities portfolio section for more details quarterly results net income for the first quarter was million or per diluted common share as compared to million or per diluted common share for the first quarter the million decrease in quarterly net income as compared to the same quarter one year ago was mainly due to the following changes a million decrease in net interest income as higher yields on both new loan originations and adjustablerate loans were more than offset by an increase in the cost of deposits a million increase in our provision for credit losses largely due to additional quantitative reserves allocated to our commercial loan portfolio and an million increase in noninterest expense partly due to estimated expenses related to the fdic special assessment of million which were partially offset by a million increase i n noninterest income that was primarily driven by higher brokerage and tax credit investment advisory fees within wealth management and trust fees net gains on sales of assets and service charges on deposit accounts partially offset by lower capital markets income and a million decrease in income tax expense mostly due to lower pretax income and additional tax credits in the first quarter see the net interest income noninterest income noninterest expense and income taxes sections below for more details on the impact of the items above and other infrequent noncore items impacting our first quarter results us economic conditions during the first quarter real gross domestic product gdp increased at an annual rate of percent as compared to an increase of percent during the fourth quarter the decrease in real gdp growth was primarily due to a decline in net exports slower government spending and a decline in nonresidential fixed investments inflation slightly picked up to percent in the first quarter as compared to percent for the fourth quarter and was largely attributed to price increases at the beginning of the year the federal funds upper target rate of percent remained unchanged since fourth quarter on may federal reserve officials noted that readings of inflation have come in above expectations but its unlikely that the next policy rate move will be a rate hike currently many market participants believe that a potential federal reserve rate cut is not likely until their december meeting if at all during due to the weak growth in gdp reported for the first quarter and persistently high inflation the 10year us treasury note yield ended the first quarter at percent or basis points higher as compared to the fourth quarter and the 2year us treasury note yield ended the first quarter at percent or basis points higher as compared to the fourth quarter us commercial banks commercial and industrial loans moderately declined from december to march overall commercial real estate lending continued to be closely monitored throughout the industry particularly among regional and midsize banks with sizeable exposures to office space as loan collateral some bright spots included an appetite for selective deals and lending in the first quarter and interest in grocery stores data centers and renewable energy plants properties regional banks continue to focus on the allin return on their banking relationships often requiring significant deposit accounts or ancillary business in order for them to join or remain in a lending relationship additionally the combination of high interest rates and tight inventories have kept residential real estate sales and both refinanced and purchased residential mortgage loan activity low during the first quarter although federal reserve efforts to combat inflation are showing signs of success several factors including but not limited to elevated inflation new and proposed bank regulatory actions the inverted yield curve elevated interest rates and geopolitical conflicts have added a higher level of uncertainty to the future path of the us economy and created a challenging bank operating environment should these conditions persist or further deteriorate they may adversely impact our financial results as highlighted in this mda deposits and other borrowings total average deposits decreased by million to billion for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter due to decreases of billion and million in average time and noninterest bearing deposits respectively partially offset by a million increase in average savings now and money market deposits the decrease in average time deposits was primarily due to our intentional runoff of both higher cost indirect customers ie brokered and government banking time deposits which contractually matured over the last six months average noninterest bearing balances modestly declined as compared to the fourth quarter as some customers continue to closely manage balances and shift funds into other higheryielding alternatives the increase in savings now and money market deposits was mostly broadbased reflecting strong customer inflows from both our physical branch and online delivery channels as well as our specialized deposit businesses over the last six months average noninterestbearing deposits savings now and money ma rket deposits and time deposits represented approximately percent percent and percent of total deposits for the first quarter respectively as compared to percent percent and percent of total deposits for the fourth quarter respectively actual ending balances for deposits decreased million to billion at march from december due to decreases of million and million in time deposits and noninterest bearing deposits respectively largely offset by an increase of million in savings now and money market deposits the decrease in time deposits was primarily due to intentional runoff of higher cost government banking time deposits which had matured noninterest bearing balances declined during the first quarter though remained unchanged as a percentage of total deposits as some customers continue to closely manage balances and shift funds into other higheryielding alternatives the solid growth in savings now and money market deposits was mostly attributable to inflows from our specialty niche deposits traditional branch and online delivery channels noninterest bearing deposits savings now and money market deposits and time deposits represented approxima tely

uninsured cds at march march in thousands less than three months three to six months six to twelve months more than twelve months total total estimated uninsured deposits excluding collateralized government deposits and intercompany deposits ie deposits eliminated in consolidation totaled approximately billion or percent of total deposits at march as compared to billion or percent of total deposits at december while we maintained a diversified commercial and consumer deposit base at march deposit gathering initiatives and our current deposit base could remain challenged due to market competition attractive investment alternatives such as us treasury securities and other factors as a result we cannot guarantee that we will be able to maintain deposit levels at or near those reported at march management continuously monitors liquidity and all available funding sources including nondeposit borrowings discussed below see the liquidity and cash requirements section of this

borrowings fhlb advances securities sold under repurchase agreements federal funds purchased total average longterm borrowings fhlb advances subordinated debt junior subordinated debentures issued to

weighted in shortterm fhlb advances in our average mix of funding sources starting in the fourth quarter average longterm borrowings including junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts which are presented separately on the consolidated statements of financial condition moderately increased million as compared to the fourth quarter due to billion of new fhlb advances issued during early march the billion of new borrowings have a weighted average rate of percent and a weighted average remaining contractual term of years at march actual ending balances for shortterm borrowings decreased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to maturities and repayment of fhlb advances longterm borrowings increased million to billion at march as compared to billion at december due to the new fhlb advances issued in march nongaap financial measures the table below presents selected performance indicators their comparative nongaap measures and the nongaap efficiency ratio for the periods indicated valley believes that the nongaap financial measures provide useful supplemental information to both management and investors in understanding valleys underlying operational performance business and performance trends and may facilitate comparisons of our current and prior performance with the performance of others in the financial services industry management utilizes these measures for internal planning forecasting and analysis purposes management believes that valleys presentation and discussion of this supplemental information together with the accompanying reconciliations to the gaap financial measures also allows investors to view performance in a manner similar to management these nongaap financial measures should not be considered in

the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively the slight decrease as compared to the fourth quarter was mainly due to an increase in average shortterm borrowings and the higher level of interest rates across most interest bearing deposit products partially offset by higher loan yields a decline in average time deposit balances and one less day during the first quarter as a result of the higher cost of shortterm borrowings and deposits total interest expense increased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter interest income on a tax equivalent basis increased million to million for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter the increase was mostly due to higher yields on both new originations and adjustable rate loans in our loan portfolio as well as higher yields on investments partially offset by a decline in average interest bearing deposits with banks as we reduced overnight excess cash liquidity in the first quarter average interest earning assets increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a billion increase in average loan balances driven by organic loan growth in the commercial loan categories during most of partially offset by a billion decline in average interest bearing cash held overnight as our excess liquidity returned to more normalized levels in after being elevated in response to the bank failures in compared to the fourth quarter average interest earning assets increased by million during the first quarter the increase was mainly driven by increases of million and million in average loans and taxable investments respectively partially offset by a million decline in average overnight interest bearing cash balances as compared to the prior linked quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased billion to billion for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to increases of billion and million in average time deposits and longterm borrowings respectively partially offset by a decrease of billion in average shortterm borrowings the increase in average time deposits was largely due to increased usage of

compared to the fourth quarter average interest bearing liabilities increased by million for the first quarter mainly due to a billion increase in average shortterm borrowings the increase in

percent for the fourth quarter and the first quarter respectively the overall cost of average interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter primarily driven by the higher level of market interest rates on deposits and shortterm borrowings the yield on average interest earning assets also increased by basis points to percent on a linked quarter basis largely due to the increased yield of the loan portfolio the yield on average loans increased by basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the fourth quarter mostly due to the higher level of market interest rates on new originations and adjustable rate loans based upon our latest model estimates we anticipate net interest income growth in the range of zero to two percent for the full year ended december as compared to while we remain optimistic that our net interest income should continue to stabilize and grow during the remainder of as

loan portfolio at march is subject to movements in the market level of interest rates and forecasted prepayment speeds the weighted average life of the automobile loans portfolio which represented percent of total loans at march is relatively unaffected by movements in the market level of interest rates however the average life may be impacted by new loans as a result of the availability of credit within the automobile marketplace and consumer demand for purchasing new or used automobiles consumer banking also includes the wealth management and insurance services division comprised of trust asset management brokerage insurance and tax credit advisory services consumer bankings average interest earning assets increased million to billion for the three months ended march as compared to the same period of the increase was largely due to new residential mortgage loan volumes originated for investment rather than sale over the last 12month period and to a lesser extent an increase in average home equity loans income before income taxes generated by the consumer banking segment decreased thousand to million for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter and was mainly driven by a combination of a decrease in net interest income and higher internal transfer expense largely offset by an increase in noninterest income and lower provision for loan losses net interest income for this segment decreased million mainly due to higher funding costs driven by higher interest rates the noninterest income increased million mainly due to a higher volume of success fees and other related periodic fees generated by our tax credit advisory subsidiary as well as brokerage fees generated from certain private banking clients see further details in the noninterest income

further details in the allowance for credit losses section of this mda net interest margin on the consumer banking portfolio decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter mainly due to a basis point increase in the costs associated with our funding sou rces partially offset by a basis point increase in the yield on average loa ns the increase in our funding costs was mainly driven by higher interest rates on most of our interest bearing deposit products as well as the mix of our adjustable rate and other borrowings during the first quarter the

transfer expense and a decrease in net interest income the declines were modestly offset by a million gain due to the sale of our commercial premium finance lending business in february the provision for credit losses increased million to million as compared to the same period in due in part to higher quantitative reserves mainly within the nonowner occupied commercial real estate loan category and increased specific reserves for collateral dependent nonperforming commercial loans see details in the allowance for credit losses for loans section of this mda net interest income for this

and corporate other to the consumer banking and commercial banking segments interest expense and internal transfer expense for general corporate expenses are allocated to each operating segment utilizing a transfer pricing methodology which involves the allocation of operating and funding costs based on each segments respective mix of average interest earning assets andor liabilities outstanding for the period other items disclosed in treasury and corporate other include net gains and losses on afs and htm securities transactions interest expense related to subordinated notes amortization of tax credit investments as well as other noncore items including merger restructuring expenses and fdic special assessment charges treasury and corporate others average interest earning assets decreased billion to billion for the three months ended march primarily due to a billion decline in average interest bearing cash held overnight as our excess liquidity returned to more normalized levels in after being elevated in response to the bank failures in most of for the three months ended march loss before income taxes totaled million compared to million for the same period in the million increase in the pretax loss during the first quarter was mainly driven by a decrease in net interest income on interest bearing deposits with banks combined with higher noninterest expense noninterest expense increased million to million during the three months ended march as compared to the same period in largely due to a million increase in the fdic insurance assessment expense in the first quarter the negative impact of these items was partially offset by lower provision for credit losses and higher internal transfer income provision for credit losses decreased million mostly due to credit related impairment of one corporate bond issued by signature bank during the first quarter the internal transfer income increased million to million for the three months ended march as compared to the same period in due to higher allocations of the overhead expense to the consumer banking and commercial banking segments over the same period see further details in the noninterest income and noninterest expense sections of this mda treasury and corporate others net interest margin decreased basis points to percent for the first quarter as compared to the first quarter due to a basis point increase in cost of our funding sources partly offset by an basis point increase in the yield on average investments the increase in the yield on average investments as compared to the same period a year ago was largely driven by new higher yielding investments and a reduction in premium amortization expense mostly caused by slower principal repayments in the elevated market interest rate environment assetliability management interest rate risk our success is largely dependent upon our ability to manage interest rate risk interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities to the movement in interest rates our assetliability management committee is responsible for managing such risks and establishing policies that monitor and coordinate our sources and uses of funds assetliability management is a continuous process due to the constant change in interest rate risk factors in assessing the appropriate interest rate risk levels for us management weighs the potential benefit of each risk management activity within the desired parameters of liquidity capital levels and managements tolerance for exposure to income fluctuations many of the actions undertaken by management utilize fair value analysis and attempt to achieve consistent accounting and economic benefits for financial assets and their related funding sources we have predominantly focused on managing our interest rate risk by attempting to match the inherent risk and cash flows of financial assets and liabilities specifically management employs multiple risk management activities such as optimizing the level of new residential mortgage originations retained in our mortgage portfolio through increasing or decreasing loan sales in the secondary market product pricing levels the desired maturity levels for new originations the composition levels of both our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as several other risk management activities we use a simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates the simulation model projects net interest income based on various interest rate scenarios over a 12month period the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities the model incorporates certain assumptions which management believes to be reasonable regarding the impact of changing interest rates and the prepayment assumptions of certain assets and liabilities as of march the model assumes immediate changes in interest rates without any proactive change in the composition or size of the balance sheet or other future actions that management might undertake to mitigate this risk in the model the forecasted shape of the yield curve remains static as of march the impact of interest rate derivatives such as interest rate swaps is also included in the model our simulation model is based on market interest rates and prepayment speeds prevalent in the market as of march although the size of valleys balance sheet is forecasted to remain static as of march in our model the composition is adjusted to reflect new interest earning assets and funding originations coupled with rate spreads utilizing our actual originations during the first quarter the model utilizes an immediate parallel shift in market interest rates at march the assumptions used in the net interest income simulation are inherently uncertain actual results may differ significantly from those presented in the table below due to the frequency and timing of changes in interest rates and changes in spreads between maturity and repricing categories overall our net interest income is affected by changes in interest rates and cash flows from our loan and investment portfolios we actively manage these cash flows in conjunction with our liability mix duration and interest rates to optimize the net interest income while structuring the balance sheet in response to actual or potential changes in interest rates additionally our net interest income is impacted by the level of competition within our marketplace competition can negatively impact the level of interest rates attainable on loans and increase the cost of deposits which may result in downward pressure on our net interest margin in future periods other factors including but not limited to the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows will impact our net interest income results and may increase or decrease the level of asset sensitivity of our balance sheet convexity is a measure of how the duration of a financial instrument changes as market interest rates change potential movements in the convexity of bonds held in our investment portfolio as well as the duration of the loan portfolio may have a positive or negative impact on our net interest income in varying interest rate environments as a result the increase or decrease in forecasted net interest income may not have a linear relationship to the results reflected in the table below management cannot provide any assurance about the actual effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income the following table reflects managements expectations of the change in our net interest income over the next month period considering the aforementioned assumptions while an instantaneous and severe shift in interest rates was used in this simulation model we believe that any actual shift in interest rates would likely be more gradual and would therefore have a more modest impact than shown in the table below estimated change in future net interest income changes in interest rates dollar change percentage change in basis points in thousands as noted in the table above a basis point immediate decrease in interest rates combined with a static balance sheet where the size mix and proportions of assets and liabilities remain unchanged is projected to decrease net interest income over the next 12month period by percent management believes the interest rate sensitivity of our balance sheet remains within a n expected t olerance range at march however the level of net interest income sensitivity may increase or decrease in the future as a result of several factors including potential changes in our balance sheet strategies the slope of the yield curve and projected cash flows liquidity and cash requirements bank liquidity liquidity measures valleys ability to satisfy its current and future cash flow needs our objective is to have liquidity available to fulfill loan demands repay deposits and other liabilities and execute balance sheet strategies in all market conditions while adhering to internal controls and income targets valleys liquidity program is managed by the treasury department and routinely monitored by the asset and liability management committee and two board committees among other actions the treasury department actively monitors valleys current liquidity profile sources and stability of funding availability of assets for pledging or sale opportunities to gather additional funds and anticipated future funding needs including the level of unfunded commitments the bank adheres to certain internal liquidity measures including ratios of loans to deposits below percent and wholesale funding to total funding below percent as summarized in the table below management maintains flexibility to temporarily exceed these thresholds in certain operating environments the following table presents valleys loan to deposits and wholesale funding to total funding ratios at march and december march december loans to deposits wholesale funding to total funding valleys short and longterm cash requirements include contractual obligations under borrowings deposits payments related to leases capital expenditures and other purchase commitments in the ordinary course of operations the bank also enters into various financial obligations including contractual obligations that may require future cash payments management believes the bank has the ability to generate and obtain adequate amounts of cash to meet its shortterm and longterm obligations as they come due by utilizing various cash resources described below on the asset side of the balance sheet the bank has numerous sources of liquid funds in the form of cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks including the frb of new york and other sources the following table summarizes valleys sources of liquid assets march december in thousands cash and due from banks interest bearing deposits with banks trading debt securities held to maturity debt securities

cost basis has been repaid within the held to maturity debt security portfolio includes a pproximately billion and million of various investment securities that were pledged to counterparties to support our earning asset funding strategies at march and december respectively total liquid assets represented percent and percent of interest earning assets at march and december respectively other sources of funds on the asset side are derived from scheduled loan payments of principal and interest as well as prepayments received at march estimated cash inflows from total loans are projected to be approximately billion over the next 12month period as a contingency plan for any liquidity constraints liquidity could also be derived from the sale of conforming residential mortgages from our loan portfolio or alleviated from the temporary curtail ment of lending activities we anticipate the receipt of approx imately million in principal payments from securities in the total investment portfolio at march over the next 12month period due to normally scheduled principal repayments and expected prepayments of certain securities primarily residential mortgagebacked securities on the liability side of the balance sheet we utilize multiple sources of funds to meet liquidity needs including retail and commercial deposits fully fdicinsured indirect customer deposits collateralized municipal deposits and shortterm and longterm borrowings our core deposit base which generally excludes all fully insured indirect customer deposits as well as retail certificates of deposit over thousand represents the largest of these source s average core deposits totaled approximately billion and billion for the three months ended march and for the year ended december respectively representing percent and percent of average interest earning assets for the respective periods the level of interest bearing deposits is affected by interest rates offered which is often influenced by our need for funds rates prevailing in the capital markets competition and the need to manage interest rate risk sensitivity in addition to customer deposits the bank has access to readily available borrowing sources to supplement its current and projected funding needs the following table presents shortterm borrowings outstanding at march and december march december in thousands fhlb advances

subordinated notes and junior subordinated debentures issued to capital trusts as part of our ongoing assetliability management strategies valley could also use cash to repurchase shares of its outstanding common stock under its share repurchase program or redeem its callable junior subordinated debentures and subordinated notes valleys cash needs are routinely satisfied by dividends collected from the bank projected cash flows from the bank are expected to be adequate to pay preferred and common dividends if declared and interest expense payable to subordinated note holders and capital trusts given the current capital levels and current profitable operations of the bank in addition to dividends received from the bank valley can satisfy its cash requirements by utilizing its own cash and potential new funds borrowed from outside sources or capital issuances valley also has the right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures and therefore distributions on its trust preferred securities for consecutive quarterly periods of up to five years but not beyond the stated maturity dates and subject to other conditions investment securities portfolio as of march we had million billion and billion in equity afs debt and htm debt securities respectively we also had million of trading securities consisting of us treasury securities at march the afs and htm debt securities portfolios which comprise the majority of the securities we own include us treasury securities us government agency securities taxexempt and taxable issuances of states and political subdivisions residential mortgagebacked securities singleissuer trust preferred securities principally issued by bank holding companies and high quality corporate bonds among other securities our afs debt securities include securities such as bank issued and other corporate bonds as well as municipal special revenue bonds which may pose a higher risk of future impairment charges to us as a result of the uncertain economic environment and its potential negative effect on the future performance of the security issuers the equity securities consist of two publicly traded mutual funds cra investments and several other equity investments we have made in companies that develop new financial technologies and in partnerships that invest in such companies our cra and other equity investments are a mix of both publicly traded entities and privately held entities the primary purpose of the htm and afs debt securities portfolios is to provide a source of earnings and liquidity as well as serve as a tool for managing interest rate risk the decision to purchase or sell securities is based upon the current assessment of long and shortterm economic and financial conditions including the interest rate environment and other components of statement of financial condition see additional information under interest rate sensitivity liquidity and cash requirements and capital adequacy sections elsewhere in this mda we continually evaluate our investment securities portfolio in response to established assetliability management objectives changing market conditions that could affect profitability and the level of interest rate risk to which we are exposed these evaluations may cause us to change the level of funds we deploy into investment securities change the composition of our investment securities portfolio and change the proportion of investments primarily made into the afs and htm debt securities portfolios allowance for credit losses and impairment analysis available for sale debt securities afs debt securities in unrealized loss positions are evaluated for impairment related to credit losses at least quarterly in assessing whether a credit loss exists we compare the present value of cash flows expected to be collected from the security with the amortized cost basis of the security if the present value of cash flows expected to be collected is less than the amortized cost basis for the security a credit loss exists and an allowance for credit losses is recorded limited to the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis declines in fair value that have not been recorded through an allowance for credit losses such as declines due to changes in market interest rates are recorded through other comprehensive income net of applicable taxes we have evaluated all afs debt securities that are in an unrealized loss position as of march and december and determined that the declines in fair value were mainly attributable to changes in market v olatility due to factors such as interest rates and spread factors but not attributable to credit quality or other factors during the first quarter valley recognized a credit related impairment of one corporate bond issued by signature bank resulting in both a provision for credit losses and full chargeoff of the security totaling million based on a comparison of the present value of expected cash flows to the amortized cost the bond was subsequently sold and the sale resulted in a thousand gain during the fourth quarter there was no other impairment recognized within the afs debt securities portfolio during the three months ended march and march valley does not intend to sell any of its afs debt securities in an unrealized loss position prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis and it is more likely than not that valley will not be required to sell any of its securities prior to recovery of our amortized cost basis none

assumptions used in the model for pools of securities with common risk characteristics include the historical lifetime probability of default and severity of loss in the event of default with the

performed by third parties of each security as of the date presented and not necessarily the investment grades at the date of our purchase of the securities for many securities the rating agencies may not have performed an independent analysis of the tranches owned by us but rather an analysis of the entire investment pool for this and other reasons we believe the assigned investment grades may not accurately reflect the actual credit quality of each security and should not be viewed in isolation as a measure of the quality of our investment portfolio the following table presents the available

unearned discount and deferred loan fees of million and million at march and december respectively total loans decreased million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march from december largely as a result of the sale of million of commercial real estate and construction loans at par value to bank leumi leisrael bm blita and the sale of million of commercial and industrial loans associated with the sale of our premium finance lending division during the first quarter during the three months ended march we also transferred million of construction loans to loans held for sale at march and subsequently sold the loans at par value to blita in april loans held for sale are presented separately from total loans on the consolidated statements of financial condition totaled million and million at march and december respectively commercial and industrial loans decreased million to billion at march from december mostly due to the sale of the million of loans associated with the sale of our premium finance lending division in february and the contractual runoff of premium finance loans that were retained and not sold our retained commercial premium finance portfolio totaled million at march and is expected to mostly runoff at their scheduled maturity dates over the next months commercial real estate loans excluding construction loans decreased million to billion at march from december largely due to the sale of million through loan participation agreements with blita during march we continue to be selective in the organic loan originations mainly to existing and other wellestablished clients within our markets of florida new jersey new york and manhattan the commercial real estate loan portfolio had a combined weighted average loan to value ratio of percent and debt service coverage ratio of at march commercial real estate collateralized by office buildings totaled approximately billion at march and remained relatively unchanged as compared to december our loans collateralized by office buildings had a combined weighted average loan to value rate of percent and debt service coverage ratio of at march construction loans decreased million to billion at march from december partly due to the sale of million of loan participations with blita in march and the transfer of million of loans to loans held for sale as of march the remaining net decrease largely relates to the migration of completed projects to both internal and external permanent financing and a low level of new advances on existing projects residential mortgage loans totaled billion at march and increased million from december primarily due to the continued retention of a high percentage of new loan volumes for investment rather than for sale combined with lower prepayment activity during the first quarter new and refinanced residential mortgage loan originations totaled million for the first quarter as compared to million and million for the fourth quarter and first quarter respectively during the first quarter we retained approximately percent of the total residential mortgage originations in our held for investment loan portfolio the volume of primarily new home loan applications remained relatively low in the early stages of the second quarter largely due to the higher level of mortgage interest rates and this may continue to challenge our ability to grow this loan category home equity loans increased by only million to million at march compared to december as new home equity loan originations remained challenged due to the unfavorable high interest rate environment automobile loans increased by million or percent on an annualized basis to billion at march as compared to december mainly due to a slight uptick in application volume and slower repayments as compared to the fourth quarter other consumer loans decreased million to billion at march as compared to december as demand and utilization of collateralized personal lines of credit slowed during the first quarter a significant part of our lendin g is in northern and central new jersey new york city long island and florida to mitigate our geographic risks we make efforts to maintain a diversified portfolio as to type of borrower and loan to guard against a potential downward turn in any one economic sector looking forward to second quarter and beyond we expect to remain highly selective on new loan originations and generally supportive of compelling projects led by our high quality and tenured customer base we will continue to focus our new origination efforts on traditional commercial and industrial owneroccupied real estate and healthcare for the full year ended december we currently expect total loan growth in the range of zero to four percent as compared to total loans of billion at december nonperforming assets npas include nonaccrual loans oreo and other repossessed assets which primarily consist of automobiles and taxi medallions at march loans are generally placed on nonaccrual status when they become past due in excess of days as to payment of principal or interest exceptions to the nonaccrual policy may be permitted if the loan is sufficiently collateralized and in the process of collection oreo is acquired through foreclosure on loans secured by land or real estate oreo and other repossessed assets are reported at lower of cost or fair value less estimated cost to sell our npas decreased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to lower nonaccrual construction loan balances npas as a percentage of total loans and npas totaled percent at both march and december as shown in the table below we believe our total npas has remained low as a percentage of the total loan portfolio and the level of npas which is reflective of our consistent approach to the loan underwriting criteria for both valley originated loans and loans purchased from third parties for additional details see the credit quality indicators section in note to the consolidated financial statements our lending strategy is based on underwriting standards designed to maintain high credit quality and we remain optimistic regarding the overall future performance of our loan portfolio during the three months ended march most of our credit trends have remained relatively stable and the majority of our borrowers continued to demonstrate resilience despite the impact of higher borrowing costs elevated inflation labor costs and other factors we continue to proactively monitor our commercial loans for potential negative trendsborrower weakness due to the current operating environment and internally risk rate them accordingly however management cannot provide assurance that the nonperforming assets will not materially increase from the levels reported at march due to the aforementioned or other factors potentially impacting our lending customers the following table sets forth by loan category accruing past due and

million at march as compared to december due to declines in all loan categories except for commercial real estate which was largely comprised of two loans in this early stage delinquency category loans past due to days decreased million to million at march as compared to december largely due to lower delinquencies across the noncommercial real estate loan categories loans days or more past due and still accruing interest increased thousand to million at march as compared to december all the loans past due days or more and still accruing interest are wellsecured and in the process of collection nonaccrual loans decreased million to million at march as compared to million at december mainly due to lower nonaccrual construction loan balances nonaccrual construction loans decreased million to million at march as compared to december largely due to the partial loan chargeoffs related to two loan relationships during the first quarter nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans increased million to million at march as compared to december mainly due to one new nonperforming loan relationship totaling million which was largely offset by million of partial loan chargeoffs related to one taxi medallion loan relationship during the first quarter nonperforming taxi medallion loans included in nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans totaled million at march and had related reserves of million or percent of such loans within the allowance for loan losses as compared to million of loans with related reserves of million at december potential further declines in the market valuation of taxi medallions and the current operating environment mainly within new york city may negatively impact the performance of this portfolio although the timing of collection is uncertain management believes that the majority of the nonaccrual loans at march are well secured and largely collectible based in part on our quarterly review of collateral dependent loans and the valuation of the underlying collateral if applicable any estimated shortfall in each collateral valuation results in an allocation of specific reserves within our allowance for credit losses for loans allowance for credit losses for loans the acl for loans includes the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments under cecl our methodology to establish the allowance for loan losses has two basic components i a collective reserve component for estimated expected credit losses for pools of loans that share common risk characteristics and ii an individual reserve component for loans that do not share risk characteristics consisting of collateral dependent loans valley also maintains a separate allowance for unfunded credit commitments mainly consisting of undisbursed noncancellable lines of credit new loan commitments and commercial standby letters of credit valley estimates the collective acl using a current expected credit losses methodology which is based on relevant information about historical experience current conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the collectability of the loan balances in estimating the component of the allowance on a collective basis we use a transition matrix model which calculates an expected life of loan loss percentage for each loan pool by generating probability of default and loss given default metrics the metrics are based on the migration of loans within the commercial and industrial loan categories from performing to loss by credit quality rating or delinquency categories using historical lifeofloan analysis periods for each loan portfolio pool and the severity of loss based on the aggregate net lifetime losses the models expected losses based on loss history are adjusted for qualitative factors among other things these adjustments include and account for differences in i the impact of the reasonable and supportable economic forecast relative probability weightings and reversion period ii other asset specific risks to the extent that they do not exist in the historical loss information and iii net expected recoveries of chargedoff loan balances these adjustments are based on qualitative factors not reflected in the quantitative model but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses the expected lifetime loss rate is the life of loan loss percentage from the transition matrix model plus the impact of the adjustments for qualitative factors the expected credit losses are the product of multiplying the models expected lifetime loss rate by the exposure at default at period end on an undiscounted basis valley utilizes a twoyear reasonable and supportable forecast period followed by a oneyear period over which estimated losses revert to historical loss experience for the remaining life of the loan on a straightline basis the forecasts consist of a multiscenario economic forecast model to estimate future credit losses and are governed by a crossfunctional committee the committee meets each quarter to determine which economic scenarios developed by moodys will be incorporated into the model as well as the relative probability weightings of the selected scenarios based upon all readily available information the model projects economic variables under each scenario based on detailed statistical analyses we have identified and selected key variables that most closely correlated to our historical credit performance which include gdp unemployment and the caseshiller home price index at march valley maintained the majority of its probability weighting used in the economic forecast to the moodys baseline scenario with less emphasis on the s3 downside and s1 upside scenarios the probability weightings were unchanged from december at march the standalone moodys baseline scenario reflected a more optimistic outlook as compared at december in terms of most metrics highlighted below at march the moodys baseline forecast included the following specific assumptions gdp expansion of approximately percent in the second quarter unemployment of percent in the second quarter approximately to percent over the remainder of the forecast period ending in the first quarter inflation rate at percent in february and the federal reserve continuing to pause with the federal funds rate at percent and possible

increase was partially offset by lower economic forecast and other qualitative reserves at march and a credit ie negative provision for unfunded credit commitments our provision for credit losses could remain elevated during the remainder of due to several factors including but not limited to the impact of future changes in our economic outlook the overall performance of our loan portfolio and the composition of our loan portfolio capital adequacy a significant measure of the strength of a financial institution is its shareholders equity at both march and december shareholders equity
