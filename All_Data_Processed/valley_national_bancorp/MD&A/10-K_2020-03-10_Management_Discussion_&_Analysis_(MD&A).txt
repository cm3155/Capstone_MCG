legacy valley branches during february valley plans to close and consolidate three legacy valley branches into branches acquired from oritani during the second quarter we do not expect these branch closings to impact the timing of the planned closures discussed in the branch transformation section below branch transformation as previously disclosed valley has embarked on a strategy to overhaul its retail network approximately one year ago we established the foundation of what the transformation of our branch network would look like in coming years at that time we identified branches that did not meet certain internal performance measures including branches that were closed and consolidated by the end of the first quarter for the remaining branches we implemented tailored action plans focused on improving profitability and deposit levels as well as upgrades in staffing and training within a defined timeline at december the majority of the branches have seen measurable success in terms of relative cost of deposits deposit mix and overall balance growth however some locations have not met our established performance targets as such we currently expect to close approximately branches during table start valley has received no objection or adverse guidance from the frb or the occ regarding the current level of its quarterly common stock dividend valley maintains an effective shelf registration statement with the sec that allows us to periodically offer and sell in one or more offerings individually or in any combination our common stock preferred stock and other nonequity securities the shelf registration statement provides valley with capital raising flexibility and enables valley to promptly access the capital markets in order to pursue growth opportunities that may become available in the future and permits valley to comply with any changes in the regulatory environment that call for increased capital requirements valleys ability and any decision to issue and sell securities pursuant to the shelf registration statement is subject to market conditions and valleys capital needs at such time additional equity offerings may dilute the holdings of our existing shareholders or reduce the market price of our common stock or both such offerings may be necessary in the future due to several reasons beyond managements control including numerous external factors that could negatively impact the strength of the us economy or our ability to maintain or increase the level of our net income see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional
