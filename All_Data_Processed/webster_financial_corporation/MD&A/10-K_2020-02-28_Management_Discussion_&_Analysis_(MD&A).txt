real estate appraisal performed by independent licensed appraisers a licensed inhouse appraisal officer or qualified individual reviews these appraisals for compliance with the financial institutions reform recovery and enforcement act and the uniform standards of professional appraisal practice a fair value shortfall is recorded as an impairment reserve against the alll subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate should reliable information come to managements attention that the value has declined further additional impairment may be recorded to reflect the particular situation thereby increasing the alll any impaired loan for which no specific valuation allowance was necessary at december and december is the result of either sufficient cash flow or sufficient collateral coverage of the book balance at december there were impaired loans and leases with a recorded investment balance of million which included loans and leases of million with an impairment allowance of million compared to impaired loans and leases with a recorded investment balance of million which included loans and leases of million with an impairment allowance of million at december the reduction of million in impairment allowance reflects managements current assessment on the resolution of these credits based on collateral considerations guarantees or expected future cash flows of the impaired loans troubled debt restructurings a modified loan is considered a tdr when two conditions are met i the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and ii the modification constitutes a concession modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower the company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted including the debtors ability to access market rate funds in general a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms the most common types of modifications include covenant modifications forbearance andor other concessions if the buyer does not perform in accordance with the modified terms the loan is reevaluated to determine the most appropriate course of action which may include foreclosure loans for which the borrower has been discharged under chapter bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent tdrs and thus impaired at the date of discharge and charged down to the fair value of collateral less cost to sell the companys policy is to place each consumer loan tdr except those that were performing prior to tdr status on nonaccrual status for a minimum period of six months commercial tdrs are evaluated on a casebycase basis for determination of whether or not to place them on nonaccrual status loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months initially all tdrs are reported as impaired generally tdrs are classified as impaired loans and reported as tdr for the remaining life of the loan impaired and tdr classification may be removed if the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum of six months and through one fiscal yearend and the restructuring agreement specifies a market rate of interest equal to that which would be provided to a borrower with similar credit at the time of restructuring in the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from tdr classification it is the companys policy to continue to base its measure of loan impairment on

considered a critical accounting policy executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the alll reserve which is maintained on a quarterly basis at a level management deems sufficient to cover probable losses inherent within the loan and lease portfolios the process for estimating probable losses is based on predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan portfolio and combines the measurement with other quantitative and qualitative factors that together with an impairment reserve determines the overall reserve requirement management applies significant judgments and assumptions that influence the loss estimate and alll balance quantitative and qualitative considerations by management include factors such as the nature and volume of portfolio growth national and regional economic conditions and trends other internal performance metrics and assumptions as to how each of these factors is expected to impact near term loss trends while actual future conditions and losses realized may vary significantly from present judgments and assumptions management believes the alll is adequate as of december the companys methodology for assessing an appropriate level for the alll includes three key elements impaired loans and leases are analyzed either on an individual or pooled basis and assessed for a specific reserve which is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate of the loan or lease except that as a practical expedient impairment may be measured based on a loan or leases observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan or lease is collateral dependent a loan or lease is collateral dependent if the repayment of the loan or lease is expected to be provided solely by the underlying collateral management considers the pertinent facts and circumstances for each impaired loan or lease when selecting an appropriate method to measure impairment then reviews and evaluates each selection to ensure its continued appropriateness loans and leases that are not considered impaired and have similar risk characteristics are segmented into homogeneous pools and modeled using quantitative methods to determine a loss estimate loss estimates incorporate a loss emergence period lep model which represents the period of time between a loss event first occurring and the confirming event of its chargeoff a lep is determined for each loan type based on the companys historical performance experience and is reassessed at least annually commercial portfolios utilize an expected loss methodology that is based on probability of default pd and loss given default lgd models pd and lgd models generally are derived using the companys portfolio specific data over a defined look back period and are refreshed annually the pd and lgd models based on borrower and facility risk ratings assigned to each loan are updated throughout the year should the financial condition of a borrower change residential and consumer portfolios use roll rate models to estimate probable inherent losses the models calculate the roll rate at which loans migrate from one delinquency category to the next worse delinquency category and eventually to loss the roll rate models use the recent delinquency and loss experience based upon a specified look back period and are segmented based on product type and common risk characteristics the models also incorporate an estimated pay down factor by product type the roll rate calculations are performed quarterly and are done consistently from period to period the portfolio performance and assumptions utilized are regularly reviewed while the roll rate model is evaluated on an annual basis management also considers qualitative factors consistent with interagency regulatory guidance that are not explicitly factored in the quantitative models but that can have an incremental or regressive impact on losses incurred in the current loan and lease portfolio at december the alll was million compared to million at december the decrease of million in the reserve at december compared to december is primarily due to lower reserves on impaired loans in the residential and homeequity loan portfolios the alll reserve remains adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan and lease portfolios alll as

material adverse effect on the companys liquidity capital resources or operations in addition management is not aware of any regulatory recommendations regarding liquidity which if implemented would have a material adverse effect on the company offbalance sheet arrangements webster engages in a variety of financial transactions that in accordance with gaap are not recorded in the financial statements or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts such transactions are utilized in the normal course of business for general corporate purposes or for customer financing needs corporate purpose transactions are structured to manage credit interest rate and liquidity risks or to optimize capital customer transactions are structured to manage their funding requirements or facilitate certain trade arrangements these transactions give rise to in varying degrees elements of credit interest rate and liquidity risk for the year ended december webster did not engage in any offbalance sheet transactions that would have a material effect on its financial condition assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both short and longterm interest rate risks in determining management strategy and action to facilitate and manage this process interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by alco the primary goal of alco is to manage interest rate risk to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments subject to board approved risk limits the board sets policy limits for earnings at risk for parallel ramps in interest rates over twelve months of plus and minus and basis points as well as interest rate curve twist shocks of plus and minus and basis points economic value or equity at risk limits are set for parallel shocks in interest rates of plus and minus and basis points due to the federal funds rate target range set at as of december the declining interest rate scenarios of minus basis points or more for both earnings at risk and equity at risk were not run per alco policy instead scenarios were run with short and long term rates declining to zero but not below in alco implemented a balance sheet repositioning strategy with the goal of reducing asset sensitivity to falling rates which included the purchase of interest rate floors alco also regularly reviews earnings at risk scenarios for nonparallel changes in rates as well as longerterm scenarios of up to four years in the future management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate earnings and equity at risk these risk measures are quantified using simulation software key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads prepayment speeds and the runoff of deposits from such simulations interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented earnings at risk is defined as the change in earnings excluding provision for loan and lease losses and income tax expense due to changes in interest rates interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and earnings results are compared to a flat rate scenario as a base the flat rate scenario holds the end of the period yield curve constant over the twelve month forecast horizon earnings simulation analysis incorporates assumptions about balance sheet changes such as asset and liability growth and mix changes and loan and deposit pricing it is a measure of shortterm interest rate risk equity at risk is defined as the change in the net economic value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of existing assets liabilities and offbalance sheet contracts it is a measure of the longterm interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the current balance sheet asset sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value increasing compared to a base scenario when interest rates rise and decreasing when interest rates fall in other words assets are more sensitive to changing interest rates than liabilities and therefore reprice faster likewise liability sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value decreasing compared to a base scenario when interest rates rise and increasing when interest rates fall key assumptions underlying the present value of cash flows include the behavior of interest rates and spreads asset prepayment speeds and attrition rates on deposits cash flow projections from the model are compared to market expectations for similar collateral types and adjusted based on experience with webster banks own portfolio the models valuation results are compared to observable market prices for similar instruments whenever possible the behavior of deposit and loan customers is studied using historical time series analysis to model future customer behavior under varying interest rate environments the equity at risk simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitragefree trinomial lattice term structure model the base case rate scenario against which all others are compared uses the monthend liborswap yield curve as a starting point to derive forward rates for future months using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with forward rates as the mean in shock scenarios the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the base case cash flows for all instruments are generated using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date amortization type coupon rate repricing frequency and repricing date the assetliability simulation software is enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database instruments with explicit options such as caps floors puts and calls and implicit options such as prepayment and early withdrawal ability require such a rate and cash flow modeling approach to more accurately quantify value and risk on the asset side risk is impacted the most by mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors in the loan portfolio floors are a benefit to interest income in low rate environments floatingrate loans at floors pay a higher interest rate than a loan at a fully indexed rate without a floor as with a floor there is a limit on how low the interest rate can fall as market rates rise however the interest rate paid on these loans does not rise until the fully indexed rate rises through the contractual floor on the liability side there is a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have options to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time implicit floors on deposits based on historical data are modeled webster bank also has the option to change the interest rate paid on these deposits at any time websters earnings at risk model incorporates net interest income nii and noninterest income and expense items some of which vary with interest rates these items include mortgage banking income servicing rights cash management fees and derivative marktomarket adjustments four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits alco meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook the committees interest rate expectations the risk position and other factors alco delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and subcommittees but monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis various interest rate contracts including futures and options interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors can be used to manage interest rate risk these interest rate contracts involve to varying degrees credit risk and interest rate risk credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract the notional amount of interest rate contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments are based the notional amount is not exchanged and therefore should not be taken as a measure of credit risk refer to note derivative financial instruments in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for additional information certain derivative instruments primarily forward sales of mortgagebacked securities are utilized by webster bank in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage banking activities prior to closing and funds disbursement an interestrate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower during such time webster bank is subject to risk that market rates of interest may change impacting pricing on loan sales in an effort to mitigate this risk forward delivery sales commitments are established thereby setting the sales price the following table summarizes the estimated impact that gradual parallel changes in interest rates of and basis points over a twelve month period starting december and december might have on websters nii for the subsequent twelve month period compared to nii assuming no change in interest rates table

scenario as a base the flat rate scenario holds the end of period yield curve constant over a twelve month forecast horizon the flat rate scenario as of december and december assumed a federal funds rate of and respectively asset sensitivity for both nii and ppnr on december was lower as compared to december with the exception of the minus basis points nii scenario this lower asset sensitivity is primarily due to repositioning the balance sheet by adding fixedrate securities buying interest rate floors fixed rate loan growth and shortening the weighted average life of the time deposits portfolio to months as of december versus months as of december webster can also hold futures options and forward foreign currency contracts to minimize the price volatility of certain assets and liabilities changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in earnings the following table summarizes the estimated impact that immediate nonparallel changes in interest rates might

scenarios are modeled with the short end of the yield curve moving up or down and basis points while the long end of the yield curve remains unchanged and vice versa the short end of the yield curve is defined as terms of less than eighteen months and the long end as terms of greater than eighteen months these results above reflect the annualized impact of immediate rate changes sensitivity to increases in the short end of the yield curve for nii and ppnr decreased from december due primarily to balance sheet repositioning and an increase in balances of fixedrate loans nii and ppnr were more sensitive to changes in the long end of the yield curve as of december when compared to december due to increased forecast prepayment speeds resulting from decreases in the long end of the yield curve which shortens asset duration by increasing prepayments for mbs and residential mortgages the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of assets liabilities and offbalance sheet

estimated economic value change dollars in thousands bp bp at december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value at december assets liabilities net net change as base net economic value table end changes in economic value can be best described using duration duration is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments for small changes in interest rates for fixedrate instruments it can also be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows for floatingrate instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity for given changes in interest rates floatingrate instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates increases in interest rates typically reduce the value of fixedrate assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher discount rates a liabilitys value decreases for the same reason in a rising rate environment a reduction in value of a liability is a benefit to webster duration gap is the difference between the duration of assets and the duration of liabilities a duration gap near zero implies that the balance sheet is matched and would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for a small change in interest rates websters duration gap was negative years at december and negative years at december when measured using basis point changes in rates a negative duration gap implies that liabilities are longer than assets and therefore they have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates slower than assets consequently websters net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the longer term absent the effects of new business booked in the future as of december longterm rates have fallen by basis points when compared to december this lower starting point shortens asset duration by increasing residential loans and mbs prepayment speeds these estimates assume that management does not take any action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates the earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ management believes that websters interest rate risk position at december represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management as always is prepared to act in the event that interest rates do change rapidly impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and related data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap which generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation unlike most industrial companies substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature as a result interest rates have a more significant impact on websters performance than the effects of general levels of inflation interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services critical accounting policies and accounting estimates the companys significant accounting policies as described in the notes to consolidated financial statements are fundamental to understanding its results of operations and financial condition as stated in note to the consolidated financial statements contained in item of this report the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make judgments and accounting estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes while the company bases estimates on historical experience current information and other factors deemed to be relevant actual results could differ materially from those estimates accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and procedures and can be susceptible to significant change critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operation and that require management to make the most difficult subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain and which could potentially result in materially different amounts using different assumptions or under different conditions the two critical accounting policies identified by management which are discussed with the appropriate committees of the board of directors are summarized below allowance for loan and lease losses the alll is a reserve established through a provision for loan and lease losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of probable losses that are inherent within the companys portfolio of loans and leases as of the balance sheet date changes in the alll and therefore in the related provision for loan and lease losses can materially affect net income the level of the alll reflects managements judgment based on continuing evaluation of specific credit risks loss experience current portfolio quality present economic political adequacy of underlying collateral present value of expected future cash flows and regulatory conditions and inherent risks not captured in quantitative modeling and methodologies as well as trends therein the allowance balance may be allocated for specific portfolio segments however the entire allowance balance is available to absorb credit losses inherent in the total loan and lease portfolio while management utilizes its best judgment and information available the ultimate adequacy of the alll is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the companys control including performance of the companys loan portfolio the economy interest rate sensitivity and other external factors management evaluates the composition of the alll on a quarterly basis composition of the alll including valuation methodology is more fully described in note loans and leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report and in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section captioned allowance for loan and lease losses methodology realizability of deferred tax assets in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic income taxes certain aspects of accounting for income taxes require significant management judgment including assessing the realizability of dtas a dta represents an item for which a benefit may be recognized for financial accounting purposes if
