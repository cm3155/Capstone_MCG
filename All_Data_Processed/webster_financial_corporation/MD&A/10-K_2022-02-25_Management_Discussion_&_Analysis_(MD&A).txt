in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations covid19 update during the united states economy began to recover from the covid19 pandemic as the increased availability and distribution of covid19 vaccines allowed for the easing of restrictive measures that had previously been imposed by state and local governments despite these improvements certain adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic may continue to impact the macroeconomic environment for some time including labor shortages disruptions to global supply chains and rising inflationary pressures these effects are anticipated to continue throughout but remain uncertain and difficult to predict including any impact to websters business liquidity financial condition and results of operations in the federal reserve reduced interest rates to near zero in response to the effects of the covid19 pandemic however in response to inflationary pressures the frb has announced that it will begin to taper its purchase of mortgage and other bonds webster expects interest rates to gradually and slowly rise over the course of the next year but the timing and impact of the reversal in

management and investors with information useful in understanding websters financial position operating results the strength of its capital position and overall business performance these measures are used by management for internal planning and forecasting purposes as well as by securities analysts investors and other interested parties to assess peer company operating performance management believes this presentation together with the accompanying reconciliations provides a complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting the companys business and allows investors to view its performance in a similar manner tangible book value per common share represents shareholders equity less preferred stock and goodwill and other intangible assets divided by common shares outstanding at the end of the period the tangible common equity ratio represents shareholders equity less preferred stock goodwill and other intangible assets divided by total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets both of these measures are used by management to evaluate the strength of the companys capital position the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated using the companys net income available to common shareholders adjusted for the taxeffected amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of average shareholders equity less average preferred stock average goodwill and average other intangible assets this measure is used by management to assess websters performance against its peer financial institutions the efficiency ratio which represents the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue is calculated excluding certain nonoperational items in order to measure how the company is managing its recurring operating expenses these nongaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis financial measures because nongaap financial measures are not standardized it may not be possible to compare these with other companies that present financial measures having the same or similar names the following tables reconcile nongaap financial measures to the most comparable financial measures defined by gaap table

million and million respectively applicable to salt net operating loss and credit carryforwards that are available to offset future taxable income through the ultimate realization of those dtas is dependent on the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which the net operating loss and credit carryforwards are available in making its assessment management considers the companys forecasted future results of operations estimates the content and apportionment of its income by legal entity over the near term for salt purposes and also applies longerterm growth rate assumptions based on its estimates management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize its dtas net of the valuation allowance at december however it is possible that some or all of websters net operating loss carryforwards could expire unused or that more net operating loss carryforwards could be utilized than estimated either as a result of changes in future forecasted levels of taxable income for salt purposes due to the merger with sterling or if future economic or market conditions or interest rates were to vary significantly from the companys forecasts and in

to monitor credit risk commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of the borrowers management is a critical element of the underwriting process and credit decision once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay obligations as contracted commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal balance commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to those for commercial nonmortgage assetbased and equipment finance loans these loans are primarily viewed as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of commercial real estate loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria all transactions are appraised to validate market value commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the specific risk characteristics of the portfolio these policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized loan structures are spread across many different borrowers minimizing the level of credit risk trend and outlook reports are reviewed by

corporation fico score the loan amount relative to property value and the borrowers debttoincome level webster bank originates both qualified mortgage and nonqualified mortgage loans as defined by applicable cfpb rules loan modifications webster works with customers to modify loan agreements when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulty webster will modify a loan to minimize the risk of loss and achieve the best possible outcome for both the borrower and the company loan modifications can take various forms including payment deferral rate reduction covenant waiver term extension or other actions depending on the nature of the modification it may be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring tdr troubled debt restructurings a modified loan is considered a tdr when two conditions are met i the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and ii the modification constitutes a concession modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of each individual borrower webster considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted including the debtors ability to access market rate funds generally a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms common tdr modifications include changes in covenants pricing and forbearance loans in which the borrower has been discharged under chapter bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent tdrs and thus at the date of discharge are charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell covid19 payment modifications webster has accommodated over customers impacted by the covid19 pandemic through paymentrelated deferrals at december total outstanding loan balances related to these modifications in their deferral period were million this amount includes all loans associated with a customer relationship where at least one loan has been modified or is in the process of modification a significant portion of the covid19 payment modifications have not been considered a tdr based on their nature webster continues to actively monitor customer relationships associated with these modified loans the impact of these modifications is appropriately reflected in the acl on loans and leases the cares act and interagency statement in response to the covid19 pandemic financial institutions were provided relief from certain tdr accounting and disclosure requirements for qualifying loan modifications through the coronavirus aid relief and economic security act cares act specifically section of the cares act which was extended by the consolidated appropriations act provided temporary relief from certain gaap requirements for loan modifications related to covid19 in addition a group of banking regulatory agencies issued a revised interagency statement that offered practical expedients for evaluating whether covid19 loan modifications were tdrs at december total outstanding loan balances associated with loan modifications designated in connection with these tdr relief provisions in their deferral period were million these modifications generally represented payment deferrals ranging from three to six months in length the million decrease from million at december is the result of borrowers exiting their payment deferral period webster continues to evaluate the effectiveness of this loan modification program as deferral periods end allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases decreased million or from million at december to million at december primarily due to improvements in the forecasted economic outlook and favorable credit trends which were negatively affected by the emergence of the covid19 pandemic in and resulted in a release of reserves in partially offset by reserves on newly originated loans and leases the following table summarizes the percentage allocation of the acl across the loans and leases categories table start at december  in thousands amount amount commercial nonmortgage assetbased commercial real estate equipment financing residential home equity other consumer total acl on loans and leases table end the acl allocated to a single loan and lease category does not preclude its availability to absorb losses in other categories methodology websters acl on loans and leases is considered to be a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses that are expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the allowance which is maintained at a level that management deems to be sufficient to cover expected credit losses within the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model whereby an expected lifetime credit loss is recognized at the origination or purchase of an asset including those acquired through a business combination which is then reassessed at each reporting date over the contractual life of the asset the calculation of expected credit losses includes consideration of past events current conditions and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts generally expected credit losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics however if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches that of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses the total acl on loans and leases recorded by management represents the aggregated estimated credit loss determined through both the collective and individual assessments collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on product type credit quality risk ratings andor collateral types within its commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a probability of default pd loss given default lgd and exposure at default ead framework expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the expected exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio managements pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information and credit risk ratings websters models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a two year reasonable and supportable forecast period webster incorporates forecasts of macroeconomic variables in the determination of expected credit losses macroeconomic variables are selected for each class of financing receivable based on relevant factors such as asset type the correlation of the variables to credit losses among others data from a baseline forecast scenario of these variables is used as an input to the modeled loss calculation qualitative adjustments may be applied in relation to economic forecasts when relevant facts and circumstances are expected to impact credit losses particularly in times of significant volatility in economic activity after the reasonable and supportable forecast period the credit loss model gradually reverts to historical loss rates for the remaining life of the loans and leases on a straightline basis over a one year reversion period the calculation of ead follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of a similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses and principal paydowns the combination of contractual repayments and voluntary prepayments a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics that are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses individually assessed loans and leases if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change such that it no longer matches the risk characteristics of the collectively assessed pool it is removed from the population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans where the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed the measurement method used to calculate the expected credit loss on an individually assessed loan or lease is dependent on the type and whether the loan or lease is considered to be collateral dependent methods for collateral dependent loans are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated cost to sell when the basis of repayment is the sale of collateral or the present value of the expected cash flows from the operation of the collateral for noncollateral dependent loans either a discounted cash flow method or other loss factor method is used any individually assessed loan or lease for which no specific valuation allowance is deemed necessary is either the result of sufficient cash flows or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost of the asset additional information regarding websters acl methodology can be found within note summary of significant accounting policies in the

contained in part ii item financial statements and supplementary data assetliability management and market risk an effective assetliability process must balance the risks and rewards from both shortterm and longterm interest rate risks when determining managements strategy and action to facilitate this interest rate sensitivity is monitored on an ongoing basis by alco the primary goal of alco is to manage interest rate risk and to maximize net income and net economic value over time in changing interest rate environments subject to limits approved by the board of directors the board of directors sets policy limits for earnings at risk for parallel ramps in interest rates over twelve months of and basis points as well as interest rate curve twist shocks of and basis points limits for economic value or equity at risk are set for parallel shocks in interest rates of and basis points due to the federal funds rate target range being to at december and the declining interest rate scenarios for both earnings at risk and equity at risk of minus and basis points or more were not run per alcos policy instead scenarios were run with shortterm and longterm interest rates declining to zero but not below in alco implemented a balance sheet repositioning strategy with the goal of reducing asset sensitivity to falling interest rates which resulted in the purchase of interest rate floors alco also regularly reviews earnings at risk scenarios for nonparallel changes in interest rates as well as longterm scenarios of up to four years in the future management measures interest rate risk using simulation analysis to calculate websters earnings at risk and equity at risk these risk measures are quantified using simulation software key assumptions relate to the behavior of interest rates and spreads prepayment speeds and the runoff of deposits from such simulations interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented earnings at risk is defined as the change in earnings due to changes in interest rates excluding the provision for credit losses and income tax expense interest rates are assumed to change up or down in a parallel fashion and earnings results are compared to a flat rate scenario as a base which holds the period end yield curve constant over the twelve month forecast horizon at both december and the flat rate scenario assumed a federal funds rate of earnings simulation analysis incorporates assumptions about balance sheet changes such as product mix growth and loan and deposit pricing it is a measure of shortterm interest rate risk equity at risk is defined as the change in the net economic value of financial assets and financial liabilities due to changes in interest rates compared to a base net economic value equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of existing financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments it is a measure of the longterm interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the current balance sheet asset sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value increasing when interest rates rise and decreasing when interest rates fall as compared to a base scenario in other words financial assets are more sensitive to changing interest rates than liabilities and therefore reprice faster likewise liability sensitivity is defined as earnings or net economic value decreasing when interest rates rise and increasing when interest rates fall as compared to a base scenario key assumptions underlying the present value of cash flows include the behavior of interest rates and spreads asset prepayment speeds and attrition rates on deposits cash flow projections from the model are compared to market expectations for similar collateral types and adjusted based on experience with webster banks own portfolio the models valuation results are compared to observable market prices for similar instruments whenever possible the behavior of deposit and loan customers is studied using historical time series analysis to model future customer behavior under varying interest rate environments the equity at risk simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitragefree trinomial lattice term structure model the base case rate scenario against which all others are compared uses the monthend liborswap yield curve as a starting point to derive forward rates for future months using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with forward rates as the mean in shock scenarios the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the base case scenario cash flows for all financial instruments are generated using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date amortization type coupon rate repricing frequency and repricing date the assetliability simulation software is enhanced with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database financial instruments with explicit options such as caps floors puts calls and implicit options such as prepayment and early withdrawal abilities require such modeling approach to more accurately quantify value and risk on the asset side risk is impacted the most by residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors in the loan portfolio floors are a benefit to interest income in low interest rate environments floatingrate loans at floors pay a higher interest rate than a loan at a fully indexed rate without a floor as with a floor there is a limit on how low the interest rate can fall as market rates rise however the interest rate paid on these loans does not rise until the fully indexed rate rises through the contractual floor on the liability side there is a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have options to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time implicit floors on deposits based on historical data are modeled webster bank also has the option to change the interest rate paid on these deposits at any time websters earnings at risk model incorporates net interest income and noninterest income and expense items some of which vary with interest rates these items include mortgage banking income mortgage servicing rights cash management fees and derivative marktomarket adjustments four main tools are used for managing interest rate risk the size duration and credit risk of the investment portfolio the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of loans and deposits alco meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook the committees interest rate expectations the risk position and other factors alco delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and subcommittees but continuously monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis various interest rate contracts including futures options swaps caps and floors can be used to manage interest rate risk these contracts involve to varying degrees levels of credit and interest rate risk the notional amount of the derivative instrument or the amount from which interest and other payments are derived is not exchanged and therefore should not be used as a measure of credit risk in addition certain derivative instruments such as forward sales of mortgagebacked securities are used by webster bank to manage the risk of loss associated with its mortgage banking activities generally prior to closing and funds disbursement an interestrate lock commitment is extended to the borrower during this time webster bank is subject to the risk that market interest rates may change which could impact pricing on loan sales in an effort to mitigate this risk webster bank establishes forward delivery sales commitments thereby setting the sales price webster will also hold futures options and forward foreign currency

than eighteen months and the longend of the yield curve is defined as terms greater than eighteen months the results reflect the annualized impact of immediate interest rate changes sensitivity to the shortend of the yield curve for both net interest income and ppnr increased at december as compared to december primarily due to changes in deposit beta assumptions which were approved by alco and are reflective of managements current deposit strategy and balance sheet composition and excess cash held at the frb as interest rates rise this cash can be deployed into higher yielding financial assets net interest income and ppnr were less sensitive to changes in the longend of the yield curve at december as compared to december primarily due to slower forecasted prepayment speeds as a result of increases in the longend of the yieldcurve which in turn extends the duration for mortgagebacked securities and residential mortgage loans again due to the lower interest rate environment at both december and management did not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate assumptions to model the down rate scenarios that were previously modeled when market rates were higher the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of financial assets financial liabilities and offbalance sheet financial instruments and the corresponding estimated change in economic value if interest rates were to instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points at december and table start book value estimated economic value estimated economic value change dollars in thousands 100bp 100bp at

value can best be described through duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments due to changes in interest rates for fixedrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate financial instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset overall the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates generally increases in interest rates reduce the economic value of fixedrate financial assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher interest rates in a rising interest rate environment the economic value of financial liabilities decreases for the same reason a reduction in the economic value of financial liabilities is a benefit to webster floatingrate financial instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates duration gap represents the difference between the duration of financial assets and financial liabilities a duration gap at or near zero would imply that the balance sheet is matched and therefore would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for changes in interest rates at december and websters duration gap was negative years and negative years respectively a negative duration gap implies that the duration of financial liabilities is longer than duration of financial assets and therefore are more price sensitive and will reset their interest rates more slowly consequently websters net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of financial liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of financial assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and decrease when interest rates fall over the long term absent the effects of any new business booked in the future at december longterm rates have risen by basis points as compared to december this higher starting point extends financial asset duration by decreasing residential mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities prepayment speeds the aforementioned earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ and also assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates management believes that the companys interest rate risk position at december represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management is prepared to take additional action in the event that interest rates do change rapidly critical accounting estimates the preparation of websters consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes thereto in accordance with gaap and practices generally applicable to the financial services industry requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities while managements estimates are made based on historical experience available current information and other factors that are deemed to be relevant actual results could significantly differ from those estimates accounting estimates are necessary in the application of certain accounting policies and can be susceptible to significant change in the near term critical accounting accounting estimates are those estimates made in accordance with gaap that involve a significant level of estimation uncertainty and have had or are reasonably likely to have a material impact on websters financial condition or results of operations management has identified that websters most critical accounting estimate is its acl on loans and leases this critical accounting policy including its underlying estimates is discussed directly with the audit committee of the board of directors allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the acl on loans and leases is a reserve established through a provision for credit losses charged to expense which represents managements best estimate of expected lifetime credit losses within websters loan and lease portfolios at the balance sheet date the calculation of expected credit losses is determined using predictive methods and models that follow a pd and lgd framework and include consideration of past events current conditions macroeconomic variables such as unemployment gross domestic product retail sales and interest rate spreads and reasonable and supportable economic forecasts that affect the collectability of the reported amounts changes to the acl on loans and leases and therefore to the related provision for credit losses can materially affect financial results the determination of the appropriate level of acl on loans and leases inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires webster to make significant estimates of current credit risks and trends using existing qualitative and quantitative information and reasonable supportable forecasts of future economic conditions all of which may undergo frequent and material changes changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers and macroeconomic variables that webster is more susceptible to unforeseen events such as natural disasters and pandemics along with new information regarding existing loans identification of additional problems loans the fair value of underlying collateral and other factors both within and outside the companys control may indicate the need for an increase or decrease in the acl on loans and leases it is difficult to estimate the sensitivity of how potential changes in any one economic factor or input might affect the overall reserve because a wide variety of factors and inputs are considered in estimating the acl and changes in those factors and inputs considered may not occur at the same rate and may not be consistent across all product types further changes in factors and inputs may also be directionally inconsistent such that improvement in one factor may offset deterioration in others executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the acl on loans and leases on a quarterly basis although the overall balance is determined based on specific portfolio segments and individually assessed assets the entire balance is available to absorb credit losses for any of the loan and lease portfolios additional information regarding the determination of the acl on loans and leases including websters valuation methodology can be found in part ii under the section captioned allowance for credit losses contained elsewhere in item managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and within note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data
