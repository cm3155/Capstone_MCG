potential problem loans are generated using the companys loan reporting systems webster has implemented incremental monitoring procedures in connection with covid19 commercial and industrial loans are underwritten after evaluating and understanding the borrowers ability to operate and service its debt assessment of management is a critical element of the underwriting process and overall credit decision once it is determined that the borrowers management possesses sound ethics and a solid business acumen current and projected cash flows are examined to determine the ability of the borrower to repay its agreed upon obligations commercial and industrial loans are primarily made based on the identified cash flows of the borrower and secondarily on the underlying collateral provided by the borrower however the cash flows of borrowers may not be as expected and the collateral securing these loans may fluctuate in value most commercial and industrial loans are secured by the assets being financed and may incorporate personal guarantees of the principal amounts commercial real estate loans are subject to underwriting standards and processes similar to commercial and industrial loans these real estate loans are viewed primarily as cash flow loans and secondarily as loans secured by real estate repayment of these loans is largely dependent on the successful operation of the property securing the loan the market in which the property is located and the tenants of the property securing the loan the properties securing the companys commercial real estate portfolio are diverse in terms of type and geographic location which reduces the companys exposure to adverse economic events that may affect a particular market management monitors and evaluates commercial real estate loans based on collateral geography and risk grade criteria commercial real estate loans may be adversely affected by conditions in the real estate markets or in the general economy management periodically utilizes thirdparty experts to provide insight and guidance about economic conditions and trends affecting its commercial real estate loan portfolio consumer loans are subject to policies and procedures developed to manage the risk characteristics of the portfolio policies and procedures coupled with relatively small individual loan amounts and predominately collateralized structures

rules loan modifications webster works with customers to modify loan agreements when borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties webster will modify a loan in order to minimize the risk of loss and achieve the best possible outcome for both the borrower and the company loan modifications can take various forms and include payment deferrals rate reductions covenant waivers term extensions or other action depending on the nature of modification it may or may not be accounted for as a troubled debt restructuring tdr covid19 payment modification activities the company has accommodated over customers impacted by covid19 through paymentrelated deferrals as of march loan balances associated with these modifications in their deferral period totaled approximately million this balance includes all loans associated with a customer relationship where at least one loan has been modified or is in process of modification a significant portion of the loan balances associated with these modifications would not be considered a tdr based on the nature of the modification certain other modifications that would otherwise be considered a tdr are subject to tdr accounting relief through the cares act and interagency statement included in the million are the million of loan balances associated with the cares act and interagency statement as discussed below the company continues to actively monitor customer relationships associated with these modified loans the impact of these modifications is reflected in our allowance for credit losses on loans and leases the cares act and interagency statement in response to the covid19 pandemic financial institutions were provided relief from certain tdr accounting and disclosure requirements for qualifying loan modifications specifically section of the cares act extended by the consolidated appropriations act provided temporary relief from certain gaap requirements for modifications related to covid19 in addition a group of banking regulatory agencies issued a revised interagency statement that offers practical expedients for evaluating whether covid19 loan modifications are tdrs as of march loan balances associated with loan modifications designated in connection with these relief provisions in their deferral period totaled approximately million these modifications represent payment deferrals generally three to six months in length the million decrease from million at december is primarily the result of borrowers exiting their payment deferral period the company will continue to evaluate the effectiveness of the loan modification program as the deferral periods end for additional information on the accounting for loan modifications under section of the cares act and the interagency statement refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in websters form 10k troubled debt restructurings a modified loan is considered a tdr when two conditions are met i the borrower is experiencing financial difficulties and ii the modification constitutes a concession modified terms are dependent upon the financial position and needs of the individual borrower the company considers all aspects of the restructuring in determining whether a concession has been granted including the debtors ability to access market rate funds in general a concession exists when the modified terms of the loan are more attractive to the borrower than standard market terms common modifications include material changes in covenants pricing and forbearance loans for which the borrower has been discharged under chapter bankruptcy are considered collateral dependent tdrs and thus are impaired at the date of discharge and charged down to the fair value of collateral less costs to sell the companys policy is to place consumer loan tdrs on nonaccrual status for a minimum period of six months except for those that were performing prior to tdr status commercial tdrs are evaluated on a casebycase basis for determination of accrual status loans qualify for return to accrual status once they have demonstrated performance with the restructured terms of the loan agreement for a minimum of six months generally a tdr is classified and reported as a tdr for the remaining life of the loan tdr classification may be removed if the loan was restructured under market conditions and the borrower demonstrates compliance with the modified terms for a minimum period of six months in the limited circumstance that a loan is removed from tdr classification it is the companys policy to continue to base its measure of credit loss on the contractual terms specified by the loan agreement the following tables provide information for loans classified as tdrs three months ended march in thousands

leveraging established risk tolerance levels through its underwriting standards servicing and portfolio management of loans and leases loans and leases particularly where a heightened risk of loss has been identified are regularly monitored to mitigate further deterioration that could potentially impact key measures of asset quality in future periods management considers past due loans and leases nonperforming assets and credit loss levels to be key measures of asset quality the following table provides key asset quality ratios at march at december nonperforming loans and leases as a

leases to net chargeoffs calculated for the march period based on annualized yeartodate net chargeoffs these ratio calculations include the impact of ppp loans totaling billion for which there was no allowance for credit losses recorded at both march and december potential problem loans and leases potential problem loans and leases are defined by management as certain loans and leases that for the commercial portfolio are performing loans and leases classified as substandard and have a welldefined weakness that could jeopardize the full repayment of the debt and the consumer portfolio are performing loans that are accruing income and are days past due potential problem loans and leases exclude loans and leases that are accruing income and are past due days or more nonaccrual loans and leases and tdrs certain loans with modifications related to covid19 are not reflected as potential problem loans and have not reported as tdrs due to relief provisions of the cares act and interagency statement as discussed elsewhere in section as uncertainties related to the pandemic still exist there is a risk that some of these modified loans may become potential problem loans at a later date management monitors potential problem loans and leases due to a higher degree of risk associated with those loans and leases the current expectation of lifetime losses is included in the acl on loans and leases however management cannot predict whether these potential problem loans and leases ultimately will become nonperforming or result in a loss the company had potential problem loans and leases of million at march as compared to million at december allowance for credit losses on loans and leases methodology the companys policy for acl on loans and leases is considered a critical accounting policy the acl on loans and leases is a contraasset account that offsets the amortized cost basis of loans and leases for the credit losses expected to occur over the life of the asset executive management reviews and advises on the adequacy of the reserve which is maintained at a level management deems sufficient to cover expected losses within each of the loan and lease portfolios the acl on loans and leases is determined using the cecl model which requires recognition of expected lifetime credit losses at the purchase or origination of an asset expected losses are determined through a pooled collective assessment of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics if the risk characteristics of a loan or lease change and no longer match that of the collective assessment pool it is removed and individually assessed for credit impairment management applies significant judgments and assumptions that influence the loss estimate and acl on loan and lease balances collectively assessed loans and leases collectively assessed loans and leases are segmented based on the commercial and consumer portfolios and expected losses are determined using a probability of defaultloss given defaultexposure at default pdlgdead framework expected credit losses are calculated as the product of the probability of a loan defaulting expected loss given the occurrence of a default and the current exposure of a loan at default summing the product across loans over their lives yields the lifetime expected credit losses for a given portfolio the companys pd and lgd calculations are predictive models that measure the current risk profile of the loan pools using forecasts of future macroeconomic conditions historical loss information and credit risk ratings the companys models incorporate a single economic forecast scenario and macroeconomic assumptions over a reasonable and supportable forecast period macroeconomic variables are selected based on the correlation of the variables to credit losses for each class of financing receivable data from the baseline forecast scenario is used as the input to the model loss calculation after the reasonable and supportable forecast period the company reverts to historical loss rates for the remaining life of the loans and leases on a straightline basis over a oneyear reversion period the calculation of exposure at default follows an iterative process to determine the expected remaining principal balance of a loan based on historical paydown rates for loans of similar segment within the same portfolio the calculation of portfolio exposure in future quarters incorporates expected losses and principal paydown ppd ppd is the combination of contractual repayment and prepayment a portion of the collective acl is comprised of qualitative adjustments for risk characteristics which are not reflected or captured in the quantitative models but are likely to impact the measurement of estimated credit losses individually assessed loans and leases when loans and leases no longer match the risk characteristics of the collective assessment pool they are removed from the collectively assessed population and individually assessed for credit losses generally all nonaccrual loans tdrs potential tdrs loans with a chargeoff and collateral dependent loans when the borrower is experiencing financial difficulty are individually assessed individual assessment calculations are either based on the fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell the present value of the expected cash flows from operation of the collateral discounted cash flows or other individual assessment approach as appropriate a fair value shortfall relative to the amortized cost balance is reflected as an impairment reserve within the acl on loans and leases subsequent to an appraisal or other fair value estimate should reliable information come to managements attention that the value has declined further additional impairment may be recorded to reflect the particular situation thereby increasing the acl on loans and leases any individually assessed loan for which no specific valuation allowance was necessary is the result of either sufficient cash flow or sufficient collateral coverage relative to the amortized cost if the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance is reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit loss the acl on loans and leases represents the total of estimated losses calculated through collective and individual assessments to assist management with its review reports related to loan production loan quality concentrations of credit loan delinquencies nonperforming loans and potential problem loans are generated using the companys loan reporting systems while actual future conditions and losses realized may vary significantly from present judgments and assumptions management believes the acl on loans and leases is adequate as of march for additional information on the companys acl methodology refer to note to the consolidated financial statements included in websters form 10k allowance for credit losses on loans and leases balances and ratios the acl on loans and leases decreased million or from million at december to million at march the decrease in the allowance is attributed to improvements in the forecasted economic outlook and favorable credit trends as compared to that at the start of the covid19 pandemic the acl on loans and leases as a percentage of total loans and leases also known as the reserve coverage ratio decreased from at december to at march the acl on loans and leases as a percentage of nonperforming loans and leases increased from at december to at march the following table provides

increased to approximately billion as of march lowering overall asset sensitivity but is being offset by increased cash levels at the frb due to elevated deposits when interest rates start to rise not all of these loans will immediately lift off of their floors due to the lower rate environment as of both march and december management does not run standard scenarios with negative interest rate

annualized impact of immediate rate changes sensitivity to the short end of the yield curve for both nii and ppnr increased as of march as compared to december due to excess cash at the frb as rates rise this cash can be deployed into higher yielding assets nii and ppnr were less sensitive to changes in the long end of the yield curve as of march as compared to december due to slower forecast prepayment speeds resulting from increases in the long end of the yield curve which shortens asset duration for mbs and residential mortgages due to the lower rate environment as of march management

liabilities na net na net change as base net economic value na changes in economic value can best be described using duration which is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments for small changes in interest rates for fixedrate instruments it can also be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time to receive future cash flows whereas for floatingrate instruments it can be thought of as the weightedaverage expected time until the next rate reset the longer the duration the greater the price sensitivity for given changes in interest rates floatingrate instruments may have durations as short as one day and therefore may have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates increases in interest rates typically reduce the value of fixedrate assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher discount rates a liabilitys value decreases for the same reason in a rising rate environment a reduction in the value of a liability is a benefit to the company duration gap is the difference between the duration of assets and the duration of liabilities a duration gap near zero implies that the balance sheet is matched and thus would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for a small change in interest rates websters duration gap was negative years and negative years at march and december respectively a negative duration gap implies that liabilities are longer than assets and therefore have more price sensitivity than assets and will reset their interest rates at a slower pace consequently websters net estimated economic value would generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise as the benefit of the decreased value of liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of assets the opposite would generally be expected to occur when interest rates fall earnings would also generally be expected to increase when interest rates rise and in turn decrease when interest rates fall over the longer term absent the effects of new business booked in the future as of march longterm rates have risen by basis points as compared to december this higher starting point lengthens asset duration by decreasing residential loan and mbs prepayment speeds these estimates assume that management does not take any additional action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates both the earnings and economic values estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ management believes that websters interest rate risk position at march represents a reasonable level of risk given the current interest rate outlook management is prepared to take additional action in the event that interest rates do change rapidly for a detailed description of the

trust primarily consist of mutual funds that invest in equity and fixed income securities the company is considered the primary beneficiary of the rabbi trust as it has the power to direct the activities of the rabbi trust that most significantly affect the vies economic performance and it has the obligation to absorb losses of the vie that could potentially be significant to the vie the company consolidates the invested assets of the trust along with the total deferred compensation obligations and includes them in accrued interest receivable and other assets and accrued expenses and other liabilities respectively on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets earnings in the rabbi trust including appreciation or depreciation are reflected as other noninterest income

projects and provide a return primarily through the realization of tax benefits in most instances the investments require the funding of capital commitments in the future while the companys investment in an entity may exceed of its outstanding equity interests the entity is not consolidated as the company is not the primary beneficiary the company determined it is not the primary beneficiary due to its inability to direct the activities that most significantly impact the economic performance of the vies and the company does not have the obligation to absorb expected losses or the right to receive residual returns the company applies the proportional amortization method to account for its investments in qualified affordable housing projects at march and december the aggregate carrying

fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value is best determined using quoted market prices however in many instances quoted market prices are not available in such instances fair values are determined using appropriate valuation techniques various assumptions and observable inputs must be relied upon in applying these techniques accordingly categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement as such the fair value estimates may not be realized in an immediate transfer of the respective asset or liability fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time based on relevant market information and information about the financial instrument these estimates do not reflect any premium or discount that could result from offering for sale at one time the entire holdings or any part of a particular financial instrument fair value estimates are based on judgments regarding future expected loss experience current economic conditions risk characteristics of various financial instruments and other factors these factors are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment and therefore cannot be determined with precision changes in assumptions could significantly affect the estimates fair value hierarchy the three levels within the fair value hierarchy are as follows level valuation is based upon unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date level fair value is calculated using significant inputs other than quoted market prices that are directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability the valuation may rely on quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability such as interest rates rate volatility prepayment speeds credit ratings or inputs that are derived principally or corroborated by market data correlation or other means level inputs for determining the fair value of the respective assets or liabilities are not observable level valuations are reliant upon pricing models and techniques that require significant management judgment or estimation assets and liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis availableforsale investment securities when quoted prices are available in an active market the company classifies availableforsale investment securities within level of the fair value hierarchy us treasury bills are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy when quoted market prices are not available the company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes market spreads cash flows yield curves live trading levels trade execution data market consensus prepayments speeds credit information and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing services results and has an established process to challenge their valuations or methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected availableforsale investment securities which include agency cmo agency mbs agency cmbs cmbs clo and corporate debt are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy derivative instruments foreign exchange contracts are valued based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets and classified within level of the fair value hierarchy all other derivative instruments are valued using thirdparty valuation software which considers the present value of cash flows discounted using observable forward rate assumptions the resulting fair value is validated against valuations performed by independent third parties and are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy mortgage banking derivatives forward sales of mortgage loans and mortgagebacked securities are utilized by the company in its efforts to manage risk of loss associated with its mortgage loan commitments and mortgage loans held for sale prior to closing and funding certain singlefamily residential mortgage loans an interest rate lock commitment is generally extended to the borrower during the period from commitment date to closing date the company is subject to the risk that market rates of interest may change if market rates rise investors generally will pay less to purchase such loans resulting in a reduction in the gain on sale of the loans or possibly a loss in an effort to mitigate such risk forward delivery sales commitments are established under which the company agrees to deliver whole mortgage loans to various investors or issue mortgagebacked securities the fair value of mortgage banking derivatives is determined based on current market prices for similar assets in the secondary

managements intent to sell such loans the company generally records residential mortgage loans held for sale under the fair value option of accounting standards codification asc topic financial instruments electing to measure originated loans held for sale at fair value reduces certain timing differences and better matches changes in the value of these assets with changes in the value of the derivatives used as an economic hedge on these assets the fair value of residential mortgage loans held for sale is based on quoted market prices of similar loans sold in conjunction with

nonrecurring basis certain assets are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis that is the assets are not measured at fair value on an ongoing basis but are subject to fair value adjustments in certain circumstances for example when there is evidence of impairment at march no significant assets classified within level were identified and measured under this basis the following is a description of valuation methodologies used for assets measured on a nonrecurring basis alternative investments the measurement alternative has been elected for alternative investments without readily determinable fair values that do not qualify for the nav practical expedient the measurement alternative requires investments to be accounted for at cost minus impairment if any plus or minus changes resulting from observable price changes in orderly transactions for the identical or a similar investment of the same issuer these alternative investments are investments in nonpublic entities that generally cannot be redeemed since the investment is distributed as the underlying equity is liquidated accordingly these alternative investments are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy the carrying amount of these alternative investments was million at march no reductions for impairments or adjustments due to observable price changes were identified during the three months ended march collateral dependent loans and leases loans and leases for which the payment is expected to be provided solely by the value of the underlying collateral are considered collateral dependent and are valued based on the estimated fair value of such collateral less estimated cost to sell using customized discounting criteria accordingly such collateral dependent loans and leases are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy other real estate owned oreo and repossessed assets the total book value of oreo and repossessed assets was million at march oreo and repossessed assets are accounted for at the lower of cost or fair value and are considered to be recognized at fair value when recorded below cost the fair value of oreo is based on independent appraisals or internal valuation methods less estimated selling costs the valuation may consider available pricing guides auction results and price opinions certain assets require assumptions about factors that are not observable in an active market in the determination of fair value as such oreo and repossessed assets are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy in addition the amortized cost of consumer loans secured by residential real estate property that are in process of foreclosure amounted to million at march fair value of financial instruments and servicing assets the company is required to disclose the estimated fair value of financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate fair value as well as for servicing assets the following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for those assets and liabilities cash due from banks and interestbearing deposits the carrying amount of cash due from banks and interestbearing deposits is used to approximate fair value given the short time frame to maturity and as such these assets do not present unanticipated credit concerns cash due from banks and interestbearing deposits are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy heldtomaturity investment securities when quoted market prices are not available the company employs an independent pricing service that utilizes matrix pricing to calculate fair value such fair value measurements consider observable data such as dealer quotes market spreads cash flows yield curves live trading levels trade execution data market consensus prepayments speeds credit information and respective terms and conditions for debt instruments management maintains procedures to monitor the pricing services results and has an established process to challenge their valuations or methodologies that appear unusual or unexpected heldtomaturity investment securities which include agency cmo agency mbs agency cmbs cmbs and municipal bonds and notes are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy loans and leases net the estimated fair value of loans and leases held for investment is calculated using a discounted cash flow method based on future prepayments and market interest rates inclusive of an illiquidity premium for comparable loans and leases the associated cash flows are adjusted for credit and other potential losses fair value for collateral dependent loans and leases is estimated using the net present value of the expected cash flows loans and leases are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy deposit liabilities the fair value of demand deposits savings accounts and certain money market deposits is the amount payable on demand at the reporting date deposit liabilities are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy time deposits the fair value of a fixedmaturity certificate of deposit is estimated using the rates currently offered for deposits of similar remaining maturities time deposits are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings the fair value of securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings that mature within days is equal to the carrying value fair value for all other balances are estimated using a discounted cash flow analysis based on current market rates adjusted for associated credit risks as appropriate securities sold under agreements to repurchase and other borrowings are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy federal home loan bank advances and longterm debt the fair value of fhlb advances and longterm debt is estimated using a discounted cash flow technique discount rates are matched with the time period of the expected cash flows and are adjusted as appropriate to reflect credit risk fhlb advances and longterm debt are classified within level of the fair value hierarchy mortgage servicing assets mortgage servicing assets are initially recorded at fair value and subsequently measured under the amortization method fair value is calculated as the present value of estimated future net servicing income and relies on market based assumptions for loan prepayment speeds servicing costs discount rates and other economic factors as such the primary risk inherent in valuing mortgage servicing assets is the impact of fluctuating interest rates on the related servicing revenue stream mortgage servicing assets are reviewed quarterly and held at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value fair value adjustments if any are included as a component of loan related fees in the accompanying condensed consolidated statements of income the company recorded a thousand and a thousand charge to the valuation allowance

beginning of the fiscal year note segment reporting websters operations are organized into three reportable segments that represent its primary businesses commercial banking hsa bank and retail banking these segments reflect how executive management responsibilities are assigned the type of customer served how products and services are provided and how discrete financial information is evaluated certain treasury activities along with the amounts required to reconcile profitability metrics to those reported in accordance with gaap are included in the corporate and reconciling category effective january management realigned certain of the companys business banking and investment services operations to better serve its customers and deliver operational efficiencies also the previously reported community banking segment was renamed as retail banking under this realignment million of goodwill was reallocated on a relative fair value basis from retail banking to commercial banking there was no goodwill impairment as a result of the reorganization prior period amounts have been recasted to reflect the realignment description of segment reporting methodology webster uses an internal profitability reporting system to generate information by reportable segment which is based on a series of management estimates for funds transfer pricing and allocations for noninterest expense provision for credit losses income taxes and equity capital these estimates and allocations certain of which are subjective in nature are periodically reviewed and refined changes in estimates and allocations that affect the results of any reportable segment do not affect the consolidated financial position or results of operations of webster as a whole the full profitability measurement reports which are prepared for each reportable segment reflect nongaap reporting methodologies the differences between full profitability and gaap results are reconciled in the corporate and reconciling category webster allocates interest income and interest expense to each business through an internal matched maturity funds transfer pricing ftp process the goal of the ftp allocation is to encourage loan and deposit growth consistent with the companys overall profitability objectives the ftp process considers the specific interest rate risk and liquidity risk of financial instruments and other assets and liabilities in each line of business loans are assigned an ftp rate for funds used and deposits are assigned an ftp rate for funds provided the allocation considers the origination date and the earlier of the maturity date or the repricing date of a financial instrument to assign an ftp rate for loans and deposits originated each day the ftp process transfers the corporate interest rate risk exposure to the treasury function included within the corporate and reconciling category where such exposures are centrally managed webster allocates a majority of noninterest expense to each reportable segment using a fullabsorption costing process costs including corporate overhead are analyzed pooled by process and assigned to the appropriate reportable segment business development costs are generally included in the corporate and reconciling category the results of funds transfer pricing and allocations for noninterest expense as well as noninterest income produces pretax preprovision net revenue under which basis the segments are reviewed by executive management webster also allocates the provision for credit losses to each reportable segment based on managements estimate of the inherent loss content in each of the specific loan and lease portfolios allowance for credit losses on loans and leases is included in total assets within the

presented within note segment reporting contracts with customers did not generate significant contract assets and liabilities note commitments and contingencies creditrelated financial instruments the company offers creditrelated financial instruments in the normal course of business to meet certain financing needs of its customers that involve offbalance sheet risk these transactions may include an unused commitment to extend credit standby letter of credit or a commercial letter of credit such transactions involve to varying degrees elements of credit risk commitments to extend credit the company makes commitments under various terms to lend funds to customers at a future point in time these commitments include revolving credit arrangements term loan commitments and shortterm borrowing agreements most of these loans have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses where a fee may be required since commitments routinely expire without being funded or after required availability of collateral occurs the total commitment amount does not necessarily represent future liquidity requirements standby letters of credit a standby letter of credit commits the company to make payments on behalf of customers if certain specified future events occur the company has recourse against the customer for any amount required to be paid to a third party under a standby letter of credit which is often part of a larger credit agreement under which security is provided historically a large percentage of standby letters of credit expire without being funded the contractual amount of a standby letter of credit represents the maximum amount of potential future payments the company could be required to make and is the companys maximum credit risk commercial letters of credit a commercial letter of credit is issued to facilitate either domestic or foreign trade arrangements for customers as a general rule drafts are committed to be drawn when the goods underlying the transaction are in transit similar to a standby letter of credit a commercial letter of credit is often secured by an underlying security agreement including the assets or inventory to which they relate the following table summarizes the outstanding amounts of creditrelated financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk in thousands at march at december commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit commercial letters of credit total creditrelated financial instruments with offbalance sheet risk these commitments subject the company to potential exposure in excess of amounts recorded in the financial statements and therefore management maintains an allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments to provide for expected losses in connection with funding the unused portion of legal commitments to lend when those commitments are not unconditionally cancellable by webster loss calculation factors are consistent with the acl methodology for funded loans using pd and lgd applied to the underlying borrower risk and facility grades a draw down factor applied to utilization rates and relevant forecast information this allowance is reported as a component of accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheets the following table provides a summary of activity in the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan
