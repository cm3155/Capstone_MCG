securities called matured or paid down totaled approximately million with a yield of average cash balances held at the fed totaled billion a decrease of billion linked quarter as we deployed liquidity into loan growth and the securities portfolio average loans increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by increases in ci commercial real estate and residential mortgages this was partially

of ppp deferred fee accretion which was down from million the prior quarter remaining deferred ppp fees totaled million excluding ppp average loans grew million or average commercial loans grew million or while residential mortgage loans increased million or average deposits grew million or linked quarter the increase was driven by continued growth in commercial transactional deposits which

highlighted in the quarteroverquarter variance as well as an increase in deposit service and wealth management fees adjusted noninterest expense increased million from prior quarter reflective of seasonal increases in temporary staffing and medical expenses versus prior year noninterest expense declined million due to our previously announced efficiency initiatives resulting in lower occupancy

initiatives in technology including a new digital onboarding experience for consumers along with various initiatives to support growth in the commercial bank in the second quarter we will launch a new digital experience for employers of our hsa business we will continue to capitalize on strategic initiatives as we begin our integration with sterling turning to slide ill review the results of our fourth quarter allowance for loan loss under cecl in the quarter we reported a net provision benefit of million our allowance of million was down million the net result of adding million in reserves

wellcapitalized levels by billion with that ill turn things back over to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn its been a uniquely eventful year here at webster in addition to executing through a year impacted by the pandemic we delivered on the internal initiatives we outlined a year ago while also announcing our merger with sterling throughout it all we managed to generate strong performance broadly and particularly from a loan growth asset quality and customer service perspective i want to give a special thank you to all our bankers for continuing to perform at such a high level during a period of challenge and rapid change throughout the year weve been recognized by a number of third parties for outstanding performance market leading customer satisfaction and experience and for being a great place to work today i can share that for webster once again the top sba lender by dollar volume in new england reflecting the work of our outstanding bankers finally i again want to express how enthusiastic i am about the pending close of our merger this is a transformative transaction that will greatly benefit both banks clients colleagues communities and shareholders we are creating a unique financial institution a bank with a differentiated funding base that includes hsa bank and our combined consumer and commercial banking businesses we have a broad range of regional and national asset generation capabilities particularly through a growing commercial banking franchise with deep industry specialization and a growing geographic footprint we have a highly dense and economically robust core footprint we have the ability to draw on outstanding talent from within both organizations and we are the optimal size to be nimble and responsive to our clients while having the scale sophistication and balance sheet to meet all of our clients growing needs with that daryl glenn and i are prepared to take questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question has come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your questions christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc john maybe ill ask the question i asked when the merger was announced and asked about the pro forma growth rate of the company clearly your numbers are headed in the right direction and sterlings are ph too a little bit more bumpy can you just update us on kind of how we should be thinking about a combined organic growth in john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure and ill throw the general thought out there that with respect to all of the guidance we put out in on the 19th of april seems like a long time ago because it was that were kind of still sticking to those assumptions as we look at the marketplace now so obviously we did have really strong loan growth in the fourth quarter we had record originations we also had record payoffs sterling had good solid core loan growth a couple of mortgage warehouse and a couple of other areas were a little bit more volatile but i still think we think to annual total loan growth for the next couple of years is doable is our target taking into consideration a more competitive environment but also a continually improving economic environment with better loan demand more business confidence more consumer confidence so from an asset growth perspective i still think we dial into to net growth expectations as a combined organization over the next couple of years christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great and then my followup would be given the capital position that youre in the strong capital position how do i think about potentially getting the to versus using a buyback that youve talked about in the past john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean i think with respect to capital all of the executives on both sides that are involved are in alignment we have definitely excess capital some million to million depending on kind of onetime expenses we webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 modeled in a million share buyback because we wanted to sort of show usage of capital in our original model but as we do all the time we kind of prioritize deploying capital first to organic growth portfolio acquisitions horizontal products for some of our differentiated business lines obviously we then look at our payout ratio our dividend and depending on market conditions we have opportunistic opportunity to buyback shares so its still on the table were looking at it but i think were going to be kind of disciplined as we always are make the right economic decisions and be opportunistic chris with respect to share buybacks christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so still on the table but perhaps maybe not the full million given the momentum in growth is that a fair conclusion john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you operator thank you our next question has come from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your questions brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for the good morning thanks for the question just following up on the merger one if you could just review the size of the mortgage warehouse portfolio on a pro forma basis second how are you looking at that as a potential headwind especially with rates up pretty smartly here having choked off a lot of potential refi activity in mortgage looking like a smaller driver in addition as we think about loan growth going forward are you likely to continue to portfolio those agency loans as you have been or would you look to sell more of those john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah ill give you the general thing while glenn looks up the number on mortgage warehouse so weve been really consistent and what were going to do is were going to continue the activities in both organizations on february kind of fullspeed we love the levers there arent any asset classes or business lines right now that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 we think are either too volatile too credit risky dont make sense and we love having expanded geographies and a ton of probably more than separate commercial and consumer lending activities to draw on which means we dont have to throw the bomb or take incremental risk or give in to bad pricing conditions in any one of them so what i would say is first as it relates to mortgage warehouse it is dependent on what the market conditions are well make the right decisions in terms of putting down the accelerator or backing off depending on the risk return metrics and where we are which really applies brock to every single one of the activities were involved in having all of that diversification geographic diversification is what gives us confidence in being able to grow loans at to in areas that have good risk return metrics and what weve said in all of our nondeal roadshows and at the beginning is then over the course of the next say to months as we always do well be looking at capital deployment and saying hey are some of these business lines not as strategic or are the market dynamics not really favorable for us or are we too small to really make a difference and so well obviously redeploy capital into those areas where we can generate the most economic profit generate the most growth so i dont have any concern or view or worry about any of the asset classes i dont think that something like mortgage warehouse on the size balance sheet we have pro forma will stop us from getting to our net loan growth numbers even if things arent kind of cranking there so thats kind of where we sit and well make the appropriate capital allocation decisions further down the road brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay appreciate the color and just as a quick followup has there been any lift in the ci utilization rate yet or is that still kind of stuck where its been john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp there has been as a matter of fact i was just reviewing that so i know abl for us which is a relatively i wouldnt say small but its not a driver of overall loan growth but it had really good increase in utilization both linked quarter and significantly from last year which was pretty much a low point back up to around i think which portends well for general asset conversion cycles working capital usage building of inventory the rest of our commercial utilization was up slightly so i would say overall ci line utilization is up materially from the low a year ago not quite back to pre pandemic utilization levels brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thats great thanks for all the color john john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp you got it brock operator thank you our next question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker with compass point please proceed with your questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great hi thanks good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc just sticking with the theme of looking at you guys pro forma can you help us think about what your margin looks like if we look at it exppp plus sterling layering in the debt restructure and any other restructuring that youre doing how should wed be thinking about that glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp so hey laurie its glenn let me give you some context to that and so i think when we look at our we look at our margin were probably at a starting point of about on nim on a combined basis if i look at that sort of as for the fourth quarter anyway we are still working through were still working through most of the assumptions on accretion and marks and things like that but i can tell you that were generally in line with the disclosures that weve made on the announcement well well give you an update on that during our  earnings call laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc right glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp but with respect to looking out in asset sensitivity i mean one of the things that we are looking at is you know that both organizations are very assetsensitive and if we look at this and we say were forecasting three rate increases in one in may one in july and one in december so you dont really get the fullyear benefit of that one in december but the impact just to give you a sense of that on net interest income is about in on a fullyear basis meaning getting the benefit of three rate hikes on an annual basis its probably double a little more than double that and the dynamic there is of course that we have our loan book which is about pluspercent floating in periodic and so there are some floors against that but generally thats whats driving the asset sensitivity the other assumption of course is on the deposit beta and were currently at about beta for the first 50basispoint move and then it probably goes up to closer to like at least thats how were forecasting for the third move so i hope that gives you some sense of how were thinking about it from an asset sensitivity standpoint laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 yeah very very helpful just quick question i know you said you were still working through it but anything that you can give us in terms of accretion income what that number is going to look like either on your margin either in dollars glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp no were working through the pcdnonpcd mix as we speak as we get closer to legal day one so well give you an update on that as we get to the  earnings laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then pro forma intangibles do you have a refresh on what thats going to look like glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp same thing its all related as we make our marks and stuff like that laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc got it okay and then just on credit just hoping that you can comment a little bit on both the commercial loans your ci loan pro forma was up pretty sharply in the quarter and then from the standpoint of stl they had another cre loan sale looks like the chargeoff right there was is that just sort of fourth quarter cleanup in terms of how stl was looking at the cre theyve obviously been selling some of their special mention and substandard or how are you approaching that and just anything you can give us around your ci book thanks john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp sure laurie no i think your characterization of the asset sales at sterling is right its sort of cleanup and opportunistic without taking significant loss in nonstrategic assets which i think is prudent for us like we have two commercial loans that ended up going npl on huge obviously billion loan portfolio so we dont see anything in there thats significant and obviously we have adequate reserves and weve been really pleased quite frankly our npls came down significantly because we sold a bunch of consumer kind of older npl consumer loans actually and we were able to get a recovery at the price we sold them for so we dont think that this tickup is material were not seeing any negative trending our overall risk rating and weighted average risk rating in the portfolio is really strong so what ive said in many forums i think its almost silly how good the asset quality is but obviously were being very careful thinking about whether in any sectors or industries there is any kind of structural weakness as we come hopefully out of the pandemic with people having operated in this environment but we really see strength in ci i think they see it on the other side were focused on office the longterm how people work in office but i think everybody on both sides sterling and webster have very low loantovalues and conservative underwriting so i feel really good about ci and cre across the board in both banks webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks ill leave it there john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks laurie operator thank you our next question has come from the line of matthew breese with stephens please proceed with your question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc on page of the presentation you mentioned that over the next months you intend to unlock revenue synergies from the sterling deal you also mentioned the consolidation of facilities i was just hoping you could flesh those two items out a little bit and what are the pl and balance sheet impacts that youre alluding to john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp matt i think its a bit on the cost side glenn can walk you through kind of the high level were still working through quantifying the revenue synergies as we bring the two banks together and were going to give a lot more detail and a lot more guidance for over the next months in the first quarter combined earnings call so ill leave it there ive mentioned things like larger hold levels obviously thats something that were already benefiting from if you will with respect to our pipeline and our opportunities weve got more fee revenue opportunities across wealth and weve or weve seen some momentum there weve got great crosssell opportunities with hsa both selling on our larger commercial companies customers across both banks to hsa and hsa helping us with with others were able to invest and weve got a pretty good road map on digital investment on bankingasaservice some of the stuff you saw sterling do with respect to blockchain theres just a lot of exciting things going on and were quantifying the economic benefits none of that is kind of in the as we said in the april forward forecast so well be able to provide you kind of more economic information around those activities in the first quarter matthew breese q analyst stephens inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 understood okay john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey glenn glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yes hey matt i might be able to give you a little more context on how were thinking of this and so we look at our core operating expense for both organizations in the fourth quarter and they combined to about million so thats basically our starting point based on the fourth quarter and so you can sort of annualize that say thats sort of a core base and then as you know at the time of announcement we said we thought we could achieve million or of it for the combined organization and i think we continue to believe that thats achievable over the twoyear period so that over two years you would expect that to come out we also said at the time of announcement we thought wed get about of that or million in the first full calendar year and at the time we thought were going to close on october and thats now sort of moved to february and so that slides it out a little at least from a calendar year standpoint and so now we estimate in well probably get about million of that or and the remaining again we feel really good about getting in so you can sort of get a you can sort of take those two sort of data points the core operating expense and what our target is for as well as and sort of get a sense of how the expenses are going to roll out the only thing i would say is theres going to be seasonality in the quarterly expense numbers so youre going to see that you always see it in the first quarter where you see higher indiscernible taxes and things like that and in the fourth quarter you always see us sort of ramping up a little on temporary expense for hsa and then the other thing i would point out is that none of these include any impact of inflation to the core base and so thats something that were keenly taking a look at and then of course as laurie asked the question but things like intangibles cdis and pcdnonpcd itll all have an impact on earnings as well and then lastly any additional investments that we make in the business we decide midyear to do a liftout or something like that and theres nothing on the radar but if we decide to do something like that of course youd expect the expenses to reflect that at the end of the day well be able to provide a lot more clarity on our first quarter earnings call on how were thinking about the rest of the year as well as john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah and to put a finer point glenn mentioned wage inflation other inflationary pressures on costs i mean i think we wouldnt be genuine if we didnt think that that could be a headwind but i will say that to the extent that also results in more interest rate increases over time obviously well benefit on the top line so with respect to delivering the roatc targets the roa targets loan growth targets we feel pretty confident that regardless of the environment well be able to deliver on those matthew breese q analyst stephens inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 understood okay next one for me is just a twoparter on hsa the first one is just any sort of color on first quarter account opening just given where we are in enrollment season and then the second part is just as we rewind the tape a little bit and think about webster progressing through the last rate hiking cycle for hsa i also recall it being a time where you were heavily investing in the infrastructure of that business so as we think about the next rate hiking cycle for hsa could the profitability of the underlying subsidiary be that much better or exceed last cycle because so much of the infrastructure has already been built john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean ill take the second one first i think the answer is yes we should have more operating leverage as we move forward i think our operations are more resilient weve invested in kind of infrastructure as glenn said in the second quarter were rolling out kind of a more bespoke customer experience through this portal weve been working on so i do think while therell be kind of variable costs with respect to growth if there are opportunities that we should be able to capture more of the value as interest rates increase as it relates to this enrollment season its too early to tell our current reports are that were looking similar to last year with respect to new account growth and matt similar kind of dynamics where were continuing to do better in bringing in new employers directtoemployer and you know thats been an emphasis for us over the last say three to five years and thats really satisfying for us whats interesting is we still are seeing a bit of a muted environment in terms of new account enrollments with existing employers and so that probably is a result of the continued muted employment growth and not a lot of hiring going on across our employer customer base because if you recall the convention used to be yearin and yearout some to of our new accounts actually came from existing partners and existing customers that number is going down a little bit even if were bringing in more employers so i think that means well have more opportunity hopefully if we get a more robust hiring environment to have some more organic account growth but we still think its about kind of flat to last year when we look at january over january but obviously as you know we only have a little bit of insight into the full enrollment period in the quarter right now matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay last one for me earlier this month sterling put out a press release indicating they joined the usdf consortium youd mentioned blockchain as potential catalyst in the future where this has been most effective realtime payments has been when its applied to certain ecosystems and i couldnt help but think that with hsa you have a health care related ecosystem where realtime payments could be impactful so one maybe just curious your thoughts on realtime blockchainenabled payments banktobank and secondly could this be something that gives you a leg up on the competition hsawise thats all i had thank you john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah great question and a smart one matt so i dont want to get too far ahead of ourselves and obviously we operate both of these banks completely separately till we get to february but were obviously intimately aware of and excited about the relationships that the sterling folks have gotten into and sort of be an effective way to be a effective economic way to be a first mover to learn a lot and there are tons of use cases with respect to the usdf announcement you think about mortgage lending consumer lending you think about realtime 24hour cheap payments you think about information with respect to bsaaml webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 and also to your point fine point we do think there are opportunities given where we sit in the health care ecosystem to deploy this technology to differentiate our business there so our expectations now are weve got a lot of smart people thinking about this this gives us a front row seat i think there will be use cases that will actually be deployed in we dont have any economics built in with respect to our forecast because we want to be conservative but one of the more exciting opportunities is kind of in the health care payment space because were already kind of nestled right in there so the answer is yes operator thank you our next question has come from the line of casey haire with jefferies please proceed with your questions casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp hey casey glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp hey casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc wanted to touch on capital so you guys you and sterling both have above cet1 so legal day one you guys are going to be in great shape capitalwise could you just give us a refresh as to what ratio you is most important to you and what youll manage to pro forma glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp yeah sure casey its glenn and i think at the time of the announcement we said were looking at common equity tier and were looking at our ratio a target ratio over the course of two years to be closer to and if you look at where we are today pro forma that implies probably excess capital of about million to your point now there will be some onetime charges against that but thats where we are john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp and casey i answered the first question out of the gate too ph i dont know if you heard it i think we have put in million in stock buybacks into our model because we wanted to model an effective use of capital and as weve said in every nondeal roadshow throughout and in our last earnings call were going to continue to apply a disciplined approach to capital management here meaning first ph prize is deploy that capital into organic asset growth complementary products for our differentiated businesses portfolio purchases and then obviously we look at market conditions where our capital is and think about opportunities on the dividend and stock repurchase and were opportunistic its clearly on the table we definitely have excess capital but were going to take the same disciplined approach to making the right economic decision given market conditions at the time webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and apologies if i missed this but the securities portfolio stepped up nicely in the fourth quarter i mean you guys had outlined that but can you just give us an update as to whats the appetite to continue to grow that and then where are new money yields today versus that ph to on the fourth quarter john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah so were at and i think at alltime high going back a couple of years ago were as high as of total assets and so i dont see it and particularly with the consolidation well come back down to the low one of the things we will do casey is for the most part the sterling portfolio will be booked as afs and so that will give us that will sort of flip it it will be say afs and thatll give us optionality on the investment portfolio as well but we took those actions given our excess liquidity we drew down the excess liquidity that were holding at the fed about billion and we thought that was prudent we still have significant cash flow if you look at our investment portfolio its about million a quarter and sterlings is say million so we still have significant cash flow on both sides there and then you have the loan cash flow on top of it so i think we did this we took a little more duration on the balance sheet at you say years on what we purchased but we also preserved a lot of optionality going forward casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just last for me on the new money loan yields john r ciulla a chairman president chief executive officer webster financial corp okay casey haire q analyst jefferies llc i havent stripped out the ppp impact but obviously that was lower but overall where are they today and specifically the commercial at where are those coming in glenn i macinnes a executive vice presidentchief financial officer webster financial corp well in our yield obviously weve got significant variability in the yields depending on the mix of loans i would say let me start from a credit spread perspective were continuing to see pretty competitive market and so id say yearoveryear when we look at the origination spreads theyre down marginally but we have from a coupon perspective you think about ill give you in the quarter our sponsor specialty business at like a or ph and our commercial real estate institutional grade more closer to so we think obviously with a significant percentage of our ci and commercial real estate loans floating we get some rate increases we could see a material lift in yield and obviously a delay and increases in our deposit costs webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 is what were thinking but i would say loan yields are they were on origination in commercial on a blended basis which is driven again largely by where those originations come from casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you john r
