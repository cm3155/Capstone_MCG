loans totaling billion for both existing and new customers we funded every qualified applicant that completed the loan process our philanthropic activities continue to be focused on making an immediate and direct impact on those most affected by covid19 and in addition and more recently in helping organizations that are poised to make a difference at the inflection point to racial equality and economic opportunity ill now turn to financial highlights on slide websters second quarter results demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong execution on our strategic priorities we feel good about our performance in the quarter particularly in light of the challenging operating environment preprovision net revenue of million was down approximately from  driven by lower total revenue partially offset by a decline in expenses earnings per share in the quarter were or when adjusted for a million valuation adjustment that glenn will discuss in his remarks this compares to in  and in the prioryears second quarter consistent with last quarter glenn will walk you through the assumptions underlying cecl process and resulting provision for the quarter our million provision results in a million reserve build our second quarter return on common equity was and return on tangible common equity was on slide loan growth was solid as loans grew from a year ago or when excluding billion in ppp loans commercial loans grew almost from a year ago or by more than billion linked quarter nonppp commercial loan balances declined modestly but the decline was driven almost entirely by a reduction in line utilization in fact commercial banking nonppp origination and payoff activity was largely in line with the prioryears second quarter the decline in floating and periodic rate loans to total loans reflects fixed rate ppp loans added in the quarter deposits grew yearoveryear driven across all business lines transactional and hsa deposits now represent of total deposits up from a year ago slides through set forth key performance statistics for our three lines of business on slide in commercial banking excluding ppp loans balances were up from a year ago cre was the primary driver of yearover year growth as i mentioned earlier loan balances in the quarter were materially impacted by lower line utilization a significant amount of the defensive line draws were repaid and our assetbased lending group saw a reduction in outstanding loan balances as slower economic activity reduced our customers need for receivables and inventory support webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 deposits were up sharply in commercial banking due to a cash build in our clients balance sheets commercial deposits were up linked quarter and from a year ago marking an alltime high for that line of business higher loan and deposit volumes drove a yearoveryear increase in net interest income in commercial banking while expenses were down commercial ppnr was up compared to prioryear due to the net interest income increase and strong expense discipline on slide you will notice that we have modified our slide presentation slightly for hsa bank our slide now shows our core accounts and deposits as well as those associated with our tpa partners weve done this in order to provide more clarity regarding the decision of two tpa partners to transition accounts and balances to their internal solutions this is what we promised we would do when we communicated the tpa transitions to the market late last year covid19 has had a mixed impact on the overall hsa business in  account openings were modestly lower than prioryear due to slower hiring trends across our employer customers while outside the tpa channel deposit balance growth remained strong at yearoveryear due in part to reduced consumer spending in the period so higher balances helped nii while the spending declined had a negative impact on our interchange revenue hsa consumer spending did begin to pick up late in the quarter a trend we see continuing as elective medical services continue to open up across the country we saw a strong increase in new business opportunities late in the quarter winning more new hsa rfps than we did last year specifically in the large employer space this is a positive early sign for in our dte channel in the quarter tpa accounts and balances declined and million respectively representing the beginning of the anticipated loss of accounts in that channel as we have mentioned several times in the past the tpa channel has materially lower average account balances than our core accounts due to our limited interaction with the account holders the accounts that left in had an average deposit balance of per account compared to for our core customer accounts as disclosed last quarter we are on track to close and onboard new account holders from state farm bank early in the third quarter the related deposit balances approximate million or about per account although the pandemic had introduced some volatility into hsa bank performance metrics the fundamentals of hsa bank and the broader hsa market remained strong with ample opportunity for continued growth im now on page community banking loans grew by yearoveryear and by excluding ppp loans mortgage originations were strong and the pipeline remains robust lendingclub balances totaled just million at june down another million from march as that portfolio continues to be in runoff mode community banking deposits grew by yearoveryear with consumer and business deposits growing by and respectively our total cost of community banking deposits was basis points in the quarter compared to basis points a year ago noninterest income was down primarily driven by lower deposit service charges resulting from higher average balances and lower retail spend due to covid19 mortgage banking and business banking swap fees saw a meaningful yearoveryear growth reflecting the continued shift in consumer preferences of total transactions in the quarter were selfservice and mobile banking households grew by yearoveryear webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 turning to the next two slides ill talk about credit our june reported credit metrics remained relatively and remarkably stable reflecting the increased level of economic stress partially offset by the impact of government stimulus and loan modification and deferral programs we expect to see continued pressure on credit as our forward forecast of economic conditions remains less favorable and we anticipate the continuation of a challenging business environment due to the pandemic overall delinquencies classified assets nonaccrual loans and net chargeoffs modestly deteriorated from prior quarter but remained within recent ranges glenn will talk specifically about these metrics in a moment on slide with respect to commercial loans weve updated our disclosure on the sectors most directly impacted by covid and included updated modification information key takeaways are that overall exposure to these sectors has declined defensive line draws in these sectors and across the commercial bank have largely been repaid new modification requests have slowed dramatically and the absolute number of loan modifications in force has declined from its peak on slide we provide more detail across our entire billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio i think theres a lot of good information on this slide at the end of the second quarter approximately billion or of our funded loan portfolio was under some sort of modification on may when we filed our first quarter 10q modified loans represented just under billion or of our portfolio as you can see our modified loans have come down materially i think its also important to note that almost half of the commercial loan modifications in effect at june are not related to modification of payment terms meaning the borrower is still paying principal and interest as originally contracted in these instances we provided covenant relief borrowing base adjustments additional liquidity or other concessions with respect to paymentrelated modifications we have seen more than an million or decline in modified loan dollars since may and while its way too early to declare victory overall modification trending is encouraging the overall portfolio weighted average risk rating has deteriorated modestly as a result of the economic stress however the vast majority of our risk rating downgrades have occurred within the past rating categories we are actively monitoring risk we are making realtime credit rating decisions and addressing potential credit issues proactively impact of the virus the pace of reopening or reclosing the economy across geographies and the potential for additional government stimulus actions will all help determine the ultimate outcome of credit performance not only for us but for the rest of our industry we continue to feel good about the quality of our underwriting our portfolio management capabilities and our capital position finally before i turn it over to glenn id like to comment on capital management first we remain completely focused on internal execution we have a strong capital position enabling us to continue to support our customers and assist in the broader financial recovery as we announced tuesday our board has approved a quarterly dividend of per share given our current economic baseline forecast anticipated earnings and capital position we anticipate continuation of the dividend at its current level if conditions deteriorate significantly we will make the appropriate decisions relating to our webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 dividend as we will always ensure we can take care of our customers our bankers our communities and our shareholders and we will not repurchase our stock until the pandemic is behind us ill now turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john ill begin with our average balance sheet on slide average loans grew almost billion or linked quarter our commercial portfolio grew by billion driven primarily by million in ppp loans in the second quarter we funded over ppp loans loans had an average balance of with a median balance of over of the loans were less than the ppp loans include around million to new customers with the remainder going to the existing webster customer base we expect of the loans will be forgiven over the second half of but timing will depend on final sba guidelines and customer preferences we believe that approximately twothirds of the ppp funds remained in customer deposits accounts at quarterend outside of ppp loans commercial loans grew million ci loans grew by million reflective of line draws which began late in the first quarter along with growth in public sector finance in addition commercial real estate loans grew million as a result of higher activity in our investor cre and middlemarket businesses on a yearoveryear basis commercial real estate loans have grown by more than billion the million decline in consumer loans is the result of reductions of million in residential mortgages and million in home equity deposits increased billion linked quarter reflecting substantial pandemicrelated commercial and consumer liquidity demand deposits represented billion of this increase commercial and business banking demand deposits grew billion or the average consumer demand deposit increased over per account or representing million of growth as a result borrowings declined by million with fhlb advances representing the majority of the reduction borrowings included million of balances from the utilization of the ppp liquidity facility regulatory risk weighted capital ratios increased due to growth in equity and a decrease in risk weighted assets risk weighted assets decreased as a result of the addition of risk weighted ppp loans as well as a decline in risk weighted commercial loans the increase in asset balances impacted our tangible common equity ratio by basis points which was more than offset by retained earnings and an increase in the net unrealized gain in our afs portfolio tangible book value per share at quarterend was an increase of from march 31st and from prioryear slide summarizes our income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings net interest income declined million from prior quarter lower rates resulted in quarteroverquarter decline of million in revenue from earning assets this was partially offset by million due to balanced growth and million due to lower deposits and borrowing costs as a result our net interest margin was basis points lower quarteroverquarter basis points was the result of earning asset yield partially offset by basis points from lower deposit costs and basis points from lower borrowing costs in addition ppp loans represented another basis points of the linked quarter nim decline versus prioryear net interest income declined million million of the decline was the net result of lower market rates with a partial offset of million from earning asset growth webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 noninterest income decreased million linked quarter and million from prioryear deposit service fees declined million quarteroverquarter with overdraft fees declining million hsa deposit fees decreased million linked quarter with interchange representing million of the decline as a result of lower spend we also saw quarteroverquarter pressure on wealth management related fees which was partially offset by higher mortgage banking activity another million of the quarteroverquarter reduction in noninterest income was due to a discrete fair value adjustment on our customer hedging book the decrease in noninterest income from prioryear reflects the lower level of deposit service fees the fair value adjustment with a partial offset from higher mortgage banking revenue reported noninterest expense of million declined both linked quarter and from prioryear and is reflective of continued expense discipline preprovision net revenue was million in  this compares to million in  and million in prioryear the provision for credit loss for the quarter was million which i will discuss in more detail shortly the efficiency ratio of compares to in  reflecting lower quarteroverquarter revenue with an offset from lower expense and our effective tax rate was compared to in  turning to slide i will review the results of our second quarter allowance for loan losses under cecl as you can see the allowance for credit losses to loans increased to or excluding ppp loans for the quarter net chargeoffs were million our loan loss provision of million consisted of two components first a reduction of million driven by lower loan balances primarily due to lower commercial credit utilization at quarterend and second an increase of million which is reflective of our updated economic forecast the provision reflects the moodys june economic forecast the forecast has unemployment peaking at in  declining to in  and on average for gdp is forecasted to decline on a fullyear basis by in annualized yearoveryear gdp growth will not turn positive until mid2021 key drivers for the provision or changes in the economic forecast risk rating migration loan modification and deferral trends as well as the impact of the fed stimulus programs the million allowance reflects our best estimate of life of loan losses as of june we will continue to assess the macroeconomic environment and the impact on our credit quality as we move through the pandemic in addition to our quarterly cecl process we continue to run several stress scenarios reviewing the results with management the board and regulators the results inform our thinking on future performance liquidity and operating capital which remained strong and in excess of wellcapitalized levels slide highlights our key asset quality metrics as of june nonperforming loans in the upper left increased million from  residential mortgage and consumer loans represented million of the increase with million driven by smaller exposures in cre and middlemarket net chargeoffs in the upper right increased from  and totaled million in the quarter ci increased million primarily reflecting two restaurant chains and our sponsor portfolio that were experiencing difficulty prior to the onset of the pandemic commercial classified loans in the lower left represented basis points of total commercial loans this compares to a quarter average of basis points the allowance for credit loss increased to million as discussed on the prior slide webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 slide highlights our liquidity metrics our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with a strong base for loan growth more than billion of deposit growth in  funded more than million in loan growth and lowered the loantodeposit ratio to we are predominantly core deposit funded with no brokered cds at june in addition our sources have secured borrowing capacity totaled billion at june the increase of almost billion from march reflects billion of unused ppp collateral at the fed and the pay down of fhlb advances slide highlights our strong capital metrics our regulatory capital ratios exceed wellcapitalized levels by substantial amounts our common equity tier ratio of exceeds wellcapitalized by more than billion likewise tier riskbased capital exceeds wellcapitalized levels by million with respect to our outlook the impact of the pandemic on the economy continues to present nearterm challenges average earning asset growth net interest income and nim will be influenced by the timing and amount of ppp forgiveness and repayment activity assuming market rates do not go below zero ppnr has modest risk to further declines in shortterm rates noninterest income will be influenced by the pace of deposit service fees in hsa bank and community banking we will continue to remain disciplined on our expense management and our share count should remain relatively flat as we do not anticipate any near share repurchases with that ill turn things back over to john john r ciulla chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks a lot glenn id like to provide some perspective on our longer term operating goals and execution strategies before we open it up to questions as you know our goal is to allocate capital and focus business strategies for the purpose of maximizing economic profits over time for consecutive quarters we were able to grow revenue periodoverperiod distinguishing ourselves from our peers the differentiated strength of our company has been deploying low cost high growth hsa and core consumer deposits into market leading specialized and sophisticated ci and cre commercial loan growth across an expanding set of industry verticals and geographies our view of the macroeconomic environment over the next several years is that rates will be lower for longer and economic growth will be modest as i mentioned beginning in our january earnings call we believe we have meaningful opportunity to change the cost structure supporting our delivery of products and services to our customers across all business lines without limiting the effectiveness or growth or value of our differentiated businesses we have been and remained focused on operational efficiencies and revenue enhancements across the organization beginning well before the onset of the pandemic and with the pandemic accelerating changes in customer preferences and shifting workplace dynamics opportunities to fully align expenses with our business line execution only get broader our goal continues to be generating returns in excess of our estimated cost of capital over the medium and longterm and well work diligently to achieve that goal donna with that glenn chad jason and i are prepared to take questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question is coming from steve alexopoulos of jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i can start on credit so if you look at the deferral slide most of the trends were favorable to but the one that does standout is the most scrutinized is leverage lending which saw modifications rise since may could you give color on what youre seeing there and should we translate higher deferrals into eventual higher losses in that bucket john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean this the big question is the translation of embedded loss from the modifications right we obviously look carefully if customers need some sort of modification that shows that theyve got some sort of potential weakness ill let jason comment on some of the stuff one of the things steve on the leverage portfolio again is not all of the modifications are paymentrelated and if you think about both in our general sponsor book and those leveraged loans within sponsor the things were encouraged by were doing a lot of modifications that are simply providing the customer with some more flexibility with respect to covenant or liquidity or some of the other covenantbased modifications and we know that we have sponsors behind the vast majority of those deals who have significant equity in the transactions and how are working with us really closely so for me i dont get alarmed that thats one of the higher categories youd expect in a leverage situation that would be a company that might need a little bit more modification and flexibility but were not seeing sort of systemic weakness in that portfolio at all and jason maybe you want to give your perspective jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation yeah no happy to join i think youre right if you look at the amount in the slide of it is not payment related right and so the other is and if you even break down that further there is a portion of that thats just the principal deferral but they continue to pay interest so ultimately we worry a little bit less about the covenant modification versus the payment modification webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 and what ill also tell you is that a lot of sponsors have indicated that theyre willing to support these companies even in some of the most impacted sectors right but they want sort of a short window to assess the situation and environment and how quickly the borrowers will recover before they decide to cut a check and figure out what the longterm solution is so right now im cautiously encouraged by the conversations were having with these sponsors and i think the right point is that a good or the only of them are actually paymentrelated steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats actually helpful and then if we look at the slide with the updated covid19 exposures can you walk us through what reviews youve now done on those portfolios and now that youve had more time to assess the risk there how do you think about risk in those buckets thanks john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp jason do you want me to take that one directly jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation and so youre talking specifically about the sectors or steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation okay steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the slide that calls out restaurant hotel leisure et cetera all those impacted sectors jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation yeah so the rigor review around these sectors is ill call it significant all right we have a normal course review of problem assets weve had separate special reviews focusing on just things like restaurants travel leisure hotel and motel we required an escalation of decision making modifications on any deals that carry a certain risk rating which in the past would have been done without coming to my level so weve been very very proactive in looking at all these exposures and challenging ourselves to make sure we dont have any blind spots of future problems in these sectors and most of my comments are around our larger structure businesses which carry the higher exposure but i will tell you that also on some of our smaller flow business weve also taken approach on things like restaurants that if over of your revenue has gone as a result of the situation we just gone straight to a downgrade because we cant have the same level of review and rigor on a loan as we can on a million loan so i feel webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 really good about the weekly rhythm almost that we have on all these accounts and all the controls in place to make sure that we dont have blind spots steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and then if i could just maybe as chad on hsa bank just a big picture question of what youre seeing have layoffs impacted contributions our employees that are still working still contributing like in the past and then we talked about employers maybe looking a full replacement are you seeing that how is this environment impacting that business thanks charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah thanks steve id say that we havent seen a lot of impact from the furloughs and the layoffs so really not a big uptick in closed accounts we have seen the i guess a slowdown in new accounts with existing employers so as employers have kind of paused on hiring as weve gone through the pandemic and john spoke to the slowdown in our spend levels that was had dropped down to about were currently in june we came back to about and that conversely has added a little bit of growth to or more growth to our deposits as folks arent spending as much contribution levels have remained about the same and thats why were seeing an uptick in growth on deposit so we really havent seen much of an impact on the contribution levels just really the spend levels as i look to the rest of the year i think the as the economy is still in a difficult spot the enrollments with new employers remained a little bit depressed we had a dip in our pipeline as we went through march and april but it came back really strong in june and in july and weve had actually had one of our best sale seasons ever in the large employer market so its looking good for oneone its too early to tell whether thats indicative of a you know some tailwinds coming in the industry as a result of the impact on the economy so well see how that unfolds as we get into steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp steve thanks operator thank you our next question is coming from collyn gilbert of kbw please go ahead collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey collyn webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just a followup first on steves question about hsa so chad are you with july being obviously a big enrollment period are there are you seeing any or any other employers are they capable of doing it number one and number two are you seeing it where theyre extending the enrollment periods out by say a quarter or so because of just the workathome environment is occurring or is there not a lot of flexibility on some of the way these plans are structured that they can extend that july enrollment period charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah thanks collyn we have not seen any changes in the timing of enrollments and i dont anticipate seeing any changes to the point you made its a little inflexible there we thought we were seeing a pause in folks putting their benefit packages out to bid because they were just so distracted with everything that was going on just responding to the pandemic however thats just come back and i feel like were ahead of last years levels at this point in terms of bids and opportunities because of everything that got pushed back a little bit collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful and then just in terms of potential ma within this sector are you guys seeing any other opportunities coming your way similar to what you have closing with state farm or how this current environment maybe has impacted portfolios and businesses that have come available for you in the hsa space john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah collyn ill take a crack and then let chad follow up i mean i think we remain committed to looking at inorganic opportunities to grow this special business so from our perspective were still as engaged i will tell you given the sort of you know overhang of the pandemic lower value perceived value of deposits and growth trajectory i think sellers are maybe more reluctant to engage in a transaction at this time so i would sort of say the odds of us executing on more inorganic opportunities are lower but our desire remains just as significant as it was before chad i dont know if you have a perspective there charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah the only thing id add to that john because i agree with everything you said is that there may be some players in this space who are going to struggle with the lower interest rate environment as you see it sizable decrease in the revenue that might create some opportunity but otherwise absolutely i agree with everything collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful and then just on the expense side if we think about this a little bit longer term are there i know you guys have alluded to maybe at some point that theres something that you might be able to do with the boston franchise or just can you just kind of give us an update on how youre seeing your branch network just infrastructure set up now and if theres areas where you think both in the nearterm and longterm you can look to rationalize webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure collyn i was pretty purposeful in my final comments there weve been working across the entire organization on things like automation on looking at whether or not our entire infrastructure and expense base is fully aligned with kind of our narrowtargeted growth opportunities in businesses and obviously our physical footprint both office space and banking centers is something that we review as we talk about all the time and i do think that coming out of this pandemic its really put a highlight on the fact that consumer preferences are changing and we can deliver more effectively digitally and theres less reliance on the banking centers so i do think youll expect to see us along with a lot of other players in the industry be a little bit more aggressive at reducing square footage making sure that we still can deliver our products and services to our customers and what id say to followup on my prepared remarks earlier is that you know well be able to quantify that a little bit more as we head into the third and fourth quarter for the market collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then just lastly just on the loan activity in the quarter and if you covered this in some of the initial comments i apologize i missed it but just the declines that you saw on loan balances and maybe what your expectation is for activity in the back half of the year john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah sure i mean it was a really interesting quarter actually we onboarded some great new customers one of the strengths and its fortunate in terms of the people how we reflected risk one of the strengths in that sponsor business is that our largest concentration is around technology infrastructure data centers fiber those kind of transactions which are just actually benefiting from the marketplace so weve continued onboard some really good credits one of my comments i did make earlier is that the nonppp reduction in commercial balances was entirely driven by line utilization so repayment of defensive line draws along with a probably the biggest reduction ive ever seen or contraction in abl utilization given whats just going on with working capital the actual stated numbers of originated dollars and payoffs were almost exactly in line in commercial banking with a year ago second quarter which is kind of remarkable when you think about the economic slowdown so i think going forward now that weve kind of balanced out the utilization youll continue to see modest loan growth from us obviously the economic environment impacts it but we have a decent pipeline as we head into the third quarter and were open for business understanding that our underwriting criteria changes a bit with the overhang of the pandemic collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great i will leave it there thanks john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks collyn webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 operator thank you our next question is coming from mark fitzgibbon of piper sandler please go ahead mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning mark great to hear from you mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co likewise john given the differences between states on the covid shutdowns im curious are the credit dynamics for business customers markedly different sort of across your footprint and could you maybe give us some color on that john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah thats a great question i dont think theres sort of a systemic or kind of repeatable underwriting change as we go throughout our footprint i do think interesting dynamics even with whats been happening lately weve been seeing boosted real estate prices in fairfield and westchester because people are leaving the city so what id say mark is i think that when were underwriting transactions if you think about small businesses which is more volumedriven i think were looking out systemically for industries that may be more vulnerable to this economic landscape and the pandemic and some of the shifts in geography as we get into the commercial bank underwriting which really creditbycreditbycredit i think we certainly take into consideration the dynamics in the geographies so what youve seen in our branch footprint for massachusetts rhode island new york and connecticut is a consistent sort of slow march to reopening and a little bit more activity and so were seeing a little bit more loan activity i dont think theres a differentiation between those four states i think those four states are doing pretty well there are areas our national restaurant franchise business we are not originating there now theres just too much variability and theres just too much uncertainty as it relates to specific geographical challenges so i cant really give you any trends we havent seen it in credit performance in delinquencies in consumer we havent had sort of hotspots and i hate to use that phrase because particularly the situation but we havent seen kind of hotspots of poor credit performance in commercial or business banking based on geography its more sectordriven jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation hey john can i add something john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation what i would say if youre looking at our modification book and you look at those customers that are asking for second round accommodations if you will within our business banking portfolio weve had well over over million mature of the initial million or so and only million of that has actually asked for a second round deferral and so i take that as cautious encouragement within our footprint and what were hearing from borrowers are look were not quite sure how things are going to play out but weve got some good liquidity and so were comfortable resuming payments at this point so take up what its worth but i do view that as a slight indication of some part of the positive trend mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just a followup for chad chad i was curious if you think you still have room to push hsa deposit costs down even further or are we sort of bottoming out here at basis points charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah i think that weve seen some more movement in the market were paying really close attention to whats going on across our competitors and i think we have room to move still mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so mark its glenn if i could add just add to that so sort of basis points for the quarter but thats reflective of changes midquarter so you get a full quarter of that going into third quarter or probably be closer to between around basis points mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then glenn i know youre not giving guidance but i wondered if you could help us think about some of the major moving parts on operating expenses in thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so john sort of touched on operating expenses i would think all things considered you would think it would probably be in ph to range somewhere around there excluding any significant investments that we make and then just going forward obviously i was if you think about guidance going forward a lot of it is predicated on the ppp forgiveness and our thoughts on that i indicated by the yearend but you know its anyones guess if comes in the third quarter or webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks a lot mark operator thank you our next question is coming

can you talk about how youre feeling about this portfolio and modification activity or deferral activity there john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure ill give a quick overview and then let jason drive on some points ive always said when asked about the commercial real estate portfolio that weve been a sort of low risk low return business bill wrang that runs that business i always mention his name on the earnings calls because i think we deal with topnotch sponsors and we have a very much of an institutional book my view is i feel comfortable given the debt service coverage ratios the sponsors and the ltvs where we are now but i would acknowledge as ceo one of the longterm concerns i have is what happens with some of the commercial real estate sectors over time with changing work dynamics with changing retail dynamics and so i really like where we are now both from a propertytype distribution and from an underwriting distribution and sponsor support perspective but i think if anything i mentioned earlier you kind of have to wait and see how credit plays out with all of these macro variables i think commercial real estate is going to be the last one to kind of figure out what happens there just given some of maybe the longterm shifts jason maybe you want to address that questions more specifically jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation yeah no happy to john and youve mentioned sort of the ratios and the metrics overall in that book within commercial real estate where we have a lot of weighted average the loan to value ph and there are sort of debt service coverage going into the environment obviously thatll see some impact webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 i think the more important thing is of our commercial real estate portfolio is nondiscretionary versus discretionary anchored by pharmacy and retail and so weve seen a real difference in terms of rent collection rates in those sectors and so far weve provided relatively modest accommodations on that portfolio six loans about million in exposure so again im never going to claim on this call that were out of the woods on anything just given the environment so far our performance in that book has been relatively strong david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks for that and sticking with credit it was good to see the provision down in the second quarter versus the first quarter how should we think about provision for the second half of the year given all the uncertainty charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah so i think with respect to cecl you nailed that i mean there is a significant amount of uncertainty at this point and so we just continue well update our models well continue to look at the macroeconomic factors risk ratings loan modification trends as well as you know as we get further clarity on the impact of stimulus on the portfolio so i think its sort of hard to its hard to give a number going forward but well continue to monitor that john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah dave i mean its interesting right to simplify it as much as you can if the forward economic forecast deteriorates that leads to higher provision risk rating trends within your portfolio depending on which way they go impact it and then other sort of more qualitative borrower behaviors like modifications and other things kind of factor in and so those are the variables the high level variables and then of course so in government stimulus and other customer behaviors and thats where we go so this was a pretty simple one as glenn went through we had a reduction in our forward outlook we had some good news on modification activity and we had some slight downtick in our risk rating and we ended up where we are here and so those are the things that will give you some directional sense as to where we might be going forward david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks for that and then on the net interest margin and clearly theres going to be a lot of noise in the nearterm you mentioned about the uncertainty around when the ppp loans are forgiven but if we were to fast forward to say the second quarter of or the third quarter of if we were to assume interest rates are flat remaining very low here do you have a sense as to where the net interest margin could be john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc ph first the ppp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure within a range i mean i think if you look at onemonth libor we pushed that out at basically basis points fed funds to basis points and maybe a slight increase in the tenure and you can look at the impact of that in our slides whether you think that rate is going to come down but if i do all that and i look at our asset growth i think youd be modestly below where we are today and thats and you pretty much bottom out at that point but youre right about ppp i think over the next two quarters that will create a lot of noise within nim as well as net interest income david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc and just one quick one on hsa you mentioned about how the pipeline for rfps heading into the season is picking up for june and july do you have a sense as to how that compares to the pipeline a yearago john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp chad do you want to take that one charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah absolutely id make two comments on that one is the pipeline is up modestly yearoveryear and we started out much stronger it died down for a couple of months and then snap back right back to actually above prior levels so little bit above last year its the win rate thats really up significantly yearoveryear in the large employer space because were in the large employer selling season right now which has been delayed a little bit as well david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question is coming from jared shaw of wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey jared webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just i guess circling back to the provision the allowance and it looks like the moodys model for july deteriorated just a little bit incrementally versus june but if we assume that broadly the economic model doesnt change much and you start seeing actual loan level losses do you think that the current allowance is enough to cover that or do you be inclined to continue to provide for incremental losses sort of given the broader continued uncertainty around the economy glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah i mean right now jared its glenn we think the million we have right now is adequate and is reflective of loss content in our book and it is as john just pointed out on the last question i mean it is a matter of looking at risk ratings loan modifications and the macroeconomic forecast and then on top of that the stimulus but a bigger part of this is looking at the duration of the pandemic and the impact to our customer whether its a retail customer or a commercial customer their liquidity profile so thats something that sort of hard to give you a number but i think where we are at the end of the second quarter is reflective of what we see right now and so if moodys stays about where it is then you have to look internally and you have to look at your risk rating migration you have to look at liquidity on the customer bases and then modification trends so those are the other factors that wed look at jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then i guess keeping with that i guess how were the trends in internal credit migration during the quarter and are all the modified loans automatically downgraded or put on watch lists or how are you looking i guess internally at dealing with those credits john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp ill let jason take the second one jared i mentioned earlier just with respect to internal risk rating migration that our weighted average risk rating deteriorated modestly in the quarter but the interesting dynamic there was the vast majority and i mean almost all of it occurred within passrating categories and so if you think about that if were accurately risk rating which we think we do and our regulators think we do those are passgraded credits that we would underwrite even at their slightly deteriorated level so that has an impact on pushing the provision slightly higher but as we said it wasnt a material shift because there wasnt a big inflow into criticized and classified assets and the reason i mentioned it proactively in my remarks is i also want the market to understand that were not punting forward or kicking the can on risk identification and risk rating so we know were looking at our credits when information is provided to us and were talking to all of our big commercial customers and were making the appropriate assessments on a daily basis where we can get information and we take those circumstances and make the right call jason do you want to talk specifically about what modification means with respect to risk rating jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 yeah no ill just talk a little bit about our overall approach right so its not an automatic downgrade if somebody is being modified it certainly depends on a number of factors whether its a payment modification whether its a temporary covenant modification bridge to a broader solution as i mentioned before right and our approach is really of course more forwardlooking than just looking at historical metrics given the current environment were specifically assessing whether the borrower has adequate liquidity to make it through this environment until revenue returns to reasonable level and as we know overall liquidity has been enhanced by ppp deferrals and in some industries advanced payments and grants like in healthcare in our larger structure businesses where youre having a lot of these conversations on meaningful risk ratings were getting cash flow projections that will really help influence our decision on ratings and were actively tracking the true liquidity on a weekly basis versus what the companies were projecting and the revenue associated with that in some of our smaller businesses were downgrading by sector so well continue to address and adjust our ratings as we get more borrowerspecific information and obviously within the context of the overall economic environment but its not an automatic downgrade just because theyve asked for a deferral jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats a great color thanks and then just finally for me glenn you mentioned ppp forgiveness assumed to be in whats your total assumption for forgiveness out of the whole portfolio im sorry over the life of the portfolio glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp i think we go all the way through probably the end of the first quarter of so it drops down if you think about it this way jared say in  and in  so thats of a writedown and most of it sort of just trends down throughout jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc so like so assume like a total forgiveness level for the glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah by the end of i think thats a good number jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 operator thank you our question is coming from steven duong of rbc capital markets please go ahead steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey good morning steven steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey most of my questions have been answered so just a highlevel general question the moodys economic forecast that you guys look at how do you in your experience how does that compare to what you guys went through during the financial crisis john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp its hard to handicap its a different form of economy and that you have the sharp real sharp gdp so you go from negative gdp in  to minus and likewise unemployment and so its sort of very steep and then a snapback in some respect glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thats exactly right john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp i think its interesting because obviously the banking the industry as a whole is doing a lot more stress testing and has a lot more capabilities to forecast now than when we went through this during the great recession but whats interesting is i think glenn hit the nail on the head were dealing with something here thats difficult because theres a big exigent shock right away and then theres a lot of uncertainty about the path of the recovery whereas the financial crisis just had a longer duration and it was kind of cumulative losses over time and so i think thats what i would say is that its a different shape of economic forecast with a lot more uncertainty going forward as to the shape of the recovery glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and steven i just look if you look at our worst performing four quarters in during the financial crisis in and i think our lost content was like basis points so thats just four quarters i mean i think this is a reference point steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 right right i guess like you know the snapback the moodys is forecasting i guess were experiencing such dramatic numbers going like drop and then the bounce off that lower base do you ever you guys think that the absolute level of economic activity matters at all when were talking about such gigantic numbers but gdp level is it does that matter into how businesses are running and how they perform going forward john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp youre asking great philosophical questions i actually think and ill give you my editorial right i think that all of the that the whole cecl framework is a reasonable model framework but i think what youre getting at and our belief is theres a bit of a disconnect right now between the direct correlation on things like unemployment gdp shock its not immediately correlated and so what you have is we need to wait and see because particularly with the government stimulus coming in and sort of muting a lot of the impacts i dont think that when you look at gdp or you look at the unemployment posted number that its really reflective of what were going to see with respect to consumer credit behaviors or whats going whether a small business is going to make a decision so if thats where youre going i think we need to wait and see how predictive some of these variables are going forward particularly with the bounce back and the huge gdp decline in glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and steven i would just add i mean it is going to be as we said a few times now its more duration and so you look at our numbers and you look at the ppp loans as a percent of total loans and its pretty significant so even under that modification numbers that we talked about payment modification is a significant number of ppp loans if you look at our consumers and their average dda accounts is up so theyre feeling pretty good our overdrafts are down right the 20pluspercent steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc right glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp quarteroverquarter so that cant we know that cant last forever but its a matter of looking out on duration and saying how strong is the liquidity profile of our clients and can they see their way through the other side of this and so thats what were focused on john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp and again just an editorial if youre a management team if youre our management team youre less focused on whether all of there were all of these variables are accurately correlated to performance and what the shape of the curve is youre just looking at all of the potential outcomes and the duration and making sure youre making smart decisions that will help you under a wide variety of potential economic outcomes steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 great point guys really appreciate thank you john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks steven operator thank you our next question is coming from matthew breese of stephens please go ahead matt breese q analyst stephens inc good morning john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey matt how are you today matt breese q analyst stephens inc good just couple of quick ones so it seems like theres a mixed view from the industry on how long deferrals could extend and the idea of a longterm deferrals emerged as it becomes apparent there are parts of there are businesses and parts of the economy that could be impacted going to do you think you have this type of flexibility and then practically speaking will you exercise it or should we expect after days of deferral john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp matt you cut out a little bit there i think we got the gist of the question and ill give you a quick thought and then hand it over to jason we were actually talking about this yesterday internally so i think theres kind of a natural cadence given where we are given the fact that people still view fundamentally that this is a temporary disruption that youll have your original modifications jason gave you some indication that were surprised pleasantly that theres a lower number of people who are on modification asking for a second modification but were still under the cares act were still in a place we want to help our customers we were talking about what would happen if we sort of get into what we would call kind of the third wave of modifications and i think our view institutionally is that we really have to take a strong look to your point at what the underlying fundamental strength of the businesses are over the longterm before we just blindly grant a third wave modification so i think what youll see in the industry is after the first days or second days or days or days however theyre done under the cares act protection nontdr modifications i think not just because of the way we have to account for them but also because we really want to look and see whether or not some of these businesses are permanently impaired or impacted i think you wont see sort of just continued modification after modification as we go into kind of a third wave if you will anything to add on that jason webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 jason soto a chief credit risk officer webster financial corporation yeah i think the only thing i would add is if theres probably going to be a bifurcation between the types of business types of products right i mean if youre talking consumer small business going to third wave we have to start thinking about all right is this permanently impaired or should we be talking sort of loss mitigation type stuff at that point whereas i sort of just take on the commercial side and sponsor right you may have a situation where we granted an additional waiver the sponsor in the second amendment agreed to put in a few million dollars because the lions share of the revenue that they were expecting in the second half of year is gone take a company that puts on events and conferences thats just not going to happen this year right and so they put a temporary bandaid on but we all know that in early when they have their slate of events laid out there may be a third round which is a broader solution with some equity maybe some incremental deferrals on payments and thats just the way it works more on the structured larger deals so i think the answer is different depending on what business youre talking about matt breese q analyst stephens inc understood so practically speaking you have the option to carry deferrals well into but case by case as to whether youll exercise it or move it to npa john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp i think thats well said matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then just a real quick one what was the ppp contribution to net interest income this quarter or what was the allin ppp yield this quarter glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so the allin the contribution was somewhere around million and the allin yield is probably around million and you got to be careful with that because thats not a full quarter yield right matt breese q analyst stephens inc understood what would it be on a full quarter glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so its probably closer to like a so if you think about this if you think about i said our average balance of a ppp loan is about the allin yields would be about million funding cost about million so youd be around million webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 matt breese q analyst stephens inc thank you okay thats all i had appreciate it john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks matt appreciate it operator thank you at this time i would like to turn
