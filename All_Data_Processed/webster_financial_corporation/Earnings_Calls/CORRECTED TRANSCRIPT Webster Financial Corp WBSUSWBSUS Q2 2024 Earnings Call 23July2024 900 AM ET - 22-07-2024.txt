credit joint venture with marathon asset management the hiring of neal holland as our next chief financial officer and the addition of bill haas to our board of directors the marathon joint venture is

think youll share my enthusiasm as each of you have opportunities to engage with him following glenns transition in early august webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 bill haas who joined websters board of directors last week is also a great addition to the company bill is coming off a 38year career at the occ where he was deputy comptroller for midsize bank supervision his extensive regulatory and risk management background will be tremendous asset to our board of directors in combination these additions illustrate our commitment to investing in the people and processes that will advance the capabilities of our company as we grow and create longterm franchise value for stakeholders ill now turn to our financial performance for the quarter beginning on slide on an adjusted basis for the quarter we generated a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of our adjusted eps was our efficiency ratio was we were pleased to grow core deposits by million and use a significant portion of the funds to redeem wholesale funding loans grew by million or just under with growth anticipated to continue in the back half of the year on slide we recap our unique deposit funding profile where i specifically want to highlight encouraging developments at hsa bank and ametros at hsa bank investments we have made to enhance our technology via the bend acquisition two years ago are bearing fruit we advanced our digital experience which led to some significant client wins during selling season this spring and bodes well for our deposit balances next year these investments in technology also provide flexibility to improve our solutions in the third quarter we will launch a new investment offering which provides discrete opportunity to add roughly million in deposits in the quarter we also extended our longterm relationship with cigna our largest hsa partner relationship ametros continues to produce the robust deposit growth we anticipated when we announced the acquisition at the end of last year additionally we will begin offering webster banking products to ametros member base in the third quarter this opportunity was not anticipated in our original projections for ametros and strengthens the strategic rationale for the acquisition in addition to the value proposition for ametros member base on slide we provide an updated overview of our commercial real estate portfolio focusing on the two portfolios that are capturing most of the headlines there were no significant changes to the performance characteristics of our rent regulated multifamily portfolio where our concertedly underwritten portfolios performance has held up really well as you can see by consistently low levels of classified and nonaccrual loans the portfolio is granular has conservative ltvs and debt service coverage ratios was underwritten to property cash flows at the time of origination and has limited maturities in the next two years for office we also have a portfolio that is granular with conservative underwriting characteristics as the sector continues to be challenged we did have several loans moved to nonaccrual which was the primary driver of the increase in our overall npls this quarter office balances were million at the end of the second quarter down from just over billion last quarter in our office portfolio approximately of the remaining loan balances have some form of credit enhancement which adds significant value in mitigating potential losses a few important comments to make as it relates to overall credit even with the negative risk rating migration our npl ratio classified loan ratio and annualized chargeoff rate in the quarter all remain proximate to or better than prepandemic webster levels meaning these metrics remain consistent with a more normalized credit environment as we continue to aggressively and proactively manage and review the portfolio absolute material change in the environment or unforeseen surprises we dont see this rate of grade migration continuing in  webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 finally with a reserve coverage our cet sic cet1 capital accreting back to by year end and our strong operating and capital generation capabilities we remain confident in our ability to navigate through whatever this credit cycle throws at us with that ill turn it over to glenn to cover our financials in more detail glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap and adjusted earnings for the second quarter we reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with diluted earnings per share of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million and diluted eps of the adjustment was a pretax million charge as a result of repositioning of our securities portfolio next ill review balance sheet trends beginning on slide total assets were billion at period end up nearly million from the first quarter our security balances were up million relative to the first quarter the yield on the portfolio increased basis points linked quarter to in the quarter we sold securities with a book value of million and reinvested with a nearly 400basispoint improvement in yield the new securities had a duration of years and we anticipate an earnback of less than years the restructuring contributed basis points of the portfolio improvement we expect it will add another basis points in the third quarter as yields will fully reflect the restructuring that occurred midway through the second quarter reinvestment of cash flows and portfolio growth made up the balance of the improvement in yields for the quarter its notable that we manage our securities restructuring such that did not meaningfully impact our capital ratios loans increased million or over the linked quarter with the majority of the growth driven by commercial categories total deposits were up billion with growth driven by interlink ametros and consumer banking offset by a seasonal decline in public funds loantodeposit ratio was in the range of where we expect to operate over the next few quarters borrowings decreased billion as we replaced borrowings with core deposits from interlink capital levels improved modestly the common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was tangible book value increased to per common share with the increase from the prior quarter driven by retained earnings offset by a small increase in aoci in a steady interest rate environment we anticipate million of unrealized security losses would accrete back into capital annually loan trends are highlighted on slide in total loans were up million or linked quarter growth was driven by commercial real estate and ci as we said on our last earnings call we would not expect significant growth in the cre portfolio beyond this quarter the yield on the loan portfolio was flat as we continue to see mixed shift toward categories with lower credit spreads floating and periodic loans were of total loans at quarter end we provide additional detail on deposits on slide we grew total deposits billion with growth driven by interlink consumer banking and ametros when combined transactional and low cost long duration healthcare financial services deposits comprise of our deposit base our dda balances were down million relative to the prior quarter as migration to higher cost deposit categories is slowing webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 our total deposit cost was up basis points over the prior quarter to basis points for the month of june the deposit cost was basis points the increases were the result of clients opting for higher yielding products renewals in our cd portfolio and the utilization of interlink to replace wholesale borrowings our total cost of funds was up a less significant basis points and our cumulative cycle to date total deposit beta is now on slide we illustrate our funding data assumptions on the lefthand side weve updated our deposit beta assumption to incorporate the third quarter during which we expect our cycle to date beta to hold steady at price competition for deposit has slowed and over the course of the second quarter we successfully piloted small decreases in pricing of certain products additionally we have repriced substantially all our cd portfolio in the past year and renewals are now pricing below legacy rates these factors plus the hsa deposit opportunity john mentioned in his remarks will contribute to a slower pace of deposit rate increases weve also show our funding beta on the righthand side which is a better illustration of the power of our unique deposit profile while our utilization of interlink as a source of liquidity results in a higher deposit beta in conjunction with our other deposit products it lowers total funding costs and enhances offbeat balance sheet liquidity as you can see this advantage by looking at our allin funding cost over the last months compared to peer and industry trends moving to slide we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for the prior period net interest income was up million from prior quarter driven by balance sheet growth and higher earning asset yields partially offset by higher funding costs adjusted noninterest income was down million driven by lower boli income and lower deposit in customer hedging activity adjusted expenses were up million and the provision increased million excluding adjustments our tax rate was this quarter up from in the first quarter overall adjusted net income was down million relative to the prior quarter and our efficiency ratio was on slide we highlight net interest income which increased million or linked quarter driven by balance sheet growth and the repositioning of our securities portfolio the net interest margin was down basis points to basis points as a result of increased funding costs which were partially offset by higher asset yields our yield on earning assets increased basis points over prior quarter with loan yields flat and the securities portfolio up basis points deposit costs were up basis points as we utilize interlink to reduce our wholesale borrowings as i previously mentioned we expect the underlying pace of deposit repricing to continue to moderate total liability costs were up basis points relative to a 12basispoint increase in the last quarter on slide is noninterest income which was down million versus prior quarter on an adjusted basis there were a number of components driving the decline including million in lower hsa fees driven by seasonal trends and account fees and a million lower benefit from cva adjustments whose valuation was unchanged this quarter noninterest expenses on slide reported adjusted expenses of million up million from the prior quarter million of the increase came from a full quarter of ametros operating expense and intangibles and the remaining increase related to investments in technology and increased deposit insurance cost slide detailed components of our allowance for credit losses which was up relative to prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we recorded a million provision of which million was primarily due to credit factors and million due to loan growth as a result our allowance coverage for loans increased to basis points from basis points last quarter i would also note we increased reserves in the traditional office portfolio by million in the quarter webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets increased million relative to the prior quarter with nonperforming loans now representing basis points of total loans as john indicated earlier the increase in npls was related to four office credits commercial classified loans as a percent of commercial loans increased to basis points from basis points as classified loans increased by million on an absolute basis classified loan increase was concentrated in healthcare and office net charge offs on the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis down modestly from last quarters level on slide we maintain strong capital levels our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was our tangible book value was a share ill wrap up my comments on slide with our outlook for we expect loans to grow by to for the full year with growth for the remainder of the year driven by ci categories were anticipating deposit growth in the range with growth in diverse products we now expect net interest income in the range of billion234 billion on a nonfte basis which will effectively leave us flat on a year overyearbasis for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis the fte adjustment is now expected to be roughly million from million previously our net interest income outlook assumes one cut fed funds rate in december adjusted noninterest income will be roughly million at the lower end of our prior range adjusted expenses continue to be in the range of billion to billion our efficiency ratio is expected to be in the mid range we expect an effective tax rate of and we remain prudent managers of capital our nearterm common equity tier ratio target is which we anticipate will achieve by year end and as you can see our longterm target continues to be with that ill turn it back to john for closing remarks john r ciulla chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn i want to make one final point on outlook while on an absolute basis our net interest income performance has been relatively solid with respect to industry trends with nii increasing over the last quarter it obviously has not been as robust as we anticipated earlier in the year our sponsor business has not grown as anticipated due to slower private equity activity and competition from the private credit markets and the absolute level of loan repricings and refinancings in a higherforlonger environment have been lower than anticipated which has had the collective impact of muting loan yields i want to stress that weve taken steps to stress the downside risks in our revised outlook to position us well to deliver results within the new range by the end of i want to take a moment to recognize glenns outstanding years at webster hes been my partner in providing steadfast execution and a ton of value as we have grown the bank and navigated through some unique operating environments and a transformational moe consistent with a strong commitment to webster glenn has agreed to remain an advisor to the company for a period of time on behalf of our board and our leadership team i want to wish glenn all the best in his next chapter we remain confident about websters prospects and longterm franchise opportunities as we continue to build and invest in our organizations capabilities and people our return profile and balance sheet strength provide us with great opportunities to invest in our company and better serve our clients helping to ensure we remain in a webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 position of strength with returns at the top of our peer group a betterthanpeer efficiency ratio strong level of absolute net interest margin and a relatively favorable deposit and funding cost profile thank you to all of you for joining us today operator glenn and i will open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions well take our first question from matthew breese at stephens inc matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp indiscernible matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning i was hoping you could give us some idea for the margin as we head into year end with some rate cuts and into you know obviously the balance sheet is a bit more industry neutral there was a securities restructuring and then theres still fixed asset repricing so i was just looking for some frame of reference of where we might see the nim migrate to over the next couple of quarters and into glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure and so as i sort of indicated in our comments and john sort of touched on as well well get the benefit of fixed asset repricing going forward loan growth as well as the securities repositioning and some of that will be offset by what we think is going to be more modest deposit repricing and i can go deeper on that as far as what we see but all that combined that i think were at million i think youd probably expect us to exit the year somewhere around the mid on a nim basis matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay great and then john maybe you could touch on the commercial real estate npl pickup you know first of all you mentioned it was a handful loans maybe a couple of loans you know how many were in there size and then just some idea on resolution and expected loss content would be great john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp sure happy to matt so yeah the credit story obviously the headline here looks negative and because we had negative risk rating migration but it really was sort of unique to a couple of discrete portfolios mainly in the office portfolio and cre which as you know is million our npls in commercial went up million i believe and that was the result almost entirely for office loans so you get a sense again of the granularity not huge single webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 point exposures and so the rest of the entire loan portfolio is sort of behaved as you would normally kind of slowly migrate into normalized credit with respect to loss content its awful hard i mean what i would tell you is when were looking at npls obviously we do a deep dive we get updated appraisals and so all of that is kind of factored into cecl and so what i would say is in our coverage ratio we believe that obviously we have adequate reserves for any expected losses id also tell you it wasnt just a throwaway comment that three quarters of our office loans have some sort of credit enhancement which doesnt really factor into the probability of default risk rating but factors in our minds into loss given default so things like debt service reserves additional completion guarantees extended guarantees from the sponsor and maybe bootstrap collateral from other property types we think all will help mitigate losses so again we dont see loss content really impacting we still look at our projected annualized chargeoff rate in that 25basispoint to 30basispoint range obviously as we always qualify we say that in commercial lending you could have a bigger quarter and a smaller quarter but kind of as a run rate we still think our losses are not going to change as we move forward were well reserved and again were encouraged by the fact that everything you see from a credit perspective really in this quarter is a result of what happened in our office portfolio and a bit in ci and ill just anticipate the next question in kind of our healthcare related and healthcare services portfolio which is also under billion but as you probably know industrywide thats been a little bit challenged for things like labor availability wage inflation higher input costs and slower reimbursement rates so again were encouraged by the fact that its not a portfoliowide deterioration but really in two discrete portfolios that are relatively small and we think we have a good handle on matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great ill leave it there thanks for taking my questions operator well move next to chris mcgratty at kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hello good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc john or glenn im getting a few questions on the updated nii guide i think in your prepared remarks you said just high confidence this is the last cut could you elaborate i guess on what would make it either conservative or a little bit aggressive at this point webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah chris thats indiscernible the dynamic here theres been a lot around as i referenced in my comments a lot around loan yields and obviously deposit costs have gone up modestly we still have compared to industry favorable deposit costs and favorable funding costs when you look at the peer group or the broader industry and what we missed quite frankly was number one our kind of gem of sponsor specialty having higher yields at what we believe to be all day long a better risk adjusted return has really not grown significantly weve had a lot of churn in the portfolio decent originations but losing the yield on hundreds of millions of dollars of anticipated sponsor and changing the mix of loan growth and having overall lower loan growth obviously hurt yields theres also the dynamic of refinancings and repricings which have slowed significantly to our original expectations and kind of perversely we believe that once the fed starts cutting that while our repricing down on existing floating rate loans well obviously provide some sort of headwind we also think that a lot of the repricing and refinancings will actually improve the loan yields as we move forward so i guess if you were to ask me whether its aggressive or conservative what i would tell you is i think its right in our model the range weve obviously adjusted down our expectations of the benefit of repricing and refinancings we do anticipate a stronger second half in sponsor but were not relying on a spring back we have a higher pipeline and we are seeing significantly more activity there but we dont know what will happen with respect to churn in the portfolio so i think its our best case and so if we get a more normalized origination channel and sponsor and we get some pickup in refinancing activities and as glenn can talk about more with respect to pricing we have cds rolling off at higher levels than new cds are coming on we get some moderation we could outperform the guide what could have us underperform the guide is not being able to hit our what we believe to be reasonable and modest loan growth targets and a continued mix towards lower yielding assets and so this has been a unique environment for us with an inverted yield curve we missed the mark on the guidance obviously and were not pleased with it it doesnt make us happy weve tried to pressure test where we are but we think the guidance range weve given is neither conservative nor aggressive its kind of right in the middle of our updated assumptions based on the trends and the knowledge we know now glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah and if i can john just to add a little bit more on the funding side of it right so we did see the deposit cost go up basis points and part of that was driven by lower average dda balances i would say thats probably about basis points as john mentioned i mean during the quarter we had about billion in cds that matured and then matured at million and repriced at million that reverses itself as we get into the third quarter where we have about billion in maturing cds with a weighted average rate of and though weve repriced down to so thatll be positive and will support the nim going forward and then the other thing i would say is that the dda migration we saw a million decline in the first quarter its down to million about half of that million is public funds which come back in in the third quarter and so that we do think giving those dynamics that both our deposit costs and our funding costs should moderate going forward webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great and john if i could on capital you said by the end of the year over time how does that play out for does that mean growth do you expect growth to pick up and use capital that way would you flip on the buyback john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp well i think in our just given our profitability we should be at organically by the end of this year and then i think looking at the operating environment the expectation are that things are more normalized that weve got good line of sight that any credit migration has moderated we feel comfortable about where we are i think we go back chris to kind of our general stated capital management program which is if we have opportunities to grow our balance sheet organically in good returning assets well obviously accelerate that if we have an opportunity to continue to broaden like in ametros tuckin or do something from an acquisition perspective we would if not we would absolutely turn back on the buyback and look at the dividend as well so kind of thats the order of magnitude and right now in our base case our expectation is that once we crests year end were going to have good line of sight and visibility to where we are well get hopefully some certainty around the path of rates from the fed and well be back to managing our capital with that longer term in insight but were not going to do that before we feel very comfortable that weve got a not volatile macro environment christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator well take our next question from mark fitzgibbon at piper sandler mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning mark glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp good morning mark webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co i noticed the average rate on the interlink deposits this quarter was i think can you help us understand the thinking around adding sort of billion this quarter in interlink deposits do you expect those to reprice down or any color you could give would be great glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah those are basically tied to fed funds and its claimdriven and so it depends on the new originations of that but absolutely as we look at the fed making any kind of move interlink is one that would reprice down because its indexed to fed funds so as the fed begins to move those would reprice down mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a follow up and im sorry if i missed this earlier but did you mention the million uptick in commercial nonmortgage 30day 89day delinquencies what was that john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah it was a single credit mark and it was actually at the strong rated credit that just administratively didnt get fixed and rolled over by quarter end and it was cured the first week in july so that went away and theres no credit issue associated with that spike up in delinquency mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator next well go to steven alexopoulos at jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i want to start to go back to the nii outlook for mid and indiscernible i know you said you stressed it but if we get two cuts with the first cut in september and then another in december does that bring you to the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 low end of the new range or does that bring you below the range and then glenn in response to matts question you said the mid exit nim but i dont what if we get two cuts what does the exit number look like then glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so just on the first question let me take it because if you looked at our funding and our total balance sheet so as i said in the past ph weve got billion in deposits about of that i would characterize as high data products thats where you ph fund it into like some government banking things like that that reprice pretty quickly so the 25basis point reduction you would expect that to come down so take billion probably youll get around say million a quarter in benefit now the flip side is that we have about billion in floating rate loans that would also reprice so that would be a net drag if you take those down basis points and then offsetting that are further declines in like the normal cd or the normal retail deposits that are eventually drift down and then we get the benefit of we put on hedges thats probably beneficial to the tune of like million a quarter once the fed reduces by basis points so if you put all that together its probably a net positive on a small basis so indiscernible think about million million in a quarter right if the fed were to go in september so its basically neutralized in fact if you look at our slide deck on page you can see that weve done a lot of work to sort of neutralize the balance sheet and thats so were well positioned i think for reductions the second half of your question i think on i think it was on nim steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc exit nim glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp exit yeah and so that again i think it would be driven by the same sort of factors and you would expect that still the puts and takes to that still youd get the benefit of the hedges you get the benefit of the of deposits repricing immediately partially offset by the floating rate loans that reset and so youd probably still be in that mid330 range on a nim basis john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp so steve rates fee at the high level just to repeat for the sake of repeating you know when we did the merger we significantly reduced asset sensitivity naturally in terms of the entire makeup of the balance sheet and then with extending duration in the securities portfolio the hedges we put on and the dynamics were significantly less asset sensitive than we were kind of last heading into the last rate cut cycle so thats sort of the first premise and then when you look at to glenns point when we look at the difference between no cuts a september cut september and a december cut the actual quarterly impact is relatively modest just given all the inputs and outputs of the immediately pricing down deposits the immediately lowering yield in the loan portfolio and then the hedging and the other dynamics that we have in our balance sheet so we dont see that as either a big tailwind or a big headwind as we look at the second half of the year webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thats actually great color if i could ask on the loan outlook because john i know you said that that was one of the drivers of why nii has been reduced if i look at the midpoint of the new guide it implies around billion of loan growth at youre at million at the midpoint that implies about million in the second half to get to the guide quite a few banks who have weaker loan growth than you in the first half are guiding to an uptick in the second half why are you guys not expecting a bit of an uptick or at least continuation in the second half particularly if we get those cuts maybe it percolates loan demand a bit john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp you know its a good question right youve been covering us for a long time and i bragged about high single digit commercial loan growth year in and year out and over the last years weve done that with the exception of march madness last year and the pandemic right and so i get it and i think one of the aspects and elements obviously is that were deemphasizing cre originations so that has an impact but i agree with you in the build and thats why we still think that to loan growth for the full year is attainable the most granularity i can give you is were up yeartodate in loan growth on a stated basis thats loan growth in the first half if you adjust for the fact that we took commercial services and factoring and put it into loans held for sale so i do have some confidence that we can do another loan growth in the second half of the year and i think if you ask me for kind of the geography of that growth we are turning on and we have already started generating some mortgage growth and we think that nows the time that we can do that given our balance sheet so thatll be a contributor obviously sponsor we think well have a better second half than first half weve got public sector finance which has a pretty good pipeline we have fund banking which although outstandings can be a little fluctuating you know we continue to have really good sponsor relationships and the ability to do that lender finance our traditional middle market our business banking our assetbased lending we still have a whole bunch of levers that were pulling on and we do think that the second half our gut tells us will be a more robust loan growth environment for the industry but i think given what weve done in terms of missing peoples expectations on nii were not going to overpromise and so i think that our to seems to be grounded in reality and it seems to be grounded in where we think we have confidence to get there could there be some upside in the second half particularly with the fed cutting and maybe with what happens in november and the election and people have a little bit more confidence sure and i think that well position ourselves and were ready offensively low loan to deposit ratio lots of deposits and liquidity well be able to take advantage of it so i think our loan growth of in the second half of the year is our base case best estimate if it gets more difficult well scrounge our way to get there is there an opportunity to maybe outperform that number in the second half given macro conditions sure steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay if i could just wrap glenn thanks for all the years of providing really great color on the calls you know when i think back years ago till today i mean theres no comparison of the company today and you leave webster a big shoes to fill so thanks thank webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 indiscernible glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thank you steve appreciate it thank you operator well go next to jared shaw at barclays capital jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning thanks and id just like to reiterate my congratulations glenn its been great working with you and good luck with the next step glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc and maybe just looking at credit and the reserves and just looking at slide with the million provision tied to macro and credit you know during the quarter i guess the moodys base case improved is that then just all sort of due to credit migration within the portfolio or are you using a different weighting on some of the moodys scenarios glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah no so million provision as i mentioned does include about million of incremental reserve for the office portfolio but i would say the remainder of that so say million are increase in reserves it was a result of credit risk migration in the quarter so moodys as a whole from a macro standpoint was basically neutral quarteroverquarter so most of that was driven by the risk rating migration jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay all right thanks and then weve been getting lot of questions this past week on what some other banks are paying on their sweep accounts and people are trying to see how that impacts or how hsa could be impacted by that could you just give an update on how confident you are with the hsa structure in terms of not being caught up in this sweep account discussion and just confirm that this is not sort of an indiscernible type of a product for us john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah theres nothing right now that would suggest and i think we take a pretty standard approach that were a nationally regulated financial institution not in the business of providing fiduciary services or investment advice and so obviously weve been on top of it working with the hsa team and our legislative team we do not see that we would be subject to those new rules webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you very much john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator well move next to manan gosalia at morgan stanley manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to ask on the expense side you kept the expense guide unchanged while cutting the nii guide so do you see any potential offsets on the expense side as revenues remain under pressure here john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i mean i think that where we are is as we think about investing in the business we think about investment in risk and our march to category four we dont see any nearterm pressures on hitting our guidance on expenses i think weve been conservative in sort of keeping that expense base to make sure that we can continue to invest in the company i always remind people that were starting from a mid efficiency ratio which is percentage points below our peer group do we have opportunities as things shift in terms of our capital allocation to different business lines do we have opportunities to make organizational efficiencies we do were examining those but we thought it was premature to cut our expense guidance at this time obviously as prudent managers we need to do things to we promised marketleading returns over time as theres pressure on revenues we need to make sure we rightsize our expenses i do think we have some opportunities but at this juncture given the makeup and given where we are and the opportunities we see in front of us were sticking with our initial guidance and well do everything we can to bring that in at the low end of the guidance glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah and i would just keep in mind given our guidance if you look at it on either side the low end or the high end its about million say of an increase and of that increase about half of that is on the ametros platform so its the operating expense and the intangibles associated with ametros and then the other two pieces are basically performancebased compensation and investments that weve made in the business whether its hsa or in the commercial business or in the operation side so thats the broadbrush of what the increase is and i would just point to that investment in ametros as you can see on the numbers and the financials just beginning to pay off already manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then separately can you talk about whats driving the decisioning for securities repositioning you know so you are locking in higher rates ahead of rate cut so youre taking advantage of the lower markto market indiscernible capital accretion from each quarter so just talk about whats driving the webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 decisioning and what duration youre putting on on the securities book and if you have room to do more on the repositioning side thanks john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah glenn will give you some of the financial details but i think you just hit on the number of factors so basically one of our primary objectives is to accrete capital back to on cet1 so i would say that what has been driving us to opportunistically look at balance sheet repositioning has been the desire for capital neutrality the looking at the earnback period and youll see that the moves weve made thus far this year have been really short payback periods and so that all factors in and well look obviously we have no plans to do anything right now but well continue to look opportunistically based on all of those metrics the impact to earnings the impact to capital and the earn back period on the move glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah the only thing i would add is yeartodate weve done about billion in restructuring and so the biggest piece was in the second quarter but as i indicated in my comments were picking up about basis points on yield and the duration is ph staying around years so that helps our asset sensitivity as well but i dont think that once we start looking at other tranches the earnback continues to increase so its something were monitoring and we do a pretty thorough job and just looking at the securities portfolio continuously but i dont think that youd expect to see another billion or billion in the immediate near term manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you and all the very best glenn glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thank you john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator well take our next question from casey haire at jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning casey webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc so wanted to touch on the fixed rate asset repricing in the loan yield so it sounds like you guys are stepping away from cre here and are going to be doing more sponsor finance and just wondering the new money yields in the second quarter versus new money yields whats in the pipeline currently john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yes so let me just if i can casey let me just talk about the yield quarteroverquarter theres been some questions about that and so versus and as i look at that like theres headwinds and tailwinds on that and so i think part of the decline quarteroverquarter was lower loan marks and that was worth about basis point and then we did more commercial services up to held for sale that was also a drag of basis point the hedging cost on the cre portfolio was worth another basis point and so those are sort of the big things and then a higher mix to cre and public sector finance so you have that headwind going against you and then part of what weve seen going the other way are we are seeing like the sponsor specialty book up basis points middlemarket up basis points fund banking up basis points so on a weighted basis that cost back about basis points so thats the dynamics of the net down in basis point quarteroverquarter so for the second quarter our total origination coupon rate was like and i think thats fairly consistent with where we were in the first quarter as well glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp okay so just to give you like a little market cut so our originations in the second quarter with respect to sponsor being down as well and we had some fund banking growth a little bit of ph cre growth public sector finance growth you know youre looking at sofr plus mid on some of those deals where sponsors were sofr plus to sofr plus and so the origination yield mix had a significant impact we do see more activity and i would qualify your comment its not like were overemphasizing sponsor i think were growing all of our other asset classes but the expectation is that well have more normalized sponsor growth which has a positive impact on overall loan yields casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just the so the cre concentration last quarter you guys talked about a goal of getting that working that down over the next four to six quarters you also seemed open to divesting of some cre just wondering what is the current thinking on reducing the cre concentration and do you get there organically and indiscernible john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its a great point i think there will be more than just organic there will be opportunities i have nothing to sort of announce on this call but if you think about some of the things were working on we have agency eligible loans that we can securitize weve got interest in continued loan sales particularly on floating rate highquality loans where they may not be strategic deposits alongside of it so you can rest assured that all of the potential opportunities to potentially have step function reductions and by the way provide us with more opportunity to webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 continue to support our existing great relationships with cre folks because were certainly not out of that business but there are ways where we can moderate and keep flat our growth as we accrete capital and grow the other loan categories so i would say that youll hear us in the next several calls telling you about opportunities that have been kind of neutral to earnings obviously were losing earning assets but in terms of not selling at discounts we have opportunities to make good economic decisions as we grow other asset categories and free up opportunities to grow really good cre with strong relationships and deposits youll hear us talk about some of the moves that well make to accelerate and move away from just organic flattening of that portfolio but yeah i think were still on track to get into that 250ish range in the next three to four quarters i think i said last quarter four to six quarters so whatever that is now three to five quarters we still think we can get to million and then we have to talk about and decide as we move forward the makeup of the balance sheet our origination and distribution capabilities because weve got some really good capital markets people and cre as well so that as we kind of march over the next three years closer to category four whether that and how we get that exposure even lower between and operator well go next to daniel tamayo at raymond james daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you good morning everybody john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning dan daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just a quick question on the office portfolio and the migration that we had in the quarter just curious if there was kind of put maybe you could connect dots in between those four loans if there was anything that they had in common i appreciate the data that you have on the new york city exposure which looks like that was part of it but curious just locationwise sizewise anything else you can talk about of those properties that maybe connected relative to the rest of the office portfolio john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah actually there were no geographic connectivity three were in our kind of branch footprint one was outside of our branch footprint with a inmarket sponsor i would say the things they have in common stress on rents and noi and lower appraisals and so thats what drove that migration so i would say nothing related to specific underwriting team or specific pressure in one geography its the overall pressure on office and rents occupancy and value daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 okay great and then you mentioned you dont expect risk migration to continue at this pace what gives you confidence when you say that particularly i guess in the office book that as maturities continue to indiscernible that we might not continue to see loans deteriorate there in a meaningful way john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah daniel thats a really good question and as a former chief credit risk officer i always hate to kind of forecast credit performance and thats why i qualified the statement by saying assuming that the macro conditions stay the same and we dont get any big surprises i think what gives us general confidence is and weve talked about this before jason and his team have continued to do quarterly deep dives into those portfolios that evidence the most stress i mentioned earlier that we still have really concentration in credit pressure in the million office portfolio the rest of cre is actually performing really well and performing actually at a better rate than overall ci which youve heard other people mention on calls as well and then within ci we sort of have this little pocket of healthcare services which is also under billion a little bit in food and restaurant which is a relatively small portfolio but couple of pockets of concentration and so with these deep dives across the portfolio and with our what i believe to be proactive and conservative risk rating biases we dont see if were going through our problem asset reports as were looking at things kind of significant deterioration outside of those pockets and my hope is that our team has captured the current risk profile in those two portfolios so thats why when we look as we do ph do roll rates and we look forward we certainly dont see similar migration in  daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thanks for the color john appreciate it john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp you got it anytime operator well go next to bernard vongizycki at deutsche bank bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey guys good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so john you noted the partnership with marathon will provide more capabilities for clients and allow webster to participate and ph figure loan deals that you wouldnt have been able to do so otherwise due to size limits im just wondering will you be expanding the credit box to participate in deals how does underwriting standard the marathon compares to the credit culture at webster webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah well the only thing i will say and obviously we actually after the announcement we just signed the jv we plan on everything going live towards the end of the fourth quarter maybe the beginning of the first quarter and so im not going to comment indiscernible details but i certainly can answer your question it should have no impact functionally on how we operate how we originate loans how we gotomarket with our sponsors it does give us more balance sheet flexibility and it does give us the ability to continue to move up market and keep our bank balance sheet hold levels similar but also be able to do larger transactions because there is a natural partner to be able to warehouse and hold the higher portions of the bigger loans and so i think the key message for us to you is that its not going to change the risk profile of the bank it doesnt dilute or change our focus on what were doing for the banks balance sheet or the banks earnings profile it just gives us more flexibility optionality and basically a larger overall balance sheet if you will to be able to fund larger loans bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just following up i know earlier in the call you did mention some of the pressure in sponsor was related just to the increased competition from private credit obviously indiscernible the jv just any comments anything you can elaborate on what youve been seeing with that increased competition specifically and the impact on sponsor john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp sure and i dont think this is a secret to anyone right we have seen the proliferation of private credit impact weve been in this business as you know for a long time and even going back years many of our primary competitors were bdcs finance companies sort of private credit as defined years ago obviously now theres trillion in private credit out there and so what youve seen the impact on banks overall has been on capital markets fees underwriting and syndication because private credit extends the leverage profile on loans they hold larger pieces of loans than are prudent for bank balance sheets to hold and i would say since march madness of last year theres been an acceleration the key for me to talk about is that it doesnt render us noncompetitive many private equity firms and many of the ones that we deal with in sectors we know well prefer to deal with banks theres a different relationship style theres different management process when things go sideways theres the full capabilities of a bank with respect to swaps and fx and cash management and treasury products but it has had an impact on spreads and it has had an impact on sort of the number of swings we get at the plate and so but i do think that for the first two quarters this year its been more activitybased than competitive based thats muted growth in that area so i do think with some of the tools that were building we can remain very competitive with our existing sponsors and continue to grow that business but there is no doubt that private credit has become more relevant in the financing space and i know its impacting the entire industry bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for the color and thanks for taking my questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 operator well go next to timur braziler at wells fargo securities timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc circling back to the office discussion im just wondering what drove the updated appraisals this quarter were the loans coming up for maturity or was there something else and then maybe just provide an update for the remainder of the book what portion has recent appraisals on it john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp i didnt catch the last part but ill ask you for that again you know the first part is just the general normal processes either risk rating migration certain levels of debt service or approaching maturity that we will order appraisals and then take into consideration the entire value of property noi debt service coverage in terms of making a risk rating determination on accrual or nonaccrual so thats a standard operating procedure what was the second part of that question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc just what portion of the office book now has updated appraisals on it john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp id say maybe timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then second indiscernible john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp thats a swag by the way but i think thats probably pretty close to accurate timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 okay i appreciate that and then just on the hsa business the migration from deposits to investments seems to be accelerating maybe here a little bit can you just talk through that dynamic and just remind us how you monetize the investment component of hsa john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp sure obviously in a higher rate environment as well we have seen migration we always remind folks that if you look at the dynamics of the various spenders savers and investors that investors still have significantly higher average deposit balances than spenders so as people continue to invest while that takes some deposits away from us that the underlying deposit base of those investors is still very very strong and profitable we make significantly more money particularly in this rate environment on a deposit than we do on an investment we have taken steps and i mentioned in my comments to continue to have investment offerings that are not only and most importantly better experiences for our clients but also that give us slightly more economics so were moving in the right direction but at the end of the day we make a fraction of what we make on deposits based on the value of deposits now than we do on a dollar of investment glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah the only thing i would add timur is that our business like million accounts about million or id say are still spenders so they have an average balance of ph right so and then if you go to the saver profile they have an average balance of about and then the investors are only of our account so and thats up to your point very good point from a year ago but they still maintain an average balance of like and they have a investment balance so we still get the benefit of the funding advantage on our balance sheet i think the opportunity for us is obviously to educate the spenders on the benefits of savings the triple taxfree nature of it such that they become more savers and so thats and i know thats something that chad and his team always have been focused on timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks operator well go next to laurie hunsicker at seaport research partners john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp good morning laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah hi good morning good morning glenn i just want to say congrats and best wishes so my question is really sort of multipronged around commercial credit not to beat a dead horse here but just want to understand the million loan loss provision less the million growth so down to million how much of that specifically was office how much of that was also your webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc sponsor specialty and then i know you mentioned that the office reserves grew by million what is your specific office reserve now glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so let me take it one at a time and john can jump in here so of the million as i indicated in the comments about million is office right of that million and i think on the sponsor book i dont have the absolute dollar number but i know our coverage ratio was up john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp its glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah exact im sorry indiscernible add to that laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc okay so but just million was office and you said obviously you had credit risk migration so thats only million of your million in loan loss provision was related to office is that correct glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thats correct john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp yes laurie if you think about it we already had ratings on those nonaccruals were likely in substandard already or had specific reserves against them so at the end of the day thats the incremental reserve amount for the quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 perfect perfect okay and your sponsor specialty book what are the nonperformers there now and then just one last followup on chargeoffs the million that were commercial how much of that was office and then or even if you have the split between cre and ci obviously how much was office and then also how much was the sponsor specialty john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp can you repeat that question laurie glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp the second question laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc sure yeah of your charge offs of million in it was mainly all commercial million in chargeoffs just looking for the split between cre and ci and then just also specifically what were your office chargeoffs and what were your sponsor specialty chargeoffs and i mean just the sponsor specialty nonperforming number that i had from last quarter was million just want to make sure i have a refresh there thanks so much john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp so we had total chargeoffs in the quarter of million million of that were proactive loan sales mostly in cre and so of the actual kind of liquidating chargeoffs normal course chargeoffs we basically had a traditional office loan we had a loss in abl and a small loan in sponsor of million so thats the makeup of the chargeoffs which were actually down from last quarter operator well move next to samuel vargas sic varga at ubs samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning just wanted to go back to the loan and deposit guide for a second on the loan growth i appreciate all the color youve provided so far this morning can you just i guess name sort of some of the categories that youre most confident in for the second half of the year loan growth john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp sure i will and before i do that im actually going to answer lauries last question even though shes not on the phone the npls in sponsor were flat for last quarter so that same number youre looking at laurie and i apologize for you getting cut off there yeah i mean i think we have as i said if you look and i think steve made the comment its somewhere between million and billion in that to range in terms of what we would need to do in the second half of the year theres no one concentrated category but if you think of a few hundred million dollars in mortgage as a start and a contribution a couple of hundred million dollars in lender finance a couple hundred million dollars in webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2024 fund banking a little bit more in traditional middle market ci and then some smaller but material amounts in public sector finance and then contribution from abl and business banking i think thats how we build that so its not either throwing the bomb or putting emphasis on one category its using the portfolio of leverage we have to have kind of diversified and robust loan growth as we said there may be cre will be bounced around maybe flat could be up a little bit depending on the actions we take but itll be a pretty diversified loan growth with maybe the additions from last couple of quarters of some more originations for holding in our residential mortgage but kind of the same categories that have been contributing and hopefully a more robust sponsor quarter samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for that and then just switching over to deposit guide is it fair to look at the deposit guide as a derivative of the loan growth guide and you dont want to put on extra liquidity if youre able to drive more deposits or are those two more of a separate thought process for you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah no i think thats fair it is the pricing anyway and therefore the deposit balances are driven by the funding nature of the loan book so yeah we manage it that way along with broker deposits and wholesale funding as well so those are the dynamics we look at i think as you look at the guide like i said the costs will moderate thats how were thinking about it right now so theres opportunity for us and i think when you look at that second or third page of our deck you can get a sense of the diversification and the levers we can pull to optimize that mix john r ciulla a chairman chief executive officer webster financial corp and interlink is the real lever the other deposits we want right regardless of what loan growth the strength of our franchise is growing core operating deposits so we want hsa to maximize its growth ametros to supercharge its growth and we want all of our middle market and commercial real estate and commercial and business banking activities and our retail bank to continue to grow good relationship deposits at reasonable prices so thats really not a factor of what we see available to us on the asset generation side thats a factor of continuing to grow the value of our deposit franchise but i do think glenns right as it relates to what we look for with respect to interlink growth or other brokerage cds or other things that would be a function of deploying that liquidity for asset growth samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks for the color operator and that
