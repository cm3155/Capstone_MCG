individuals and businesses in need webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 when you turn to slide you can see webster at its very best consistent with the way our values based organization has operated since our founding during the great depression in we immediately took action at the outset of the pandemic to support our employees customers and the communities we serve the safety of our employees was and is our number one priority we swiftly moved of our workforce to remote or at home work thereby creating a safer socially distance work setup in our buildings for those who need to be on site to execute the central operations we modified branch activities and hours to ensure the safety of our employees and customers while being available to meet to our customers needs this included moving to drive through and atm service with bank lobbies open by appointment only we established a no interest loan program for our employees whose families have been financially impacted by the pandemic weve paid all of our employees of pay including those who are home because of illness quarantine higher health risk or to take care of loved ones or kids home because of school closures weve increased the daily pay of those bankers on the frontline and have added pto time to those workers as a future benefit we have not reduced our workforce by a single fte during the crisis and weve augmented and expanded our employee assistance programs to support our employees during the pandemic for our customers just as we lead the banking industry with our foreclosure avoidance program during the great recession we immediately placed a moratorium on residential mortgage foreclosures relating to webster owned mortgages we waived fees on early cd withdrawals we increased the availability and amount of funds for withdrawal by our customers and we work with our customers adversely impacted by covid19 through the modification of loans the deferral of loan payments and through participation in the sba paycheck protection program and the feds main street lending program here are some data points related to activities weve undertaken both as principle and what weve done through government programs as of april 16th we have modified over units representing million of residential mortgages and home equities thats approximately of total home equity and mortgage balances roughly borrowers or million of small business loans representing approximately of our small business portfolio outstandings and over borrowers and close to billion of commercial loans or roughly of the funded commercial loan portfolio with respect to the paycheck protection program we started accepting applications on day and despite technology and process challenges experienced by all banks we were able to help many business clients in need when the sba stopped accepting applications last thursday we had more than sba approved loans representing approximately million most of which should be funded over the next week weve continued to process applications internally and well begin submitting those applications for approval when the sba has additional funding and opens up the process which it looks now like it will be later this week with respect to the feds main street lending program we have worked with our industry organizations and directly with the fed to be prepared to utilize these loan programs to help our larger commercial customers through the crisis and four our communities weve increased the amount of our philanthropy budget and reposition dollars to support those most impacted by the covid19 pandemic weve made more than in donations thus far to feeding america the american red cross and united ways across our footprint to provide urgent basic needs ill now turn to our financial highlights on slide web quarter results continue to demonstrate our ongoing commitment to strong execution on strategic priorities through any and all operating environments preprovision net revenue of million was up modestly from  driven by a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decline in expenses earnings per share were in the quarter compared to in  of and in webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 the prior years first quarter the decline resulted primarily from an increased provision resulting from the adoption of cecl a weakening forward economic outlook and the impact of a significantly lower interest rate environment glenn and i will walk you through the assumptions underlying our cecl process and ultimate provision number our cecl process is strong consistent with the requirements and controls of the accounting process in this quarter that process included the appropriate amount of conservatism and thoughtful judgment to reflect the uncertainty of the environment and the behaviors in our portfolio with respect to onset of the pandemic tangible book value per common share increased from prior year our first quarter return on common equity was and return on tangible common equity was with each reflecting the million reserve build in the quarter a combination of a slight increase in total revenue and a slight decrease in expenses led to improvement in the efficiency ratio which was in  march 31st reported credit metrics remained strong while our forward forecast of economic conditions deteriorated significantly with the onset of the pandemic slide presents loan and deposit trends loan growth was strong as total loans grew and commercial loans grew almost from a year ago or by more than billion strong organic growth increase was augmented by approximately million in revolver drawdowns in the commercial portfolio in march and we saw a reduction in prepayment activity deposits grew yearoveryear driven by the inflow of hsa deposits and public funds and transactional and hsa deposits now represent of total deposits up from a year ago also of note footings at hsa bank increased from a year ago for growth of million during the year turning to slide i will spend a few minutes speaking to each of our three lines of business in commercial banking loans were up nearly linked quarter and from a year ago which includes the aforementioned million in net revolver draws predrilled the yearoveryear growth while sponsor and specialty loan balances which saw the lions share of the revolver draws drove the linked quarter increase prepayments were lower in the quarter partially attributable to lower economic and transaction activity in the second half of the quarter due to the emergence of the pandemic deposits were up smartly some linked quarter and from a year ago largely driven by the depositing of revolver draws into dda normalizing for revolver usage deposits were up approximately in commercial banking in the quarter loan and deposit volumes in the quarter grew over yearoveryear increase to net interest income in commercial banking despite rate pressure expenses were up yearoveryear driven by investment in people and technology commercial banking ppnr was relatively flat yearoveryear while we are appropriately cautious with new underwriting activities i can tell you that we closed meaningful high quality new business in the quarter in segments that are not experiencing a material adverse impact from the pandemic segments such as software and technology infrastructure in fact in early april we closed our largest agency deal on a best efforts basis a million technology infrastructure deal where we held just over of the risk after close turning to slide in hsa bank we are continuing to make great progress we concluded another successful first quarter as we opened new accounts for a total of new accounts opened over the last months in addition we added over new employers in the quarter there was no material impact in the quarter related to the previously reported movement of accounts tied to the decision by two wholesale partners custodial partners to insource account administration and the accounts were up to million while deposits increased to billion the yearend revenue report indicated an overall hsa market that slowed marginally as the market growth rate of accounts was flat and the deposit growth rate declined by percentage points during the year webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 one important point to note is that hsa banks funded account growth rate was in compared to the industry rate of in the first quarter our funded account growth rate was yearoveryear both reflective of our consistently low percentage of unfunded accounts when compared to industry data we had a good start to the year from a sales perspective as we signed several large employers in the quarter we also announced a major partnership with jellyvision that will further enable our customers to make informed and smart healthcare choices we also launched partnerships with blue cross blue shield of michigan and principal financial group these partnerships are all uniquely capable of delivering strong growth especially within the jumbo employer market in addition as you may have seen yesterday we announced that we signed an agreement to acquire state farm banks portfolio of seasoned hsa accounts representing approximately million in deposits we expect to close that transaction in the second quarter or third quarter in response to the pandemic and consistent with all of webster we were able to quickly transition of our hsa staff to work from home in less than three weeks maintaining customer support and continuing to meet service and quality metrics in addition we are working closely to support our customers through the pandemic at a time when our services may be particularly critical including capabilities we have deployed directly or via partnerships such as ehealth hsa fsa store goodrx blink health medical cost advocate and healthcare bluebook we feel with the current legislative and political landscape remains favorable for the hsa industry and the chances of a nearterm medicare for all national healthcare solution are even more remote than they were a year ago our relationship with wex our technology partner and cigna our largest hsa partner has never been stronger i am on page in community banking weve done a tremendous job of keeping our employees and customers safe while continuing to provide the standard of customer service our clients expect total community bank loans grew by year over year with business banking loans leading the way at deposits grew by again led by business banking noninterest income was up as a result of higher mortgage and investment services revenue many more customers have transitioned to selfservice channels as digitally active households crossed in the quarter for the first time and we see that trend continuing given the pandemic as you can imagine our community banking team along with the resources from across the bank are working digitally diligently in executing on the ppp loan program which will help so many of our customers weve been focusing on customer outreach and support and i cant say enough about the way our community bankers including all of those in our banking centers have delivered for our customers and communities during the first quarter and over the last several weeks before i turn over glenn id like to make a couple of comments related to capital management first we are completely focused on internal execution and other than opportunistic hsa transactions bank ma remains a low priority we have a strong capital position enabling us to support our customers and assist in a financial recovery in the country as we announced this morning our board has approved a quarterly dividend of per share also after a modest repurchase of approximately million shares in early  before the onset of the pandemic we do not anticipate repurchasing additional shares until this pandemic is behind us ill now turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 thanks john ill begin with our average balance sheet on slide average loans grew million or linked quarter growth was led primarily by the commercial business a linked quarter increase of million in commercial real estate was the result of strong originations and a reduction in pay offs on a yearoveryear basis our commercial real estate loans grew more than billion commercial loans now represent of total loans compared to in prior year consumer loan performance was driven by a million increase in residential mortgages with some offset in home equity on the deposit side our low cost transactional and hsa deposits have increased more than billion from last year and now represents of total deposits with a combined indiscernible basis points the  seasonal inflow of hsa and government depositsfunded loan growth as well as a million reduction in shortterm borrowings with regard to capital the modest average linked quarter reduction in common equity is reflect of a day cecl adjustment of million and approximately million as a result of share repurchases in the quarter likewise modest reductions in the common equity tier and tangible common equity ratios are also reflective of cecl share repurchases and asset growth we have elected to phase in the cecl impact on regulatory capital which favorably impacts our ratios by to basis points even excluding the phase and in capital treatment our capital ratios would remain very strong and well in excess of regulatory wellcapitalized levels slide summarizes our  income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings net interest income was flat to prior quarter as a million benefit from loan growth was offset by the effect of a lower rate environment this is reflective in our net interest margin which was lower by four basis points versus  basis points due to lower lone yield which was partially offset by basis points from a lower deposit costs and basis points from a lower borrowing costs versus prior year net interest income declined million million of the decline was due to lower market rates with a partial loss set of million from earning asset growth noninterest income increased million linked quarter and million in prior year hsa fee income increased million as a result of account growth and the seasonal increase in interchange in addition our marktomarket on hedging activity increased million which was offset by decline in syndication and client swap revenue the increase in noninterest income from prior year reflects the marktomarket on hedging activity as well as higher mortgage banking revenue reported noninterest expense of million declined modestly linked quarter and grew less than from prior year preprovision net revenue of million increased million from  and decreased million from prior year provision for credit losses for the quarter was million which i will explain in more detail shortly the efficiency ratio improved a from in  reflecting a modest increase in revenue and a slight decrease in noninterest expense and our effective tax rate was compared to in  turning to slide i will review our results of our cecl adoption and the first quarter allowance as we look at the walk the day cecl adoption was million a increase in the allowance resulting in a starting coverage ratio of during the quarter we had million in net charge offs we rerecorded a million provision as a result of loan growth of million during the quarter loan growth primarily came from the commercial categories and included million in line draws in march slower prepayment activity and loans funded from our strong fourth quarter pipeline the remaining  provision was million bringing our allowance to million or coverage of the provision is reflective of our economic outlook including gdp unemployment and housing prices and a qualitative assessment of our loan portfolio and how it will perform through the pandemic this was accomplished by reviewing higher risk sectors loans participating in modification programs and potential risk rating migration based on a granular bottoms up credit review webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 at the time we closed the books in early april our outlook included a second quarter gdp decline of nearly with unemployment peaking just under and a recovery beginning in the second half of as we move into the second quarter we will refine our assessment in three critical areas first would be an update of our outlook on macroeconomic variables second an updated review of higher risk sectors and a loan modification programs and third the assessment of the impact of government stimulus programs on our portfolio initial april economic forecasts are projected to be more severe as the second quarter gdp decline could exceed with unemployment peaking at all of these areas are still developing making it difficult to project how the pandemic will impact the provision in the second quarter and over the remainder of the year that being said our provision in the second quarter will be driven more heavily by the expected duration and severity of the pandemic slide highlights our key asset quality metrics at march prior to the effects of the current environment non performing loans in the upper left increased million from  ci represented million of the increase net chargeoffs in the upper right increased slightly from  and totaled million in the quarter commercial classified loans in the lower left represented basis points of total commercial loans this compares to a quarter average of basis points the allowance for credit losses increased to million resulting in a coverage ratio of slide highlights our key liquidity metrics our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with a strong competitive advantage more than billion of core deposit growth in  has maintained our favorable loantodeposit ratio of we are predominantly core deposit funded with brokerage tds representing less than of total deposits at march in addition our sources of secured borrowing capacity remained intact totaling over billion at march slide highlights our key capital metrics our regulatory capital ratios exceed wellcapitalized levels by substantial amounts the common equity tier ratio of exceeds wellcapitalized by billion while the access for the tier riskbased capital ratio is million the unprecedented environment makes it difficult to provide formal guidance at this time what i can tell you is we expect average earning assets to grow in the range of over  driven primarily by loan growth we expect net interest income to be flat to  as a result of loan growth paycheck protection program volume and lower deposit in borrowing costs to be somewhat offset by lower asset yields as average market rates have come down since  noninterest income will likely be flat to modestly down given the mark we recognized in  and noninterest expense will likely be flat to q1s level our share count will be about million shares lower on average due to buybacks completed in  with that ill turn things back over to john for a review of our credit profile john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks glenn many of you know that im deeply involved in our credit execution as i grew up in commercial lending and credit and served as websters chief credit risk officer during the financial crisis as i said many times im proud of the credit risk framework that we have built over the last dozen years with respect to risk selection underwriting portfolio management and credit reporting and nearly billion loan portfolio we have today has been thoughtfully and purposefully built well i never predict credit performance the ultimate outcome of which will be determined by the depth and duration of this crisis i cant say that we have been true to our underwriting guidelines and im very proud of our line of business and credit professionals who always put risk management first as i mentioned earlier jason soto our chief credit officer who joined us five years ago from ge capital is with us today on the phone and i will be and he will be available for qa webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 well now walk through the credit slides that we posted this morning with the earnings deck i will respond to any credit question during the general qa starting on slide youll see an outline for this discussion as i mentioned jason and i will comment on our exposure to those segments most directly impacted by the covid pandemic ill then provide what i hope to be a clear and concise comparison of our current loan and securities portfolios with our pregreat recession portfolios and then ill briefly walk through each of our loan portfolios allowing jason to provide some context with key metrics so hopefully youll get a sense to have a clear granular view of the billion we have in loans ill highlight on each slide without reading every detail but i will provide you with what i believe to be the key takeaways slide youve seen this disclosure from other banks as they have reported this attempts to capture our loan outstandings in each of the most impacted sectors including ratings categories modification and line draw activity through which jason will update in a moment i want to make clear we wanted to be transparent with this disclosure but this doesnt represent all of the loans that we think are at risk many of these loans are not at risk these are simply the categories that the industry has been reporting that are obviously most impacted in the first order by the pandemic in fact of these loans are passrated and youll see here that theres been limited modification and revolver draw activity so i want to provide a little context there the key takeaway on this slide is that our direct exposure to these segments is modest on both an absolute and relative basis as i said are in passrated categories most representing or maybe of our total loan portfolio we are fortunate as our strategies have over the longterm been focused on less cyclical industries with recurring cash flows so on a relative basis weve not really pushed hard on sectors like energy transportation discretionary retail as focuses the other point i want to make before letting jason provide some context is that youll see retail in a broadly defined represents of our loan portfolio in this category more than of those loans are in high quality investor cre and those are mostly in non discretionary pharmacy or grocery anchored and for those of you who heard me talk about ph bill rang over years with his retail exposure hes always looking for nondiscretionary ill also tell you that an additional of that retail exposure is fully followed in our abl group where credits are borrowing base secured and often have cash dominion and ive been working with warren mino in that group for the entire years ive been here and they have an unbelievable track record in managing even struggling large retail exposures so weve got a lot of confidence within that pocket of retail jason maybe ill turn it over to you to make a couple of comments there jason soto executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp great thank you john and good morning everyone to provide an update on the information on the slide as of late last week the overall piece of modification requests had slowed the last couple of weeks modifications are up to million versus the million revolver draws in these sectors are up modestly to million versus million that said as john mentioned earlier commercial modifications in total have been roughly billion as of late last week so were clearly seeing modification activity beyond just these sectors reality is that many of the companies being impacted may have a portion of their revenue tied to these sectors or otherwise feeling the ripple effect of the current environment its a bit hard to capture all that with a straight top down approach by sector and so for that reason were using a more granular bottomsup approach to identify the exposure to borrowers that we believe may be more impacted in the current environment by exposure weve webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 reviewed over of the accounts in the portfolio and have reached out to the majority of those where we have direct relationships we created a common framework to rate the potential level of impact to the borrowers and we roll that up weekly and have a call to review updates based on this i believe we have a good handle on the exposure to borrowers that may need some accommodation in the near term i will also say that of the borrowers that have requested modifications are passrated and many have low loan to values ph junior capital owner and sponsor support and liquidity so as soon we start to see a resumption of economic activity throughout were optimistic that the majority of these borrowers will recover and we will certainly do our part to support them in a prudent way john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks jason turning to page these next three slides demonstrate the purposeful strategic shifts in our portfolio since the great recession this is the execution that i talked about earlier the reason i think these three slides are so important is that ive seen so many people use credit performance by asset class during the great recession as a proxy for loss prediction during the next credit downturn like the one we are entering into right now again ill never promise or predict ultimate credit outcomes but i can tell you that our portfolio today is vastly different than what we had in not only are the portfolio dynamics different but the way we underwrite manage and report on risk is light years ahead of where we were in when we had only a few years earlier transitioned to be an occregulated commercial bank the key takeaway on this slide comparing consumer and business banking loan portfolios and performance is that the overwhelming majority of losses here come from broker originated noncentrally underwritten outof market mortgage and home equity loans and from a small portfolio of business banking unsecured loans we no longer originate outofmarket mortgages and home equity loans with few exceptions we centrally underwrite everything internally even correspondent inmarket loans and we have been very disciplined on underwriting guidelines over the last years moreover we have virtually no unsecured business banking loans and we do not originate that product on page it shows the same analysis for our commercial banking portfolios we had outside losses in the discreet residential development portfolio and a discretionary aviation portfolio and equipment finance consistent with my earlier comments we have focused since the great recession on less cyclical verticals and businesses and you can see here that our exposure in those two areas is minimal as a result another key point on this slide is the fact that sponsor specialty and leverage loans within our ci business in general performed at the same level or better than our other portfolios in the commercial bank a point ive made several times over earnings calls when asked about the nature of our leverage loans while our sponsor and leverage loan portfolios are larger today on an absolute basis ill remind you that they represent roughly the same percentage of ci loans as they represented in and they represent roughly the same percentage of tier capital plus reserves that they represented in on page this is a critical slide youve heard me talk about the geography of our capital losses during the great recession here you can see that the single biggest category of losses or writedowns for us during the financial crisis was not in the loan portfolios but in trust preferred securities in our investment portfolio today webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 only of our billion securities portfolio was credit sensitive compared to in and the nature of those credit sensitive instruments today is higher rated and higher quality again this was a purposeful strategy shift from lessons learned during the great recession so the natural question after these three slides is so youve eliminated those activities that drove the highest losses but are there other portfolios hidden in your overall loan portfolio that could blow up and have losses and again i cant tell you that theres not going to be a specific segment or industry that will not have credit losses depending on the depth and duration but i can tell you our ability to monitor our portfolio the surveillance we have the ability to look at correlated risk of cross portfolios the quality of our risk management team is light years ahead of what it was before and i can tell you that we pivoted over time in the last years on things like contractors or traditional advertising based media so that were able to make decisions quickly to reduce emphasis in certain portfolios over time and weve done that so my confidence that there are hidden pockets of risk is much higher than it would have been during the great recession and i hope that those three slides provide some perspective on how thoughtful weve been about building our portfolio and the fact that we did take to heart lessons learned during the last downturn on slide youll see just an overview of the portfolio and the truth is its a straightforward midsized bank typical portfolio with obviously a sponsor book in there where we have industry expertise you can see a high level breakdown here of the billion and in the indiscernible on the right youll see where those exposures reside so for consumer finance the billion portfolio billion of that are prime end market residential mortgages and home equity loans and then a small pocket of consumer finance which includes lendingclub i will speak to each of these on the following slides our commercial real estate is comprised of a majority of it in our commercial banking investor cre book run by bill wrang for over years here whos had great asset performance even during the great recession that also encapsulates our business banking investor cre and owner occupied cre and it also includes owner occupied middle market commercial real estate loans as well as some technology infrastructure data center like real estate secured businesses the ci is typical ci in middle market in sponsor specialty it includes our enterprise leveraged loans assetbased lending and equipment finance and then youll see the investment securities where we make the point again on the breakdown between noncredit and credit sensitive instruments and on page in the supplemental information please dont turn to it now youll see a detailed breakdown of the investment securities portfolio which i will not cover here on page residential mortgage the key takeaway on this slide is that our billion mortgage portfolio is a high quality prime inmarket centrally underwritten portfolio with high fico scores and modest ltvs both at origination and when updated for today credit performance not surprisingly has been outstanding and i told you that weve only had a modest level of modification in payment deferral request todate on this portfolio on page home equity is pretty much the same story as mortgages inmarket prime strong fico and ltv metrics at origination and even slightly improved when updated today we managed this book effectively through end of draw on much of the portfolio and we have not seen interestingly any defensive drawdown activities on the unfunded portion of these home equity loans thus far into the crisis i also want to highlight one carrot there that close to ph of this portfolio is in a first lien position on slide personal lending a very small million of it represents lendingclub and as you know its about million and has been coming down since a peak of about million million we stopped webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 purchasing lower tranches in purchasing just as and bs and recently just as and we are no longer purchasing lendingclub if you look at it the fico scores are strong and have been improving and we have not seen credit performance in this small portfolio deteriorate yet well obviously watch it closely weve got good geographic diversity in the portfolio and over the time weve been involved with lendingclub we have seen performance in the portfolio that meets or exceeds expectations on page in commercial real estate our total cre portfolio weve had meaningful and targeted growth over the last few years as we are good at it and weve been underweight compared to peers and when compared to regulatory concentration hurdles majority of this business is in our investor cre line within the commercial bank led by the same management team for many years and through cycles ill provide more detail on that billion representing the you see in the top chart there on the next page the overall portfolio was well diversified with limited exposure in more volatile sectors and you know very little hotel exposure very little discretionary retail exposure weve had less office exposure as well than we did you know years ago so on the next page lets do a deep dive on our largest exposures and our largest part of the portfolio focusing on investor cre weve had a targeted strategy of growing multifamily and industrial selectively financing office projects and strong markets as i mentioned i think six times on this call already and i apologize bill wrang with us for more than years who came out of aetna manages this portfolio its more of an institutional quality real estate portfolio it performed exceptionally well during the last downturn it tends to be lower yielding but more resilient during a tough credit time we partner with experienced sponsors and equity partners and provide well structured solutions with sufficient cushion to withstand volatility if you look here at the origination metrics theyve been very steady over the last few years despite competing in a highly competitive lending environment and that discipline tends to serve us well its also translated into very strong updated portfolio statistics which are at the bottom chart there so were not talking about loanto value real estate loans were talking about a portfolio of loantovalue real estate loans with an average debt service coverage ratio of nearly two times overall and not surprisingly asset quality is really strong in this portfolio and weve been reaching out to our customers aggressively and we will be managing through whatever the crisis brings us but we feel really good about this portfolio on page youll see the ci portfolio balanced and diversified this includes our sponsor and leveraged portfolios which are primarily industry focused collaterally focused businesses in abl and equipment finance indiscernible businesses in middle market and business banking both meaningful concentrations are in broad diversified categories such as services and communications a good portion of which is software technology and infrastructure originated in our sponsor business and weve maintained lower exposure in construction and retail as well as finance companies which we feel could represent correlated risk with our broader portfolio so we have deemphasized over time those segments on page well talk about sponsor specialty and leveraged on these last two pages and ill ask jason to provide a little more color and context one of the important things that we always talk about and im not sure is fully understood is that our sponsor specialty business is billion or something only a third of that is leveraged loans were reporting here leveraged loans which are leveraged at origination based on regulatory definitions generally three by four senior to total leverage so a full twothirds of our sponsor specialty portfolio is acquisition and industry specific financing that does not qualify as leveraged loans webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 most of our leveraged loans are in this book over weve been lending to sponsor backed and leveraged companies since when chris motl and i arrived at the bank and as you saw earlier in the presentation the performance has been strong and in line with overall ci even through a cycle we meaningfully shifted this book over time to make sure that were lending to noncyclical end markets that have recurring protectable predictable streams of cash flow youll see that software tech and infrastructure has grown from about onethird of the portfolio to almost again thats because of the nature of the transactions in the underlying companies and these companies seem to be less susceptible to this particular crisis as well healthcare is another defined vertical what we seek to support routine medical services that will benefit from demographic trends and at the same time weve shifted away from some segments that are less predictable and less protectable from a cash flow perspective and the last slide ill cover before i let jason provide a little context on sponsor specialty is slide and this is something that i talked about a little over a year ago on an earnings call when we talked about leveraged lending this page shows comparative metrics between what were originating in sponsor specialty and the broader leveraged loan capital markets on average we have to turns less leverage on the deals we do versus the market at less risk weve maintained discipline on covenants with only of our book being covenant lite where the general market is almost covenant lite the leveraged deals we have those that are leveraged loans are still to turn inside the broader leveraged market and nonleverages are almost turns inside the market when we look at the borrowers ability to service debt we have a very strong profile with to having fixed charge coverage ratios of greater than times and on average for both leveraged and nonleveraged deals in sponsor our loantovalue thats the loan to the enterprise value is between and on average in most cases with significant cash equity or junior debt beneath us and the sponsors that we have worked with through financial crises with relationships over a long time have deep financial and management resources to help us through a downturn we saw that during the crisis jason can you put maybe a finer point on some of those or fill in something i might have missed jason soto executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yes look john i think you hit all of the key points i guess the only thing i would say is weve really increased the percentage of direct deals that weve done over the last four five years from about half to about twothirds which we think is important and i guess the last thing id probably add and i think it just speaks to the credit culture here at the bank is our strategy in sponsor and leverage have not only been deliberate but it also has been very collaborative between the lines of business and credit weve been particularly disciplined in moving away from the areas that you mentioned like traditional media restaurants as well as smaller cyclical credits where weve had some historical losses and weve also been very clear about our underwriting parameters as weve grown and for example in ph tech and infrastructure which is the largest segment when we talk about financing or recurring revenue business models of the exposure in that book has over recurring revenue theres only one deal that has less than of recurring revenue in that book which again represents almost half of the sponsor book webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 if deals come in outside those parameters indiscernible generally just pass and again its not to say that those deals will be bulletproof right it really depends on the end markets those customers serve and the competitive dynamics but our thesis is that the services and software being provided are making customers more efficient and smarter about their businesses so we expect that once installed the revenue will be sticky john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks jason i appreciate it before we go to qa id like to acknowledge the departures of jim smith our chairman and john crawford our former lead director from websters board of directors following our virtual annual meeting of shareholders which will occur this thursday the insights direction and dedication that jim and john have given to webster over so many years have helped to make this organization what it is today and will continue to influence us into the future they are both personal mentors to me and im proud to call them friends i appreciate everyones patience going a little bit longer in the comments this morning and i hope they were helpful with that rob im happy to open it up for questions question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your questions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning to start on the reserve so given glenn you called out some of the assumptions in the reserve and the economic outlook appears to be a bit worse than that just based on how you guys are seeing how cecl is now working should we see a covid19 impact in the reserve in similar to what we saw on given the change of model assumptions look like theyre coming glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no i mean we dont see that i talked in my comments about first let me back up and just say our cecl is an estimate of multiple scenarios and modeled bosses as a result of that and then we did a bottomsup granular build as i indicated so i think our reserves that are provisioned in the second quarter will depend less on like a shock and more on the expected duration and severity of the economy over the next one or two years right and so we additionally we have to assess the impact of the stimulus programs and our own loan modification webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 programs and then well evaluate that over the next couple of weeks but i dont see it as anywhere near where we were in  john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp steve let me give you context too i know its so hard for you and obviously its hard for all of us because what were doing is with the knowledge that we have as were going through the process were giving we use a third party obviously with respect to data like many of our peers do and then we look at that and we look at the applicability to our portfolio with what were seeing the results of our bottomsup approach to looking at all the commercial credits reaching out to our borrowers and it all filters in and what we try to determine at that time with the best forward outlook we have on the economy and the best information we have on portfolio performance is our models assess the life of life losses lifetime losses life of loan losses in the portfolio and so what i think will happen in  is the banks will continue to revise based on what the forward outlook is and i think glenn made a really good point i also think that well have better indications of how much the fiscal stimulus and other programs have helped to help maybe mitigate or offset some of that and at the end of the day depending on the depth and severity of the future economic forecast at that point in time that will impact and influence the magnitude of either additional provisions or no additional provisions or if somehow we miraculously start to reverse course the release of provisions over time but i think its really based on you know what the macroeconomic forecasts will be as we approach the end of the second quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc john in terms of the specific exposures i appreciate all the color youre giving on credit but if we look at the most impacted sectors on slide which is really helpful but theres a lot to unpack on that slide can you walk us through which of those do you see as the most risk specific to webster and maybe which do you see as being less risky just specific to you guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes and ill let jason obviously because hes got a good perspective on it for us and you know i think restaurants are obviously probably at risk i look at that portfolio we do have some you know broader those arent you know on the corner store restaurants for the most part theyre brought our sponsor backed restaurants with high brand names so you know we believe theres a good chance of survival but theyll be impacted we have very little oil and gas very little travel and leisure from a hotel perspective so for me i think about restaurants i think about what exposure we might have to nondiscretionary retail although i said that thats relatively small so i would say that those are probably the most directly impacted jason i dont know if you want to provide some color jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yes sure happy to yes id echo the comment on restaurants right luckily we have a relatively small exposure and its a portfolio that weve actually been working down over the last couple of years i would also say that our average ph whole size in that portfolio is subsequently less than other parts of most of that exposures in the sponsor portfolio and we havent todate taken material losses so far weve got borrowers who webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 are have multiple locations diversified geographically but thats certainly part of the portfolio that i would be concerned about weve already talked about retail a lot of that is collateralized i guess a few of the other sectors that im focused on is things like advertising base which again we dont have a ton of companies that put on host or support conferences and large gatherings right in business services to those and also were seeing a lot of pressure at the moment in some of the routine healthcare services like dentists optometrists physical therapy things like that but you assume that most of that will recover so there are definitely some pockets that were looking at you could even focus a little bit on perhaps smaller indiscernible consumer behavior change after this those are the things that i start to think about in the areas that i focus on steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you thats helpful and maybe if i could squeeze one in for chad if we look at footing and account growth in hsa it seems to slow yearoveryear for you and the industry is this a new normal for the hsa business john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp chad do you want it directly chad wilkins a hsa bank webster financial corp yeah thanks steve i would say its not a new normal i think that were going through one weve seen some as ive talked in multiples over the last several quarters weve seen slowness related to some of the tailwinds subsiding in the industry i do think that in a recession theres an opportunity for hsas or high deductible plans to grow more significant because they tend to do well in economic downturns indiscernible reduce medical costs and so on i think there is a potential impact ongoing impact as we look throughout the year with regard to the current pandemic indiscernible benefits plans andor youve seen some indiscernible of folks impacting plans so were paying close attention to that we havent seen any impact yet in the first quarter other than perhaps some slowdown in some of the rfp volume in the end of the quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right very good thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks steve operator the next question is from the line of collyn gilbert with kbw please proceed with your questions collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 thanks good morning guys glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp good morning collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so obviously its a million dollar question on how you guys are thinking about the reserve and how you build that going forward but just trying to put that into some sort of context so if we look at what you added or you added for the loan growth this quarter it looks like it was like a ph million reserve can you just maybe help us sort of understand why that why that reserve came in the way it did youre sitting at ph million where it could go just kind of just framing that a little bit for us indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure so collyn yeah so most of the growth that we had in the quarter as i said in my prepared comments was on the commercial side so were up by million so depending on what portfolio grows and the risk profile of the portfolio that will drive the reserves for the quarter so thats why its a little lower than the total reserve collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah collyn its go ahead collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no go ahead go ahead john john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no i was just going to say its really hard to give any more context except to say i think we chose as glenn told you the actual underlying economic performance variables on unemployment and gdp and house prices that he used we then did a qualitative review as jason spoke to really bottomsup and i think we really know our portfolio very well looked at potential risk rating migration over time the level of modification activity and what we tried to do was on the day that we put our pencils down we tried to using our models and using our qfactor come up with life of loan losses across the billion loan portfolio and across a securities portfolio of billion and so i think when you think about what all the other banks are doing some of them put their pencils down earlier we tried to take a conservative approach at our current economic forecast also looking at some of the potential behavioral elements in our portfolio and so we feel really good that we meet the requirements of cecl webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 and obviously what happens with this the good part about it is as we move forward based on actual indiscernible portfolio and based on a forward look of the economy our the view will change and the models will change and its really hard to do an applestoapples comparison what i can tell you is we feel really good about our portfolio as i walk through our cecl is not an indication that were trying to get ahead of some issue we dont see we literally feel like right now thats the appropriate number given all the information we have collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful and then i guess it is a hard question to answer but just anecdotally and you guys have so much detail which the five of you offered were fantastic thank you for that but the question obviously is the duration of this of the covid19 experience do you have a sense of what indiscernible the majority of your customers like how long they can sort of withstand and stay operating and stay afloat and modify and i mean is this something they can carry through the next quarter or two or if this goes im just trying to get a sense of where their heads are on how theyre thinking about the duration of this john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes and i will let jason comment here as well i mean obviously thats a tough question but the sense i think the sense is if you look at i mean jason made a very important point we showed modifications in line draws we then also on the documents we then told you verbally what it was as of april and we made a comment that the activity had slowed which is interesting right so the number of modification requests and the number of defensive line draws slowed over time thats actually a positive sign were working with a lot of our borrowers regulators have given banks greater flexibility in terms of being able to make payment deferrals and modifications over time and i do think that given the parameters and banks capital position and this just isnt for webster im giving you kind of a general view that we have the opportunity to modify three months we can do another three or six month modification at the end of that period theres a lot of liquidity coming into the market theres a lot of programs like the main street lending program hasnt even hit yet which will give some larger borrowers opportunity for additional capital if they cant get it from their banks the ppp program is being refunded the checks are coming out to individuals and families so i think there is a sense that if we actually start what is it opening up america again within a reasonable period of time that all of those bridges with the bank support and with good operating management by our borrowers that we can get through this so thats anecdotal right youre asking me an anecdotal question im giving you an anecdotal answer that says we havent seen a lot of our borrowers say if i dont get out of this in the next two months im gone right if everybody is working together and there is a feeling that banks can be supportive sponsors can be supportive of their companies the government is providing financial support so thats just my view jason i dont know if you have anything else to add jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah no look i think you hit all the right points in terms of the stimulus unemployment benefits ppp as evidence of that perhaps is weve actually seen some borrowers withdraw modification requests once the ppp sort of went into effect and so were seeing some evidence of that support and then what i could do is i could break down if you think about the type of modifications that weve been doing by line of business i would say webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 generally three to six months right so on the consumer side its been almost all three months so wed obviously have some ability to further extend if the impact of the virus goes on further on our small business business banking about a third has been up to three months and twothirds has been up to six months on the commercial side its been up to three to six months and twothirds of that is payment related balances more covenants and borrowing base so i kind of look at this right now between the stimulus programs and the modifications that weve been granting three to six months plus the benefit of those programs feels like a lot of our borrowers can withstand that timing of impact collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks jason collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thank you ill leave it there im sure everyone else will ask the questions that i have so thanks guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thats collyn appreciate it operator thank you the next question is from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush securities please proceed with your questions david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc indiscernible so i wanted to ask about the leveraged loans you mentioned about how sponsors have been willing to step up and support their companies if we look back to the financial crisis how much do you have a sense of how much new capital was actually contributed by sponsors to support their companies to support the challenges they face back then john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp i dont have a number david and i would be doing you a disservice if i guessed one but what i can tell you and if you remember in that call a year ago i talked about that our credit performance in our sponsor specialty business was actually better than many of our secured lending portfolios it was one of the best performers in terms of actual loss it had risk rating migration in it but what i can tell you just again anecdotally and from experience is that if a sponsor has significant cash equity in a platform company unless there is some sort of paradigm shift that makes that company completely not valuable if of the capital structure is their equity and were lending at of the capital structure theyre not just going to turn over the keys if they think that this is a temporary crisis webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 so again i think it comes back to depth and duration and we have evidenced that during the financial crisis if were backing good sponsors who are buying good companies indiscernible with banks providing covenant relief and additional liquidity and the sponsors providing capital support those businesses tend to make it through and again thats anecdotal cant make any promises but thats what weve seen and we saw during the financial crisis jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp john if you dont mind i could jump in a little bit as well i would say that as you all know the level of dry powder thats out there sitting in private equity funds right to support existing investments has never been higher and so and you couple that with the fact that the multiples for lbos have gone up and so the percentage of equity thats in these capital structures disproportionate increase versus the amount of debt that had gone on so you know i think theres going to be a lot of incentives to support borrowers that have good business models that are experiencing sort of deep shortterm impact and we were actually already seeing that with some of the modification requests that weve got and were sponsoring and wed be willing to put in some equity provide us with a little bit of a indiscernible to get access more liquidity and things like that david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc and you just touched on in a little bit for one of my followups are you getting anything in return for providing you know loan modifications to these leveraged borrowers either in the form of consent fees or additional equity contribution from the sponsors to provide those modifications jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah we are getting some additional equity we are getting in some cases that indiscernible revolve for million more and well give you a guarantee were taking the opportunity to add in libor floors on a good substantial portion that are coming in which is obviously helpful in a different way so were not i dont think were focusing so much on big fees right our goal is to help our borrowers at this point get through the time but also improve our position where we can john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thats right id remind you that these are really strong relationships over time so both parties work to get to the best outcome so good answer jason and the answer is yes were close to these folks and we work with them not at crosspurposes david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that and then shifting gears to the state farm hsa acquisition when out of curiosity when did state farm put it up for sale was this kind of a recent thing or has this been in the works for a while and was this a competitive bidding process chad wilkins a hsa bank webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 so it was a couple months that weve been talking to them as far as competitive i think it landed more on our ability and our capabilities from an acquisition standpoint less on price it wasnt it wasnt an auction or anything like that and weve struck a very good partnership with them which were looking forward to working with them going forward david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc and your appetite for additional hsa acquisitions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure yeah it remains strong chad wilkins a hsa bank webster financial corp yes yes david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much chad wilkins a hsa bank webster financial corp sure operator the next question is from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question q hi good morning this is indiscernible filling in for jared john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning q first good morning first looking at the level of ppp lending it was a little bit smaller than what weve seen out of some of your peers was this a choice at webster or was this something structural that limited the level of production and as we look at future sba programs coming onboard what level of participation should we expect from webster webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thats a good question now certainly we wanted to help every small business borrower and customer of webster that we could we got through lets say approximately applications approved funding plus or minus a few percentage points on both sides of that we fully expect to trump those numbers significantly higher over the next few days as weve got internal approvals so i would say no the answer is we at yeomans effort we repositioned almost people in the organization to go through it obviously there were technical issues at points with indiscernible system weve worked on trying to make our automated process a little bit more efficient so id say were kind of right in that national average although youre right to point out that we trailed some and were going to work our butt off to make sure that when the funds come up open up again that we close that gap a little bit q okay and then can you disclose what the kind of weighted average fee was for the indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so i think were probably in the range between and ph timor and were funding basically the ppp all after basis points so it helps us q and then just last one for me not sure if you can disclose this or not but the current reserving for the lendingclub loans and for the restaurant portfolio john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no were not going to disclose by segment although again ill just make a qualitative determination that didnt drive reserving disproportionately to anything else and its less than of the portfolio and it does not have a disproportionate impact based on our loss modeling q okay thats helpful thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp okay ph timor be safe operator our next question is from the line of laurie hunsicker with compass point please proceed with your questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah hi good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp laurie good morning laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc just wondered if we could go back to slide which by the way your detail is great i really appreciate that if we can just start by looking at the total the total of billion that you have here how much of that is real estate on this slide if you know approximately i mean obviously you gave us the detail around the retail being cre so that puts it at million just didnt know if you had how much is actually real estate john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp right jason probably does not have that off the top of the head but i would actually want to i asked you first jason and then otherwise i can give a relatively rough estimate jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah the main components in there that are retail and is hotels and motels right so it does not include some of the multifamily and office properties that i mentioned before its also going to be in retail as we talked about i think is the number is cre collateralized retail and we talked about some of the characteristics of that right so call that million or so call the hotels another million there may be a little bit scattered in the restaurants in our small business but thats probably the sum total of the real estate a little less than billion is my guess john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and on construction and related jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp you know thats mostly equipment finance right that would be indiscernible jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp right trucking type of exposure thats probably million million of it laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 okay thats helpful thanks and then in your travel leisure category what primarily is that john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah so thats everything from fitness facilities to conference providers or companies that support conferences indiscernible rock climbing those types of golf clubs ymca its a variety of different types of leisure activities for the most part a little less in travel unless we do have one or two borrowers that support travel events right they put on travel shows and so thats probably the lions share that goes in there laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay helpful thanks and then roughly of your billion or so of the leverage lending how much of that actually shows up on slide glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp on slide indiscernible laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc billion i guess how much maybe ask it another way how much of the billion is leveraged lending the john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp million laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay thats great okay thanks and then also i appreciate all the details you gave us around modifications of your total book the billion or so of ss how much of that is modified already john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp ss excluding leverage is about laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp the leverage is lower than that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay okay thats great and then just last question of your billion commercial real estate how much of that is multifamily and whats the ltv on that and if you dont have that i can follow up with you off the call glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah you can you can see that on the chart right sorry go ahead john john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no go ahead please laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc i missed that im sorry glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah you can see that on the chart that its roughly of billion and if you focus on the exposure the majority of which is in the cre line of business the ltv on apartments is laurie havener hunsicker q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp you got it laurie glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thats fine operator our next question is from the line of casey haire with jefferies please proceed with your question casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys followup john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hi casey webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc hey guys follow up on the glenn the average earning asset growth youre expecting i think in the second quarter here glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp right casey haire q analyst jefferies llc just the composition of that i mean the million that you booked quartertodate is roughly half that move and it sounds like youre going to youre going to be doing more on the program refunds so my question is is this growth is this going to be entirely ppp or is there going to be any core loan growth along this glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no so i think a lot of our commercial growth came in at period end so well get to pull that into the second quarter and on a ppp side its probably about half of it and so id say above on average if you look that is probably about million john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah and casey if that question also kind of tries to get to whats going on in the core underlying i made the comment we closed the big deal in april on a technology infrastructure transaction i looked at our pipeline its clearly lower than its been generally this is a seasonal low pipeline anyway but its slightly lower than last year as i said were going to be more careful obviously youre lending into uncertainty and so you need to make sure that the underlying fundamentals work obviously only cutting the other way you do have a little bit more leverage and i use that word i probably shouldnt use that word but as a lender you have a little bit more leverage to make sure that your structure and your pricing work so i would say glenn is right it seems a indiscernible john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp in fact it yeah in fact we had a lot of fundings at the end of the year well carry at the end of the quarter well carry through the next quarter weve got ppp and through some from the main street lending program and then a lower level but a decent level of organic growth and then the last thing i will say is we do anticipate and im always asked about pay downs i do think just with the general level of uncertainty and lower economic activity well probably see lower pay downs which will help to keep that earning asset number up casey haire q analyst jefferies llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 okay great and just if i place together the nii and earning asset it looks like youre implying a nim down about bps in the second quarter can you just confirm that and then if you could were spot rates for loan yields and deposit costs at basis points if you have that glenn glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so yeah so i think your nim is probably in the range and i think if you look at our outlook on rates going into the second quarter were assuming the 10year its probably around basis points with threemonth libor about this is and this is the full quarter average about basis points so one month libor about basis points and youve seen that trade up close to basis points but we think that will come back in and if that comes obviously around basis points so the market rate continue to go down and i think so i think if you look at our net interest income you have continued rate pressure but is offset by loan volume so the net result is our net interest income is flat basically flat quarteroverquarter but i think your nim estimate is probably in the range casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and just last one on the capital management front no i understand that ppp is carries a zero risk weight but it does hurt the ph tc ratio at today where is is there a floor that where you guys would not want to go even you would not want to see that dip below even regardless of what you did with ppp glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp i think we have plenty of room there its it would be very low i mean its gotten below before we didnt have any issue with it casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got it thank you glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you casey operator thank you our next question is from the line of matthew breese with stephens please proceed with your question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey good morning matt and you put out a whole bunch of good credit pieces in the last few weeks matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i appreciate that thank you just on the ppp wanted to just a point of clarification how are you treating the fees are those going to roll through nii or noninteresting income and then what is your average life of loan there glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so were assuming about months in the average life of loan and yes it will roll through nii until to the extent theres any pull forward obviously that would pop nim right and then net interest income matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay okay and then just looking at some of the more granular aspects of the ci portfolio you mentioned that your equipment finance is of that book can you just walk us through some of the common types of equipment that you like to underwrite or stay away from and if you have it i would love to hear how much of this equipment if you know is active versus idle right now john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yes thats a great question and obviously weve lowered the amount of disclosure because the portfolio used to be over a billion its much smaller now i can tell you that its generally things like yellow metals fleets of school buses tractor beds and other things jason i dont know you probably have more of a granular insight into the collateral types i dont think we have the active and dormant stats right now but jason do you have anything to add there jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah no i dont have the details on whats idle and whats sort of working at this point but you hit the major categories its primarily trucking its auto transport theres some yellow iron and cranes a little bit of construction weve reduced that a fair amount as well as buses whether itd be mostly charter buses so its but its definitely more on the trucking side which its interesting were seeing modifications there but and there are certain companies that just flat out it just depends on what markets theyre serving right so but yeah thats the primary breakdown john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and i think i think matt i may have shared this and im not sure i believe that of the commercial banking units of modifications the actual borrowers that about of those are small ticket equipment financed so we are seeing some activity there but as jason said its kind of hit or miss in terms of whats happening there so small dollar amounts but more higher volume request for modifications in equipment finance but well try and disclose more next time around webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then a similar question on cre there is roughly million in healthcare theres another million healthcare loans in the ci portfolio can you just provide a little bit more detail on the types of healthcare whether its hospitals or outpatient skilled nursing nursing homes that type of thing jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah you want me to take john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure yeah go ahead jason jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp okay yeah its mostly skilled nursing right is what weve got is probably about million and then weve got what ill call some senior living facilities right that are sort of lump to the same category whether its independent living assisted living and memory care i think john mentioned before in his comments data centers is a big is another section of about million and those are real high quality assets with year to year contracts with really really high quality borrowers aa aaa borrowers takeorpay contracts and then on the midmarket side its more owner occupied type properties in footprint matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay thats all i had i appreciate taking my questions thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp any time matt operator the next question is from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks i guess going back to the reserve given your assumptions that we could be fairly much in a v shaped type recovery can you just talk about the magnitude of difference if i get that if unemployment goes where gdp falls goes down to its probably not as big as the initial gdp move but whats the magnitude if you assume instead of a second half recovery is maybe a recovery so we actually go through say three more quarters of very depressed economic activity john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 im not sure i can quantify that for you ken what i can say is that if the assumptions around recovery end up being more dire as you move forward well probably see some of the management overlay that we put forth this quarter actually flow into the numbers so we might not need as much qualitative adjustment to the underlying models but i would say glenn whats the most recent april the difference in terms of what we see in terms of debt glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp ph present gdp john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so its probably another basis points lower in  but then the recovery is much stronger im not sure ken just to go back a little bit im not sure were thinking of a vshaped recovery were thinking of a more gradual recovery towards the second half of the year and thats really what our estimate again is a mix of multiple scenarios and multiple model losses and thats really what were focused on but it is something as john indicates that were monitoring very closely and i dont think anyone has a precise answer right now but based on everything weve had and making model adjustments and then looking at our portfolio building it up from a granular basis and seeing how our customers would behave over the next to days this is where we ended up john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah and glenn i completely understand where youre trying to get to but its exactly what glenn said because were going to see if we see riskrating migration depending on the impact of all of the stimulus and the government programs and our modifications over time were going to see changes in whether its a v or a u or an lshape and so we kind of have to wait to see how that plays out to really figure out because we may have a more a longer recovery period but we may see a really strong impact of fiscal stimulus and all of those variables go into our modeling and our cecl and we kind of have to wait to the end of the quarter to see where that is ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc go it yeah i guess i was trying to figure out like whether it be like i say an lshaped recovery you less gdp decline like if that could have say multiples of the reserve build they saw this quarter again i am just trying to size the impact on what matters more to your reserve john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah no i think in all of those different models we ran i dont think its multiples right i think multiples is maybe more the depth or another shock or some issue but in terms of the nature of the recovery if you think i think that webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 death may be more impactful than the duration in some respects so i do think that if you look at our going out if we end up going away from a v or u more towards an l but its not multiples ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc right john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp in any one particular quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great all right thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc sure operator the next question is from the line of bernard horn with polaris capital please proceed with your questions bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc hi good morning glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp good morning bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc just a few questions and by the way great detail on the slides and all the explanations with respect to credit jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp thanks bernie webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc just on the ppp did i understand you right that it looks like the margin on that program was about either from to basis points to to basis points on rate with a 75basis point funding and then did you what kind of additional fees are you incurring in those i mean earning and are you dealing with existing customers and are those providing additional relationship activities that you might develop into other business john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp so i think were probably glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so i think bernie its glenn good morning were probably we have a coupon of about and then with the fees were probably in the range between to the funding is at about basis points through the ph pplf which is you set up uniquely for this so that that gets you probably maybe a little higher than what your range was bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc so the program has about a interest rate and then has sliding fees depending on the size you got to look for were doing i think about of our applications that have been below so those carry higher levels of fees so you kind of put that all together and it increases nim to glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp the average life does mean your spread could be to john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and your question on customers versus noncustomers we have we work with both and we havent denied we our primary focus is to help our customers and as you can tell bernie from the stats we gave unfortunately when the money ran out we havent helped as many customers as i would have like to help albeit we did an unbelievable job indiscernible the people working remotely from and bringing people in from other areas and leveraging technology but weve accepted applications from both primarily roughly of the applications we received both from customers glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc would that provide you with any opportunity to do more business with them i mean im just wondering if it allows you to get deeper into the customer webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah im going to be honest with you philosophically its not our primary concern right now to try and be part of this solution and im actually talking with other bank ceos on a frequent basis about making sure that this program does what it should be but certainly if youre there and you take care of your customers and non customers presumably thats going to have an added benefit overtime and i think you know well obviously be able to talk about impact to customers and noncustomers as the program works itself through bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc very helpful thanks on the securities portfolio was the increase on slide as a result of market appreciation with major drops in interest rates or did you add to the to the portfolios glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp bernie youre referencing to slide bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc sorry glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp okay yeah so we did add to the portfolio you can see that in our balance sheet period and i think grew up million quarteroverquarter bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc okay so indiscernible glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp im sorry bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc so you actively purchased additional securities it wasnt just from the increased rates drop glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah we didnt we didnt webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc okay so i guess that glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp go ahead bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc i mean in part to indiscernible at sixyear duration in part to help or improve our asset sensitivity glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp early in the quarter bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc yeah yeah so i guess that partially answers my next part of the question which is given that that portfolio has swung from a total loss to i mean from a loss to a gain any given that interest rates are so low where they are right now can you comment on whether you might change your outlook on how you hold that securities portfolio john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp i think its too early glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp too early to say bernie in terms of glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp we obviously like it from an interest rate risk standpoint we use it to manage our asset sensitivity and we use it the best portion of our liquidity so i think wed sort of triangulate those three and we arrive at where we think we could be obviously theres a lower risk weighted securities so it doesnt take up a lot of capital either so we like where were positioned right now bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc okay last question is on could you comment on the cd roll forward and repricing of what youre seeing there webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp so i think weve seen the cd balance has come down part of that in response we pulled back on a lot of promotional programs in most of our markets so i think you see what you see in these customers sort of pausing and moving into other funds not locking up their money over a longer term and so as a result our cd portfolio has shortened but again it helps our asset sensitivity bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc and any comment on the amount of those cds that will be repricing over the next two or three quarters glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp yeah i dont have that in front of me i can come back to you on that bernie bernard robert horn q president portfolio manager polaris capital management llc well do thanks very much john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks bernie operator gentlemen our next question is from the line of william wallace with raymond james william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey good morning william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc on the on slide im wondering if you could just talk a little bit about the risk migration of the ratings within the past category as you modify these loans and if you didnt give it already how has that modifications number changed since john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah ill let jason do that we did update william the revolver draws modifications on those pages with and jason will repeat that for you and there hasnt been let me make one general statement and i can give it to jason there hasnt been much risk rating migration yet right because youre going through this process and youre really looking at reported numbers where your customers are and things that are purely temporary and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 covid19 related from a modification perspective dont necessarily warrant a downgrade based on regulatory guidance specific to the pandemic so we havent seen much and i think when all of you get on the calls with all of the banks in the second for the second quarter earnings youre probably going to be able to see a better indication of actual ratings migration but jason do you want to update those modification stats and revolver draws stats from page as of april 16th jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah sure up from million to million and revolver draws only up modestly from million to million and in terms of the risk rating migration yeah i think were sort of taking a all right lets wait and see so to speak and as we get more information as to how long the pandemic will pandemic impact will last but weve made sure as glenn went through that weve captured an appropriate reserves to reflect the modification activity that weve seen and the potential risk rating migration we expect william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay so i mean i know its impossible to know exactly at what point youll start to adjust but is it three months when you start to worry about what the cash flow recoveries for these loans might look like is it six months or is it too impossible to give it john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah no no i dont think theres a rule of thumb so you saw a downgrades we have higher classifieds in the quarter were watching every single loan in every single portfolio so were just being disciplined to the approach that you downgrade once the ongoing financial metrics trigger into a new grade category or if you think youre potentially at risk for further downgrade and it goes to watch special mention or substandard so well do that and were still doing that im just saying given where we are we have not yet seen a meaningful risk rating migration that you may see depending on the depth and duration of the downturn william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay yeah thank you very much appreciate it guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you william appreciate it operator our next question is from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please proceed with your question mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning and thank you for all that detail on credit just two quick questions first can you give us a sense for what percentage of your commercial loan portfolio do you think ultimately will go into forbearance and then secondly if you could just glenn clarify your comments on the margin i missed those i apologize the outlook for the margin webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp okay no mark actually its great to have you on the call and weve gone a long time on this call so appreciate you hanging in there ill take a crack and then maybe see if jason wants to put another comment whats very interesting is and we talked about this that if you look at the modifications through april 16th right we gave that number verbally on the whole portfolio slightly up and the revolver draws weve seen a slower trend right so its hard to predict again looking at depth and duration its whos going to come to us for more modifications we dont know whether the ppp program if in fact even if they authorize another billion if you look at the statistics probably everybody that qualifies doesnt get funded so maybe if those people who are eligible and do not receive a loan maybe they come and ask for modifications so there could be an uptick after that but whats fascinating is is the amount of defensive draws in the portfolio and the amount of modification requests is sort of kind of slowed down with respect to pace and trending so it doesnt look like now at least in what were seeing that were going to see a flurry of additional modifications i think it will be dependent upon particular challenges by independent under independent circumstances by borrower jason i dont know if you think thats accurate correct me if you if you want to jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah all id say is weve actually seen net revolver reductions through the first half of the month from we talked about the million or so that were draws in march and almost million that has been paid back down so thats a bit of an encouraging sign and again across all the lines of business weve seen less modification over the last couple of weeks in the last week in particular its hard to peg exactly where we think this might end up but what i can tell you is we do have that weekly update and bottoms up approach that we go through updating those numbers exactly and so we do think were going to see more than what weve seen so far it may slow down for now we may see another waive when some of the initial modification requests be granted sort of come back for further discussion once we have more information but were on it and we have a very good feel as to what we think we might see john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and mark i dont know if you were on the call at the beginning but i did give as of april 16th right in the mortgage and residential books combined thats about a billion prime book about million or had requested and been granted modifications as of april 16th thats last week in small business borrowers reflecting million or of our business banking billion business banking portfolio have been modified and in commercial about borrowers representing billion or of the commercial funded loan book had been requested or granted modifications mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thanks and then the question on the margin for glenn glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp sure and so mark good morning were assuming the following as far as our average rate forecast for the second quarter we think in a 10year swap of probably around basis points threeyear libor rate on average around basis points and a onemonth libor rate somewhere around basis points and of course webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2020 indiscernible and so its making that sort of assumption again i would say that you can assume that our net interest income will be flat quarteroverquarter say at ph somewhere around there there continued to be margin pressure and it could be basis points to basis points depending on the mix so its hard to tell this early but i mean thats about where we think well be at this point mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks mark stay safe and well please operator thank you at this time weve reached the end of our questionandanswer session now i hand
