deposit insurance corporation fdic as its deposit insurer webster banks deposits are insured by the fdic up to the applicable deposit insurance limits in accordance with fdic laws and regulations the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of doddfrank significantly changed the financial regulatory regime in the united states since the enactment of doddfrank us banks and financial services firms have been subject to enhanced regulation and oversight several provisions of doddfrank are subject to further rulemaking guidance and interpretation by the federal banking agencies the current administration and its appointees to the federal banking agencies have expressed interest in reviewing revising and perhaps repealing portions of doddfrank and certain of its implementing regulations as such among other things the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act of egrrcpa amended certain provisions of doddfrank as well as statutes administered by the federal reserve system the fdic and the occ the amendments resulting from egrrcpa provide limited regulatory relief for certain financial institutions and additional tailoring of banking and consumer protection laws while preserving the existing framework under which us financial institutions are regulated including the discretionary authority of the federal reserve system the fdic and the occ to supervise bank holding companies and insured depository institutions in addition egrrcpa includes certain other bankingrelated consumer protection and securities lawrelated provisions many of these provisions must be implemented through rules adopted by the federal banking agencies and certain changes remain subject to substantial regulatory discretion of the federal banking agencies although the federal banking agencies have made progress on several rules required under egrrcpa its full impact remains unclear for the immediate future the company expects to continue to evaluate the potential impact of egrrcpa as it is further implemented by the regulators bank holding company regulation webster financial corporation is a bank holding company as defined under the bhc act the bhc act generally limits the business of bank holding companies to banking managing or controlling banks and other activities that the board of governors of the federal reserve system has determined to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident thereto bank holding companies that have elected to become financial holding companies such as webster financial corporation may engage in any activity or acquire and retain the shares of a company engaged in any activity that is either i financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity as determined by the board of governors of the federal reserve system in consultation with the secretary of the treasury or ii complementary to a financial activity and that does not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system as solely determined by the board of governors of the federal reserve system activities that are financial in nature include securities underwriting and dealing insurance underwriting and making merchant banking investments mergers and acquisitions the bhc act bank merger act and other federal and state statutes regulate the direct and indirect acquisition of depository institutions the bhc act requires federal reserve system prior approval for a bank holding company to acquire directly or indirectly or more of any class of voting securities of a commercial bank or its parent holding company and for a company other than a bank holding company to acquire or more of any class of voting securities of a bank or bank holding company under the change in bank control act any person or company may not acquire directly or indirectly control of a bank without providing days prior notice and receiving a nonobjection from the appropriate federal banking agency under the bank merger act the prior approval of the appropriate federal banking agency is required for insured depository institutions to merge or enter into purchase and assumption transactions in reviewing applications seeking approval of merger or purchase and assumption transactions the federal banking agencies will consider among other things the competitive effect and public benefits of the transactions the capital position of the combined banks the applicants performance record under the community reinvestment act of cra and the effectiveness of the merging banks in combating money laundering enhanced prudential standards section of doddfrank imposes enhanced prudential standards on larger banking organizations however egrrcpa makes bank holding companies with less than billion in assets such as webster financial corporation exempt from the enhanced prudential standards imposed under section including but not limited to the resolution planning and enhanced liquidity and risk management requirements therein further on october egrrcpa was amended by raising the applicability threshold for companyrun stress test requirements for bank holding companies from billion or more in assets to billion or more in assets as a result webster financial corporation is relieved from the requirement to conduct companyrun stress testing for itself and webster bank however while the federal banking agencies will not require companyrun stress testing the capital planning and risk management practices of the company will continue to be reviewed through regular supervisory processes of the federal reserve system and the occ the company will continue to perform certain stress tests internally and incorporate the economic models and information developed through its stress testing program into its risk management and business planning activities furthermore under a previously issued rule of the federal reserve system implementing enhanced prudential standards required by doddfrank bank holding companies with more than billion in assets were subject to certain rules including a requirement to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors to manage enterprisewide risk egrrcpa subsequently increased the asset threshold for requiring a bank holding company to establish a separate risk committee of independent directors from billion to billion notwithstanding the changes implemented by egrrcpa the company has retained its risk committee of the board of directors debit card interchange fees doddfrank requires that any interchange transaction fee charged for a debit transaction be reasonable and proportional to the cost incurred by the issuer for the transaction and includes regulations that establish such fee standards eliminate exclusivity arrangements between issuers and networks for debit card transactions limit restrictions on merchant discounting for use of certain payment forms and minimummaximum amount thresholds as a condition for acceptance of credit cards the federal reserve system pursuant to doddfrank approved a final debit card interchange rule which caps an issuers base fee at  per transaction and allows for an additional amount equal to basis points of the transactions value the federal reserve system separately issued a final rule that also allows a fraudprevention adjustment of onecent per transaction conditioned upon an issuer developing implementing and updating reasonably designed fraudprevention policies and procedures identity theft the sec and the commodity futures trading commission cftc jointly issued final rules and guidelines implementing the provisions of doddfrank which require certain regulated entities to establish programs to address risks of identity theft the rules require financial institutions and creditors to develop and implement a written identity theft prevention program that is designed to detect prevent and mitigate identity theft in connection with certain existing accounts or the opening of new accounts the rules include guidelines to assist entities in the formulation and maintenance of programs that would satisfy these requirements in addition the rules establish special requirements for any credit and debit card issuers that are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec or the cftc to assess the validity of notifications of changes of address under certain circumstances webster implemented an id theft prevention program approved by its board of directors in compliance with these requirements volcker rule section of doddfrank commonly known as the volcker rule restricts the ability of banking entities such as webster and webster bank from i engaging in proprietary trading and ii investing in or sponsoring certain covered funds subject to certain limited exceptions under the volcker rule the term covered funds is defined as any issuer that would be an investment company under the investment company act but for the exemption in section 3c1 or 3c7 of that act which includes collateralized loan obligation securities clo and collateralized debt obligation securities there are also several exemptions from the definition of covered fund including among other things loan securitization joint ventures certain types of foreign funds entities issuing assetbacked commercial paper and registered investment companies the egrrcpa and subsequent promulgation of interagency final rules have aimed to simplify and tailor requirements related to the volcker rule including eliminating collection of certain metrics and reducing the compliance burdens associated with other metrics for banks with less than billion in average trading assets and liabilities the federal reserve has granted webster until july to bring its holdings into compliance with the volcker rule dividends the primary source of liquidity at the holding company is dividends from webster bank prior approval from the occ is required for a national bank to declare a dividend in any year that would exceed the sum of its net income for that year and its undistributed net income for the preceding two years less any required transfers to surplus webster bank paid the holding company million in dividends during the year ended december and had million of undistributed net income available for payment of dividends at december in addition webster financial corporation and webster bank are subject to other regulatory policies and requirements relating to the payment of dividends including requirements to maintain adequate capital above regulatory minimums federal regulatory agencies are authorized to determine under certain circumstances relating to the financial condition of a bank holding company or a bank that the payment of dividends would be an unsafe or unsound practice and to prohibit payment thereof the federal banking agencies have indicated that paying dividends that deplete a banks capital base to an inadequate level would be an unsafe and unsound banking practice and that banking organizations should generally pay dividends only out of current operating earnings federal reserve system federal reserve system regulations require depository institutions to maintain cash reserves against their transaction accounts primarily interestbearing and regular checking accounts the required cash reserves can be in the form of vault cash and if vault cash does not fully satisfy the required cash reserves in the form of a balance maintained with federal reserve banks frbs the board of governors of the federal reserve system generally makes annual adjustments to the tiered cash reserve requirements the regulations require that webster maintain cash reserves against aggregate transaction accounts in excess of the exempt amount of million at december effective january amounts greater than million up to and including million have a reserve requirement of and amounts in excess of million have a reserve requirement of webster bank is in compliance with these cash reserve requirements as a national bank and member of the federal reserve system webster bank is required to hold capital stock of the frb of boston the required shares may be adjusted up or down based on changes to webster banks common stock and paidin surplus webster bank was in compliance with these requirements with a total investment in frb of boston stock of million at december the frbs pay to member banks with total assets greater than billion a semiannual dividend equal to the lesser of or the yield on the 10year treasury note auctioned at the last auction prior to the dividend payment date for the semiannual period ended december the frb of boston declared a cash dividend equal to an annual yield of federal home loan bank system the federal home loan bank fhlb system provides a central credit facility for member institutions webster bank is a member of the fhlb of boston and is required to purchase and hold shares of capital stock in the fhlb for both membership and activitybased purposes capital stock requirements include an amount equal to of the aggregate principal amount of the banks unpaid residential mortgage loans and similar obligations at the beginning of each year up to a maximum of million plus an amount that varies from to depending on the maturities of its fhlb advances which totaled approximately billion at december webster bank was in compliance with these requirements with a fhlb stock investment of million at december on november the fhlb paid a quarterly cash dividend equal to an annual yield of source of strength doctrine federal reserve system policy requires bank holding companies to act as a source of financial and managerial strength to their subsidiary banks section of doddfrank codified the requirement that bank holding companies act as a source of financial strength as a result webster financial corporation is expected to commit resources to support webster bank including at times when webster financial corporation may not be in a financial position to provide such resources any capital loans by a bank holding company to any of its subsidiary banks are subordinate in right of payment to deposits and to certain other indebtedness of such subsidiary banks the us bankruptcy code provides that in the event of a bank holding companys bankruptcy any commitment by the bank holding company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of a subsidiary bank will be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to priority of payment in addition under the national bank act if the capital stock of webster bank is impaired by losses or otherwise the occ is authorized to require payment of the deficiency by assessment upon the holding company if the assessment is not paid within three months the occ could order a sale of the webster bank stock held by webster financial corporation to cover any deficiency capital adequacy the federal reserve system the occ and the fdic adopted capital rules in accordance with basel iii which generally implement the capital framework for strengthening international capital standards the capital rules define the components of regulatory capital as well as address other issues affecting the numerator in the regulatory capital ratios of a banking institution the capital rules also address asset risk weights and other matters affecting the denominator in the regulatory capital ratios of a banking institution the capital rules i include the capital measure common equity tier capital defined by basel iii capital rules cet1 capital and related regulatory capital ratio of cet1 to riskweighted assets ii specify that tier capital consists of cet1 capital and additional tier capital instruments meeting certain revised requirements iii mandate that most deductions or adjustments to regulatory capital measures be made to cet1 capital and not to the other components of capital and iv expand the scope of deductions from and adjustments to capital as compared to existing regulations under the capital rules for most banking organizations including webster the most common form of additional tier capital is noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and the most common forms of tier capital are subordinated notes and the qualifying portion of the allowance for loan and lease losses alll all subject to specific requirements of the capital rules tier capital to adjusted as defined average consolidated assets is known as the tier leverage ratio pursuant to the capital rules ratio thresholds are as follows table start adequately capitalized well capitalized cet1 riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital tier leverage capital table end the capital rules which became fully phasedin on january in addition to the minimum riskweighted asset ratios also include a capital conservation buffer composed entirely of cet1 capital the capital conservation buffer is designed to absorb losses during periods of economic stress banking institutions must hold a capital conservation buffer above its minimum riskbased capital requirements in order to avoid limitations on distributions such as dividends equity other capital instrument repurchases and certain discretionary bonus payments to executive officers based on the amount of any shortfall the capital standards applicable to webster and webster bank include an additional capital conservation buffer for which the lowest capital ratio excess over adequately capitalized must be at least the capital rules provide for a number of deductions from and adjustments to cet1 capital these include for example the requirement that mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets dtas and significant investments in nonconsolidated financial institutions be deducted from cet1 capital to the extent that any one such category exceeds of cet1 capital or all such items in the aggregate exceed of cet1 capital under the basel iii rule certain offbalance sheet commitments and obligations are converted into riskweighted assets that together with onbalance sheet assets are the base against which regulatory capital is measured the riskweighting categories are standardized for bank holding companies and banks based on a risksensitive analysis depending on the nature of the exposure risk weights range from for us government securities to for exposures such as certain tranches of securitization or certain equity exposures in september the federal banking agencies proposed simplifying the capital rules on july the federal banking agencies adopted a final rule replacing a substantially similar interim rule to simplify several requirements of the regulatory capital rules for nonadvanced approaches institutions such as the company the final rule simplifies the capital treatment for mortgage servicing assets certain deferred tax assets investments in the capital instruments of unconsolidated financial institutions and minority interests prompt corrective action and safety and soundness pursuant to section of the federal deposit insurance act federal banking agencies are required to take prompt corrective action should an insured depository institution fail to meet certain capital adequacy standards at each successive lower capital category an insured depository institution is subject to more restrictions and prohibitions including restrictions on growth restrictions on interest rates paid on deposits restrictions or prohibitions on payment of dividends and restrictions on the acceptance of brokered deposits furthermore if an insured depository institution is classified in one of the undercapitalized categories it is required to submit a capital restoration plan to the appropriate federal banking agency and the holding company must guarantee the performance of that plan prompt corrective action ratios are as follows table start well adequately under significantly capitalized capitalized capitalized undercapitalized cet1 riskbased capital total riskbased capital tier riskbased capital tier leverage capital table end based upon its capital levels a bank that is classified as well capitalized adequately capitalized or undercapitalized may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if the appropriate federal banking agency after notice and opportunity for hearing determines that an unsafe or unsound condition or practice warrants such treatment an insured depository institution with a ratio of tangible equity to total assets that is less than is considered critically undercapitalized bank holding companies and insured depository institutions may also be subject to potential enforcement actions of varying levels of severity by the federal banking agencies for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their business or for violation of any law rule regulation condition imposed in writing by the agency or term of a written agreement with the agency in more serious cases enforcement actions may include the issuance of directives to increase capital the issuance of formal and informal agreements the imposition of civil monetary penalties the issuance of a cease and desist order that can be judicially enforced the issuance of removal and prohibition orders against officers directors and other institution affiliated parties the termination of the insured depository institutions deposit insurance the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the insured depository institution and the enforcement of such actions through injunctions or restraining orders based upon a judicial determination that the fdic as receiver would be harmed if such equitable relief was not granted transactions with affiliates and insiders under federal law transactions between insured depository institutions and their affiliates are governed by sections and of the federal reserve act fra and federal reserve regulation w in a bank holding company context at a minimum the parent holding company of a bank and any companies which are controlled by such parent holding company are affiliates of the bank generally sections and of the fra are intended to protect insured depository institutions from losses arising from transactions with noninsured affiliates by limiting the extent to which a bank or its subsidiaries may engage in covered transactions with any one affiliate and with all affiliates of the bank in the aggregate and requiring that such transactions be on terms consistent with safe and sound banking practices further section 22h of the fra and its implementing regulation o restricts loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders or insiders under section 22h loans to insiders and their related interests may not exceed together with all other outstanding loans to such persons and affiliated entities the institutions total capital and surplus loans to insiders above specified amounts must receive the prior approval of the board of directors further under section 22h of the fra loans to directors executive officers and principal stockholders must be made on terms substantially the same as offered in comparable transactions to other persons except that such insiders may receive preferential loans made under a benefit or compensation program that is widely available to the banks employees and does not give preference to the insider over the employees section 22g of the fra places additional limitations on loans to executive officers consumer protection and consumer financial protection bureau supervision doddfrank centralized responsibility for consumer financial protection by creating the cfpb an independent agency charged with responsibility for implementing enforcing and examining compliance with federal consumer financial protection laws the company is subject to a number of federal and state laws designed to protect borrowers and promote lending to various sectors of the economy and population these laws include the equal credit opportunity act the fair credit reporting act the fair debt collection procedures act the truth in lending act the home mortgage disclosure act the real estate settlement practices act various state law counterparts and the consumer financial protection act of which is part of doddfrank doddfrank does not prevent states from adopting stricter consumer protection standards state regulation of financial products and potential enforcement actions could also adversely affect the companys business financial condition or operations the abilitytorepay provision of the truth in lending act requires creditors to make reasonable good faith determinations that borrowers are able to repay their mortgages before extending the credit based on a number of factors and consideration of financial information about the borrower from reasonably reliable thirdparty documents under doddfrank and the qualified mortgage provisions of the truth in lending act commonly known as the qualified mortgage qm rule loans meeting the definition of qualified mortgage are entitled to a presumption that the lender satisfied the abilitytorepay requirements the presumption is a conclusive presumptionsafe harbor for prime loans meeting qm requirements and a refutable presumption for higherpricedsubprime loans meeting qm requirements the qm definition incorporates the statutory requirements such as not allowing negative amortization or terms longer than years the qm rule also adds an explicit maximum debttoincome ratio for borrowers if the loan is to meet the qm definition though some mortgages that meet gse fha and va underwriting guidelines may for a period not to exceed seven years meet the qm definition without being subject to the debttoincome limits the cfpb is expected to continue to issue and amend rules implementing the consumer financial protection laws which may impact webster banks operations financial privacy and data security webster is subject to federal laws including the grammleachbliley act and certain state laws containing consumer privacy protection provisions these provisions limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to affiliated and nonaffiliated third parties and limit the reuse of certain consumer information received from nonaffiliated financial institutions these provisions require notice of privacy policies to consumers and in some circumstances allow consumers to prevent disclosure of certain nonpublic personal information to affiliates or nonaffiliated third parties by means of optout or optin authorizations the grammleachbliley act requires that financial institutions implement comprehensive written information security programs that include administrative technical and physical safeguards to protect consumer information federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines for establishing information security standards and programs to protect such information these guidelines along with related regulatory materials increasingly focus on risk management and processes related to information technology and the use of thirdparties in the provision of financial products and services the federal bank regulatory agencies expect financial institutions to establish lines of defense and to ensure that their risk management processes address the risk posed by compromised customer credentials and also expect financial institutions to maintain sufficient business continuity planning processes to ensure rapid recovery resumption and maintenance of the institutions operations after a cyber attack further pursuant to interpretive guidance issued under the grammleachbliley act and certain state laws financial institutions are required to notify customers of security breaches that result in unauthorized access to their nonpublic personal information in october the federal bank regulatory agencies issued proposed rules on enhanced cybersecurity riskmanagement and resilience standards that would apply to very large financial institutions and to services provided by third parties to these institutions the comment period for these proposed rules has closed and a final rule has not been published although the proposed rules would apply only to bank holding companies and banks with billion or more in total consolidated assets these rules could influence the federal bank regulatory agencies expectations and supervisory requirements for information security standards and cybersecurity programs of financial institutions with less than billion in total consolidated assets such as the company depositor preference the federal deposit insurance act provides that in the event of the liquidation or other resolution of an insured depository institution the claims of depositors of the institution including the claims of the fdic as subrogee of insured depositors and certain claims for administrative expenses of the fdic as a receiver will have priority over other general unsecured claims against the institution if an insured depository institution fails insured and uninsured depositors along with the fdic will have priority in payment ahead of unsecured nondeposit creditors including the parent bank holding company with respect to any extensions of credit they have made to such insured depository institution federal deposit insurance the fdics deposit insurance limit is per depositor per insured bank for each account ownership category substantially all of the deposits of webster bank are insured up to applicable limits by the dif of the fdic and are subject to deposit insurance assessments to maintain the dif the banks quarterly assessment is calculated using the fdics standardized riskbased assessment methodology determined by the fdic which multiplies the banks assessment base by its assessment rate the assessment base is defined as the average consolidated total assets less the average tangible equity of the bank the assessment rate is based on measures of the institutions capital adequacy asset quality management earnings liquidity and sensitivity to market risk commonly known as camels ratings which are certain financial measures to assess an institutions ability to withstand assetrelated stress and fundingrelated stress and a measure of loss severity that estimates the relative magnitude of potential losses to the fdic in the event of the banks failure the fdic also has the ability to make discretionary adjustments to the base assessment rate to reflect idiosyncratic quantitative and qualitative risk factors not captured in the fdics standardized riskbased assessment methodology under the federal deposit insurance act the fdic may terminate deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution has engaged in unsafe and unsound practices is in an unsafe or unsound condition to continue operations or has violated any applicable law regulation rule order or condition imposed by the fdic websters management is not aware of any practice condition or violation that might lead to the termination of its deposit insurance incentive compensation doddfrank required the federal banking agencies and the sec to establish joint regulations or guidelines for specified regulated entities with at least billion in total consolidated assets which includes the holding company and webster bank prohibiting incentivebased payment arrangements that encourage inappropriate risks by providing an executive officer employee director or principal shareholder with excessive compensation fees or benefits that could lead to material financial loss to the entity the federal banking agencies and the sec proposed regulations which have not yet been finalized if the regulations are adopted in the form initially proposed in they will restrict the manner in which executive compensation is presently structured community reinvestment act and fair lending laws webster bank has a responsibility under the cra as implemented by occ regulations to help meet the credit needs of its communities including low and moderateincome neighborhoods the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institutions discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community the occ examines webster banks record of compliance with the cra in addition the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act prohibit discrimination in lending practices on the basis of characteristics specified in those statutes webster banks failure to comply with the provisions of the cra could at a minimum result in regulatory restrictions on its activities and the activities of webster financial corporation webster banks failure to comply with the equal credit opportunity act and the fair housing act could result in enforcement actions against it by the occ as well as other federal regulatory agencies including the cfpb and the department of justice webster banks latest occ cra rating was outstanding on december the occ and the fdic issued a joint notice of proposed rulemaking to modernize the regulations implementing the cra the proposed rule if finalized will apply to all insured banks such as webster bank under the rulemaking the federal banking agencies intend to i clarify which activities qualify for cra credit ii update where activities count for cra credit iii create a more transparent and objective method for measuring cra performance and iv provide for more transparent consistent and timely crarelated data collection record keeping and reporting webster financial corporation and webster bank expect to monitor developments with respect to this rulemaking and assess the impact if any of changes to the cra regulations proposed by the federal banking agencies usa patriot act under title iii of the usa patriot act all financial institutions are required to take certain measures to identify their customers prevent money laundering monitor customer transactions and report suspicious activity to us law enforcement agencies financial institutions also are required to respond to requests for information from federal banking agencies and law enforcement agencies information sharing among financial institutions for the above purposes is encouraged by an exemption granted to complying financial institutions from the privacy provisions of the grammleachbliley act and other privacy laws financial institutions that hold correspondent accounts for foreign banks or provide private banking services to foreign individuals are required to take measures to avoid dealing with certain foreign individuals or entities including foreign banks with profiles that raise money laundering concerns and are prohibited from dealing with foreign shell banks and persons from jurisdictions of particular concern the primary federal banking agencies and the secretary of the treasury have adopted regulations to implement several of these provisions all financial institutions also are required to establish internal antimoney laundering programs the effectiveness of a financial institution in combating money laundering activities is a factor to be considered in any application submitted by the financial institution under the bank merger act webster has in place a bank secrecy act and usa patriot act compliance program and engages in very few transactions of any kind with foreign financial institutions or foreign persons office of foreign assets control regulation the united states government has imposed economic sanctions that affect transactions with designated foreign countries nationals and others these are typically known as the ofac rules based on their administration by the us treasury department office of foreign assets control the office of foreign assets controladministered sanctions targeting countries take many different forms generally they contain one or more of the following elements i restrictions on trade with or investment in a sanctioned country including prohibitions against direct or indirect imports from and exports to a sanctioned country and prohibitions on us persons engaging in financial transactions relating to making investments in or providing investmentrelated advice or assistance to a sanctioned country and ii a blocking of assets in which the government or specially designated nationals of the sanctioned country have an interest by prohibiting transfers of property subject to us jurisdiction including property in the possession or control of us persons blocked assets property and bank deposits cannot be paid out withdrawn set off or transferred in any manner without a license from the office of foreign assets control failure to comply with these sanctions could have serious legal and reputational consequences future legislative initiatives federal and state legislatures may
