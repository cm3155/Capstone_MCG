we reported earnings per share of which included per share of notable items excluding notables earnings per share totaled our balance sheet remains strong we are maintaining our throughthecycle underwriting discipline and seeing the benefits of our multiyear investments in digital technology and payments ecosystem in the form of strong fee growth across our business lines importantly we continued to accrete capital this quarter our cet1 ratio ended the period at and our return on tangible common equity ratio was on an adjusted basis slide provides additional performance metrics on both a reported and adjusted basis on slide ill provide some additional highlevel observations for the quarter starting with the balance sheet credit quality metrics continue to develop in line with our expectations and we achieved healthy growth in tangible book value per share on both a linked quarter and yearoveryear basis loan and deposit growth remains under pressure for the industry and that dynamic impacted our net interest income this quarter our nii on a taxable equivalent basis of approximately billion was within our guidance albeit on the lower end of the range we are seeing good opportunities for loan growth in targeted portfolios and notably we continue to see consumer deposit growth despite the impact of qt on industry deposit levels us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 over the past few weeks the outlook for potential rate cuts in has meaningfully changed as longterm rates have backed up client behavior across the industry is adjusting in response to the potential higherforlonger interest rate environment that has impacted our deposit mix and pressure deposit costs as a result we now expect our nii for the full year to be lower than anticipated however we are taking a closer look at our expense base given these nearterm nii headwinds and plan to take actions to mitigate the impact of lower than expected nii to our overall profitability john will go into more details on these topics but importantly we believe this is a nearterm phenomena turning to slide we continue to feel good about the momentum across our differentiated fee businesses fee income represents about of our total net revenue which stands to position us well in a lower interest rate environment overall we are encouraged by our current trends in our client growth and penetration rates as evidenced by the continued strength we have seen across many of our fee revenue businesses this quarter slide provides an update on our differentiated payments ecosystem over the past few years we have made good progress to both expand our business banking and payments relationships and grow related revenue associated with these relationships you may recall we discussed an opportunity to grow small business relationships by to and related revenue by to a few years ago as you can see on this slide were making good progress and see even greater opportunity to further expand these relationships and related revenue in the medium term let me now turn the call over to john who will provide more detail on the quarter as well as provide forward looking guidance john c stern senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy on slide we provide an earnings summary this quarter we reported diluted earnings per share of or per share after adjusting for notable items including the last of merger and integration costs of million following our acquisition of union bank and million related to anticipated increase in the fdic special assessment turning to slide total average loans were billion down linked quarter as growth was impacted by slow industry loan demand in the current higher interest rate environment despite tightening monetary policy and ongoing pressure on industrywide deposits our total average deposits of billion were stable linked quarter as we continue to see our efforts to grow consumerrelated deposits materialize endofperiod deposit growth was a little higher than we would typically see in the first quarter trust and corporate deposit inflows are seasonally higher at the end of the first quarter however the impact of holiday timing at quarter end delayed planned outflows of institutional deposits which resulted in temporarily higher cash levels we expect deposit outflows to move in line with more typical seasonal patterns importantly we continue to proactively manage the balance sheet by prioritizing opportunities that exceeded our cost of capital and further optimized our funding mix we continued to limit our reliance on shortterm borrowings and remain disciplined on deposit rate paid as we focus on relationshipbased deposits turning to slide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately billion down linked quarter and net interest margin declined basis points to both net interest income and net interest margin declines were driven by continued unfavorable deposit mix shift and deposit pricing pressure as well as slower loan demand us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 slide highlights trends in noninterest income noninterest income increased or million on a year overyear basis driven by higher payments revenue continued strength in underlying capital markets activity and stronger mortgage banking fees on a linkedquarter basis noninterest income as adjusted decreased or million reflective of seasonal declines in payments volume and previously discussed impacts related to the exiting of our atm cash provisioning business which pressured service charges and lower tax credit syndication fees which impacted other revenue turning to slide reported noninterest expense for the quarter totaled billion which included approximately million of notable items noninterest expense as adjusted decreased million or on a linkedquarter basis and million or yearoveryear driven by both cost synergies with union bank and our continued focus on operational efficiency slide highlights our credit quality performance asset quality metrics continue to develop in line with our expectations linked quarter nonperforming assets increased reflecting continued stress in our commercial real estate office portfolio and one idiosyncratic commercial loan the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at march compared with at december and a year ago our first quarter net chargeoff ratio of increased basis points from a fourth quarter level of and was higher when compared to a first quarter level of as adjusted our allowance for credit losses as of march totaled billion or of period end loans turning to slide our common equity tier ratio of as of march was reflective of a 10basispoint increase from year end which included basis points of net capital accretion offset by a cecl transitional impact of basis points we remain well above our regulatory capital minimum requirements i will now provide forwardlooking guidance on slide we expect net interest income for the second quarter on an fte basis to be relatively stable with the first quarter level of approximately billion full year net interest income on an fte basis is now expected to be in the range of billion to billion our revised guidance reflects a shift in commercial client deposit behavior in a higherforlonger rate environment and heightened competitive industry dynamics for the full year we continue to expect midsingledigit growth in noninterest income given the pressure we are seeing on net interest income we are reducing our expense guidance for the year we now expect full year noninterest expense of billion or lower which compares to billion in let me now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john we have been preparing for a wide range of economic scenarios for some time now and we continue to deliver industryleading returns despite the current industry stress our diverse business mix is allowing us to differentiate in a competitive market and we are seeing the benefit of the investments weve made and continue to make in our digital capabilities our technology modernization and our payments ecosystem the message id like to leave you with is that we will successfully navigate through the nearterm challenges the industry is facing but more importantly we are well positioned for the future and continue to manage the company with a longterm lens us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 let me close by recognizing the many dedicated employees for all they do to support the constituents of our national banking franchise it is because of our exceptional talent pool that we remain poised to execute on our capitalefficient growth objectives and continue to deliver the financial performance our shareholders have come to expect we will now open up the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning scott john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you for taking the question was hoping either andy or john you could talk just in a little more detail about sort of the nuance in the tougher nii guide for the full year so i guess at an industry level weve got a couple dynamics at play whether its the challenging loan growth environment or of course the impact of higherforlonger on deposit costs and beta so maybe the main one or two kind of pressure points you saw and then i guess as the followup it doesnt feel like therell necessarily be a lot more pressure on nii its just that it might not advance in the second half thats the way to think about it john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure scott good morning thanks for the question so maybe just take a step back just to answer your question in january when we talked about our guidance we looked at and we expected our net interest income to be in line with the annualized fourth quarter number given that was past mub actions that we had taken throughout the course of the year and so to your point were to lower than that that new guide with our new guidance here and the outlook really speaks to changes or the dynamics that we have in the economy the interest rate environment the dynamics in the deposit environment those sorts of things the conversation of course has shifted at the beginning of the year there was multiple cuts now were shifting to more higherforlonger and what weve witnessed over that time is that our client behavior particularly in the corporate and midmarket sections have been shifting their behavior and clients are continuing to rotate out of lowcost deposits into highercost deposits us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 and the pace of this action is slowing we absolutely see that its just not slowing as fast as what we would have anticipated so to boil that all together what we do see now with our guidance is that we have the second quarter net interest income will be relatively stable and we should see growth in the second half of the year and weve provided a range given that uncertainty in terms of client behavior and things of that variety and the final thing i would just say is that we recognized this upfront and were taking action we are looking at our expense base and taking action and pulling some levers that we have been looking at and so thats kind of how we think about the guidance from a bigpicture perspective andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john and scott id just add that we continue to look for opportunities to improve efficiencies particularly in this higherforlonger rate environment so we benefited from the million cost takeouts from the union bank transaction and we continue to focus on additional efficiencies in areas like procurement and thirdparty spend our workplace management and our properties and real estate and probably the area of greatest emphasis is operational efficiencies as we centralize our operations activities and technology investments weve made to really improve the effectiveness and efficiency in how we deliver our products and services so that will continue to be a focus and a lens for us and those are the actions were taking r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you very much andy and john andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess maybe just following up on nii john if we could drill a little bit into it one the securities yield went down basis point sequentially just remind us of the dynamic both in terms of the security book and fixed rate asset repricing that we should be mindful of going forward and then noninterestbearing deposits i think saw a big surge at the end of the quarter again whats the right way to think about nib balances and mix as we look forward thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so maybe ill start with your first question on the securities yield it was relatively flat or down basis point as you cited this quarter was a little bit different we had taken some hedging actions that actually offset some of the asset churn that we typically would see and so i would view this as more of a temporary thing as i look forward the typical churn that you see in asset repricing of that book as a reminder we developed billion per quarter that is rolling off at the lower level and well replace and so thats really going to be what were looking at kind of going forward so i just look at this as an anomaly on the deposit side yeah we did i believe your question was on the surge in deposits we did see a surge at the end of the quarter there was a holiday in there a lot of customers placed balances with us very much temporary a lot of those balances kind of hung on in and out here through tax season and so we typically have that its just higher than what we would typically see for various reasons and so as weve mentioned in our comments we expect that to get to more seasonal levels and then just your followon was really on the noninterestbearing side of things its continuing to trend down that mix of nib versus total deposits were kind of in that category right now as were in a higherforlonger its possible that continues to drift lower just based on the dynamics that were seeing in the marketplace ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just separately around outlook for fee revenues i think andy addressed that in his prepared remarks but give us a sense of any what areas youre seeing momentum on the fee revenue side and whether theres any room for sort of upside surprise if we get additional negative guide down on nii thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah sure so i mean overall we feel very were pleased with the quarter one results we saw good account growth were deepening relationships we continue to see progress on union and the growth opportunities that we see there consumer spending metrics all the underlying metrics are strong capital markets activities are strong and that is supportive of our continual view on midsingle digit growth on the fee aspect of things areas that we see growth we particularly have seen that in the capital market space we have extremely strong fixed income capital markets activity a lot of issuance that came to market and our franchise absolutely benefited from that mortgage has continued to be strong in terms of even though applications and production has been lower on a yearoveryear basis were actually seeing much wider spreads just given the areas that were focusing on and thats just the constant theme of how were focusing on more return on equity or higher returns overall us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 and then the payments business continues to do well and be in line with our expectations and so that helps to support the payments ecosystem that we have and all the initiatives and investment that weve made over time so all that is very much coming together and we feel very comfortable about our fee outlook ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks ebrahim operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research your line is open john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp how are you thinking about the outlook for net chargeoffs and provision and just kind of the credit trends you saw this quarter john you mentioned there was the one idiosyncratic commercial other than that kind of what are you seeing and youre still kind of thinking about a mid kind of net chargeoff outlook for this year that would be helpful thanks terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah john this is terry let me take that question so when we end up looking at credit again credit generally is pretty strong i think that were continuing to see in nonperforming assets that that will continue to tick up and did tick up in the first quarter its primarily related to commercial real estate office space and i think when we think about kind of the rest of the year probably in the second quarter its going to tick up a bit more but then that growth rate its going to really moderate quite a bit the thing to keep in mind with respect to commercial real estate office space is that weve aggressively reserved for that we feel like weve adequately covered the loss content thats in that portfolio so even though npas are likely to tick up we dont see that as a real impact from a pl standpoint from a chargeoff point of view in the first quarter thats principally driven by just credit cards and our expectation is that that will probably in the second quarter also come up but then on a fullyear basis the charge off rate that we would expect in credit cards is probably going to move up a bit in the second quarter and then us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 start to moderate downward again on a fullyear basis we would expect that chargeoff rate to be pretty similar to the chargeoff rate that we see in the first quarter of about john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay got it and then for the overall company kind of still kind of trending to that mid perhaps on the chargeoffs terrance r dolan a vice chair chief administration officer us bancorp yeah i would say mid maybe closer to the basis points and again i think that its going to be a little bit lumpy because of just timing of commercial real estate chargeoffs that will occur through the year but again we feel like weve adequately reserved for it john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp got it okay great and then andy how are you thinking about the expense once you mentioned offsetting the nii i guess within reason youre going to flex the expenses depending on the revenue environment plays out through the year andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah john so it is an environment that its always important to look at efficiencies and thats something were very focused on and it is in those areas we talked about well continue to flex where we see opportunities weve centralized operations we have our other opportunities in spend its a companywide initiative and well continue to focus on that again importantly though i want to tell you john that were still investing but were looking at operational efficiencies as we deliver our products and services while continued investments because investments weve made is helping us with the efficiencies on a goforward basis john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 welcome back betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much so i had a followup on the comments around corporate behavior in the deposit shift from nib i just want to understand two things one do you see your corporate deposits shifting from nib to ib or is it more nib to mmf and then separately typically corporates are in nib because its compensating balances for other services so as the shift is going on does it suggest that were going to see an uptick in say for example treasury services or any of the other fee lines john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp hey betsy its john thanks for that so in terms of the behavior i think what were seeing is the trends are slowing the rotation is going maybe first to answer your question more from nib into more ib its more of a its the tradeoff for the client and what were seeing really there is clients are just optimizing and being as just looking at their balance sheet looking at their balances especially in this higher rate environment and now that they know its going to be here for a longer period of time theyre taking a closer eye to it were just seeing that more and more so the trends have been slowing of that mix shift its just taking longer than what we would have anticipated so in terms of compensating balances those are the things that are on a casebycase basis with the clients we look at the ecr rates that we pay and customers will then make decisions based on that and so those are kind of the tradeoffs that we see relative to that right now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so treasury services potentially could see a little popup in growth as how you pay for services changes or is that an overreach john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp its possible but again the dynamics pretty fluid is kind of how i would describe it betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and also folks are staying on your balance sheet as opposed to going off balance sheet into nii john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thats right yeah a lot of this is defending the clients and making sure were there for them again we view this as a temporary phenomenon its just a timing thing its really just the churn here is continuing its just being the pace of it is taking a little bit longer for it to stabilize than what we would have anticipated and thats really whats going on here we want to make sure were here for the long run for our clients and serving them as we kind of transition through this rate environment us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thats super helpful and then just kind of foot question here just could you help us understand how you are currently thinking about the asset sensitivity of us bancorp at this stage how should we think about what higherforlonger means for you for the whole organization thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah sure so i think in terms of asset sensitivity from a risk management perspective we are as neutral as you can be weve taken a lot of different actions to make sure because we just dont know where the rate environment is i mean it was seven cuts at the beginning of the year the market had now its closer to zero so we just want to make sure we are prepared for different type of rate environments and so i think as we think about the asset sensitivity that is really how were positioning ourselves as we think about higherforlonger and what that means the drivers there are going to be clearly deposit betas and rate and paid and all that sort of thing they creep up the offset to that is were going to asset churn on the loan side as well as the investment portfolio side and over time those things will offset and turn ultimately in our favor but its going to be that timing thats really going to matter in terms of what are those things move and shift over time andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so betsy as john said this is andy weve tried to narrow the corridor of volatility given the uncertainty in the outlook and so we are about as neutral as we can be given all the puts and takes john talked about betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc super thank you so much really appreciate it andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks betsy john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin of jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning if i could ask a couple questions on the fee side one can we just talk a little bit through the payments businesses looks like the overall yearoveryear growth rate was i think youre aspiring for uppersingle digits it looks like corporate was down yearoveryear and maybe the rate in merchant us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 slowed a little bit so can you just talk us through some of those dynamics and then how youd expect that to traject going forward john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure yeah i think thanks ken i appreciate that we can look at maybe ill take them in order merchant was kind of in that area as you mentioned on the fee side of things on that side this quarter we saw travel being a little bit down but the other underlying metrics really had strong growth we saw our techled initiatives really continue to propel very nicely we saw highsingle digit for virtually all the other categories in that space so we think the travel is a its just kind of a shortterm nature thing here and were well positioned and continue to feel good about highsingle digits there on the corporate payment side as you mentioned that was negative over this yearoveryear basis but we are lapping the freight weight that has happened over the past year and that will really churn there might be a little bit more of that in the second quarter but we see strong momentum as we look again the fundamentals of business spend and things like that are continuing to be in case so we feel good about highsingle digits and then on the card side really strong fee growth good spreads payment rates and payment spend trends constructive for how were thinking about it so all that we feel good about all the underlying trends from a payments standpoint ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then just in terms of some of the other lines corporate services and mortgage did a lot better i think you mentioned dcm and corporate and better gain on sale just wondering are those both sustainable or was there any pullforward on both of those areas this quarter john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp i think it is i think the underlying strength maybe had a little bit of positivity here in the first quarter but underlying all that i think the gain on sale in the markets that were playing is legitimate even though that market has been slower from an application standpoint and production standpoint its still kind of double digit almost down from yearoveryear so theres just theres a lot of the volumes are lower but the spreads are wider and we anticipate that to continue going forward ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and last cleanup one just that atm business it didnt look like service charges changed is it that close and i know its not a net profit i know its neutral net profit but can you just update us on that thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah there was some of that in this quarter and so theyll kind of fully run off here in the second quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 with an offsetting costs john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yes ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning mike john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi another one on hi another one on net interest income andy you used the word temporary in your opening remarks talking about either the decline or the worse guide and i didnt know what you meant by temporary andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so what were saying mike is that this pressure that as john described we believe is going to dissipate and has dissipated its just dissipating slower than we thought and we expect relatively stable in the second quarter and then growth in the back half of so thats what i meant by temporary mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc do you have any expectation for and where the floor is for noninterestbearing deposits or any other color andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so i would expect that will continue the momentum that we see in the second half of were not going to give a guide right now because its so volatile in terms of what rates could be but importantly mike we see the second half of even in a lower rate cut environment and higherforlonger to start to go up mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i know ive asked this before but it still applies i think so the big picture here is youve got million of savings in the union bank acquisition so thats good for the expenses the revenues you highlight in your slide us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 business banking is up onethird over three years in terms of revenues and relationships you have mortgage you have capital markets you have payments the revenues are working the expenses are working and then we look at the efficiency ratio for this quarter and the core number is like around for a company that for so long had an efficiency ratio under now i know youre investing a lot nationally we heard that at the ph bat conference but its just like when do you get under and i get the nii effect that distorts things but you do have some peers that are under now so how should we think about efficiency at us bancorp andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah mike thats why were pulling these expense levers and looking at continuing to create efficiency so i feel very positive about our fee categories we have a diversified set of businesses a lot of businesses that other banks dont have like payments and commercial products fund services corporate trust that helps us drive fee revenue thats the strength that we talked about that there are some headwinds on margin for the industry and for ourself well get past those headwinds and well continue to operate efficiently and look for expense levers to get that efficiency ratio downward and thats an objective of ours mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore your line is open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning morning on the deposit growth in the quarter the surge in growth you saw on end of period can you maybe size up the impact that was more seasonal and more tied to the holiday dynamic and how much that could pull back and then separately also on your nii commentary you did mention the competitive landscape shifting is that just regarding the deposit mix and pricing or youre also seeing some competitive dynamics impacting you on the loan front thanks john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp hey john thanks maybe to answer your second question first its more of the deposit mix and rate paid its not necessarily the loan side i think actually on the loan side we see even though loans are soft at this point we us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 do see decent momentum on the commercial side we saw good periodend growth there spreads are good the asset churn is positive all there i think its just again its back on the deposit side of things and the mix and i would say even on the mix i would say on the commercial side its just a rotational thing the rates environment really hasnt changed in the commercial side on the retail side sometimes rates go up sometimes down depending on geography and market and all those sorts of things but were competitive there and we want to make sure weve been growing and we have been growing weve been growing consumer deposits as we mentioned back on your first question on the deposit surge its probably in the area of billion to billion that we received we get a lot of inflow at the end of the quarter as people prepare for outflowing payments end of the month type payments or first of the month as well as 5th of the month and then sometimes they just hold it all the way through the tax season thats exactly what weve seen here is that you get this kind of surge up at the end of the quarter it holds for the duration through tax day and then it starts to wind down thats been very seasonal its just a bigger number than what we have typically seen john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thank you and then separately on the expense efforts that where youre taking a closer look and you mentioned some of the areas are those measures that youve taken fully reflected in that updated expense outlook of billion for the year or could your efforts drive a somewhat lower number as you evaluate the opportunity andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so john theyre reflected in the efforts thats why we brought it down to million in the note youll see that says billion at least so we could pull additional levers as we continue to focus on this but it is reflected in the guidance john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks for taking my questions andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i just want to probe andy a comment that you expect net interest income to go up in the second half of could you talk a little bit about what you see as the drivers of that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp im going to let john start and ill add on john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah the driver is really vivek as we talked about it comes down to the deposit side of things really first and foremost and again were seeing the migration and rotation slow again its just taking some time so eventually as that goes that will stabilize and then youre going to have the continual asset churn on both loans as well as investment portfolio things like that i would also say that weve taken a lot of action to enhance return on equity were looking at capital efficient ways to grow that those underlying themes continue the union growth opportunities that we see and loan spreads have been favorable so those are kind of the reasons that we see a positive nature and bend to the net interest income that andy talked about andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so as john said its the repricing of loans the expectation of stabilization of the flow of deposits and the securities portfolio churn that we talked about vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and the hedge that you did which you said was an anomaly this quarter could you talk a little bit about that was that for thats not going to have an ongoing impact was that just something that you put on for capital protection or what was it john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure yeah so it really was more again our asset sensitivity continue to be neutral so those are actions that we took kind of as a onetime matter so its in the rate and goforward thats why i called it as a temporary measure here in this quarter going forward again the driver here in the investment portfolio is the billion or so thats rolling off at lower yields and will be replaced at now current higher interest rates vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it because you had always said you were neutral so thats why i was trying to understand what sort of change to make that you had to do to make it go to neutral us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah those are part of the actions that we take to get neutral and those are the things that the team looks at on a frequent basis were actively managing that on a daily basis were looking at markets were taking actions and this is just the result of that vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and is that what just receive fix swaps you added or terminated or what did you do john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well specifically they were just they were pay fix swaps that we had terminated they were shorter dated in nature but it reduced the yield because the pay fix carry was had been gone but that just neutralized our interest rate sensitivity vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning andy good morning john andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc john and andy can you share with us obviously you had a nice move up in your cet1 ratio its now at and we all know the basel iii endgame is coming nobody knows for certain when that final proposal will be in place but it seems like for the category ii and iii banks that the unrealized securities losses will be carried through regulatory capital which is not the case today of course so with that as a backdrop can you update us on where you want that cet1 ratio and historically you guys have been so good at giving back to of your annual earnings in dividends and buybacks and when do you think we could possibly get back on that kind of track john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure gerard ill start first of all just to give an update on the unrealized loss so from a positive standpoint part of the hedging and activities that we do that i just talked about in prior questions really help here because we had us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 even though rates went up basis points basis points throughout the quarter our aoci was fairly neutral and so the impact to the aoci from the investment portfolio and pension right now is about basis points versus the that we have on common equity tier youre right the basel iii endgame and all those sorts of things that along with i would call ccar results for us are two important milestones we need to see before we make any grand declarations on what our capital ratios will be going forward in the meantime well continue to build our capital levels and what well also do is focus on our returns obviously the dividend is a large priority additional priority is investing in the company and so were pausing on share repurchases at this time as we build the capital over time we will normalize back to kind of where we were but this is kind of that transitional period that were in gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and coming back to stepping back for a moment now that the union bank i assume is fully integrated obviously that has been your focus since that acquisition can you share with us your thoughts about de novo expansion you had that expansion down in the charlotte area is there more to come now that again the acquisition is behind you whats your thoughts there as you look out over the next to months andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah gerard were focused on building our core customer base and deepening the relationships with the customers we have through the set of products and services that we offer we do that through a number of mechanisms one of them is through our branch system one of them is through our relationship managers and working together and that de novo effort is doing well we also have partnerships with state farm which increase our distribution base so well continue to look at all those levers but the bottom line is that we continue to focus on more customers deeper relationships across the diverse set of businesses that we have and a lot of the opportunity gerard is providing more services to customers who already are customers of us bank and could benefit from some of the other products and services that we offer gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and andy just a quick followup on that deepening customer relationship that you just identified when it comes to your middle market commercial or your core commercial account if they only have a loan relationship versus one of your preferred accounts that have multiple relationships that deepening you just mentioned what kind of profit differential would you estimate there is between a customer that only has a loan versus your customer that has multiple products andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp its significantly higher the more relationships the higher the return the more revenue certainly so if they have a loan only versus a loan plus deposit plus treasury management plus commercial products plus payments it all adds up gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 yeah no i agree okay thank you appreciate it andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator operator instructions your next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please ask your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc theres obviously a lot of puts theres obviously a lot of puts and takes like as you think about the net interest margin over time but weve seen a number of banks put out kind of this mediumterm nim target and wondering if you have any thoughts on what a more sustainable nim is for you guys you talked about the securities kind of cash flowing billion i dont know if there is any kind of underwater swap that our churn can roll off but i guess the question is what do you think about nim kind of medium term versus where you are right now john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah ill start here matt in terms of the net interest margin its going to obviously track net interest income over time but it may bounce around some of the drivers of that obviously can be some of the things you just mentioned the asset churn on the investment portfolio the creepin on deposit costs and things like that but cash levels and liquidity mix and things of that variety can also drive it as well so we dont really have a call or a base of heres where our net interest margin were more focused on net interest income matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then are there any again the securities book youre pretty clear on the cash flow there and i think thats fairly long duration from a cash flow perspective any swaps that we should be mindful of that could go either way looking out the next couple years john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp im sorry matt i didnt andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 indiscernible swaps so again you go ahead john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp the swap activity that we have yeah so just as a our hedging while were very active in our hedging activities theres really no fundamental change we continue to focus on payfixed swaps that hedged the investment portfolio obviously we took some off that impacted but thats a temporary thing we still have well over well over a third actually of our risk hedged on the securities book and then we have been adding receivefixed swaps as well some of that spot some of that forward starting depending on the nature as the curve has come up here and the curve has flattened and higher thats an excellent opportunity for us to add some protection for the downside if and when that does occur and all that adds up to be kind of in that net neutral interest rate risk position that were in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp thanks matt operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with hsbc your line is open saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi thanks good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc i guess another one on nii your guidance does assume some modest reacceleration of nii in the back end i think second half nii is at the midpoint higher than the first half but whats embedded in can you be more specific about whats embedded in the throughthecycle deposit beta assumption and john you mentioned noninterest bearing could continue to move down a little bit from how far could whats your best guess now as to how much more deposit migration and where that ultimately could land at and whats sort of embedded in the guidance for those measures us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure saul its john so on the beta side specifically that has continued to slow i think were only up or points here this quarter and it was points in the prior quarter so it clearly has slowed and as i mentioned deposit rates in the commercial side are very flat they have not changed retail bounces around a little bit and were going to be competitive and follow the market there of course but all in if youre higherforlonger it may creep up a point here or two but we feel like the low is probably the right place for that to be as we kind of look forward saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay and in terms of noninterest bearing the total liability or the total deposits where it is indiscernible john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i think that saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc indiscernible john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah as i mentioned a little bit on the noninterestbearing side were about customers are being more efficient and things like that it could go down a couple points as we stay a little bit lower or at this higherfor longertype period saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay great and i guess a followup on just a clarification on the deposit surge your response to an earlier question on the deposit surge forgive me if i missed this but the billion to billion surge thats a normal surge in noninterestbearing deposits but i guess the question is whats sort of the incremental to the normal surge what was incremental this quarter to what you normally see im just trying to get a base on which to forecast noninterestbearing deposits going forward john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp sure so in terms of the surge the surge in absolute terms was like it was about billion or so its probably 10orso billion dollars above and beyond what we typically see or this type for the quarter saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay okay all right thats helpful thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just kind of still a cleanup on nii just in very simple terms if youre neutral to rates why is the guide lower for nii i just want to make sure i have that indiscernible something happen that you didnt expect or you werent fully neutral before this quarter john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah sure mike its john so the yes we are neutral to answer your question to shocks to interest rates i think what were explaining is the behavioral aspect of it which sometimes can be a little more challenging to judge at that point in time and so again its a little bit the pace of rotation is a little bit its slowing down just not as much as what we had anticipated so again rate shocks moving up and down we continue to feel very good from a neutral standpoint its just that behavioral aspect that weve been talking about here mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and do you have a number for fixed asset repricing say to the end of next year because i think thats whats driving your higher guide for the second half this year and into next year so youve talked about billion of securities but by the end of next year how much do you have in fixed asset that should reprice do you have like one grand number for that john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp well i think the way i would think about it is about half of our loan book is fixed rate component the other half is floating rate component and spreads are widening so you can see some of the floating rate components perhaps improve over time were seeing decent growth in payments or excuse me credit card and so some of the mix is also working at play here and so commercial loans are coming on theyre coming on at wider spreads so thats kind of how i think about that from a bigpicture perspective mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last one loan spreads i mean for a while there it looks like were heading into the recession and loan spreads were not widening now it looks like were not having a recession and you have tight spreads in the capital markets and loan spreads are widening just why are loan spreads widening now i guess that would be an incremental positive john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 yeah so i think its just different markets so i think some of the drag youre seeing in the commercial volume side is capital markets spreads have been and the access has been very good we saw that reflected in our fixed income capital market fees and things of that variety but i think that has taken away volume to a certain extent in other areas where access to capital markets isnt as pronounced i would say there has been decent opportunity for spreads there mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you hey john just quick followup to make sure we get this right the surge deposits that came in i think you mentioned you expect about billion to leave is all of that going out of noninterest bearing so the billion number does that go into the mid as we think about the second quarter john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp no some of this is temporary so the surge that happens it can be a mix of both money market as well as nib it may surge the nib for a brief period of time but its not going to be material to the quarter so the surge that weve been talking about can be a mix of both ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc mix of both and so you do expect just from a very dollar balance standpoint nib staying north of billion is that fair john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i would expect as we said the rotation is continuing so i wouldnt expect growth necessarily in dda but deposits overall we do expect to basically be stable ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and just a separate question given all these questions on nii i think i would love to hear the degree of conservatism baked into your nii outlook because i guess the concern were hearing is whether we see another downward guide three months from now yeah so in terms of what would go wrong in order for us to see another guide down on nii for you to be surprised thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 17apr2024 john c stern a senior executive vice president chief financial officer us bancorp yeah ebrahim i dont look at it as conservative or aggressive its just the range the range that we provided just given the uncertainty thats just in the market given all the factors that weve talked about here today ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator there are no further questions at this time mr andersen i turn the call
