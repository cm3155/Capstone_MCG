executive officer us bancorp thanks george good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call ill begin on slide in the third quarter we reported diluted earnings per share of and generated total net revenue of billion the quarter was highlighted by strong growth in net interest income good momentum across several fee business initiatives and continued expense discipline which supported modest positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis compared with the third quarter of last year our return on tangible common equity was this quarter turning to slide revenue growth on a linkedquarter basis was driven by improved spread income from more favorable loan mix continued fixed asset repricing proactive and disciplined liability management as well as strategic actions taken on our investment securities portfolio john will provide more detail on these action in his prepared remarks on the upper righthand side of the slide you will see that nonperforming assets the net chargeoff ratio and latestage delinquency metrics were all relatively stable compared with the second quarter levels at september our common equity tier capital ratio was an increase of basis points from last quarter driven by continued earnings accretion our tangible book value per share increased to a improvement linkedquarter and an higher than last year slide provides key performance metrics this quarter our return on average assets increased to the efficiency ratio improved to and net interest margin expanded basis points to turning to slide we continue to see good momentum across many of our fee businesses this quarter we achieved yearoveryear doubledigit growth in both commercial and investment products revenue driven by underlying capital markets activity and wallet share gains across our targeted industry verticals additionally we also saw good yearoveryear growth in trust and investment management payment services mortgage banking and treasury management fee revenues as we benefited from a combination of improved underlying market conditions deepening client relationships and expanded product set and expanded distribution channels let me now turn the call over to john wholl provide more detail on the quarter as well as forwardlooking guidance john c stern chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet summary followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends this quarter total average deposits decreased on a linkedquarter basis to billion as we continued to prioritize relationshipbased deposits and maintained our pricing discipline average loans totaled billion a modest decrease of on a linkedquarter basis industry loan growth remains muted and the decline we saw this quarter was driven by slightly lower commercial balances given continued headwinds from capital marketsrelated paydowns and continued relatively low utilization rates us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 within retail higher credit card loan balances and improved revolver rates drove more favorable loan mix and margins as andy mentioned this quarter we opportunistically restructured a portion of our investment portfolio to enhance our net interest income growth trajectory and to further strengthen our capital and liquidity profiles at september the ending balance on our investment portfolio declined slightly to billion with an average yield for the quarter of slide highlights our credit quality performance asset quality metrics continued to develop in line with our expectations and reflected ongoing macroeconomic stability this quarter we saw a slight reduction in our exposure to commercial real estate office portfolio which remained appropriately reserved at latestage delinquencies and nonperforming asset metrics were relatively flat on a linkedquarter basis and the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was unchanged at linkedquarter versus year overyear our net chargeoff ratio of increased basis points from a second quarter level of in line with our expectations at september our allowance for credit losses totaled billion or of periodend loans we expect our fourth quarter net chargeoff ratio to remain relatively stable compared with the third quarter level in the near term we expect changes to the loan loss reserve to be driven primarily by loan balance growth and mix slide provides a more detailed earnings summary in the third quarter we reported per diluted share which included million of net losses or million aftertax on sales and securities rebalancing actions within our investment portfolio these actions were largely offset by tax favorability in the quarter primarily due to settlements in various tax jurisdictions turning to slide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis totaled approximately billion an increase of linkedquarter our net interest margin increased basis points to both net interest income and net interest margin growth this quarter benefited from a combination of earning asset repricing and mix further supported by higher card revolve rates investment portfolio actions and disciplined deposit pricing slide highlights trends in noninterest income noninterest income totaled billion and as mentioned included million of net securities losses related to rebalancing activity within our investment portfolio importantly yearoveryear we saw good growth across our core business offerings including trust and investment management commercial products mortgage banking and investment products as a reminder last quarters mortgage banking fees included an approximately million gain on sale of mortgage servicing rights service charges decreased linkedquarter partly reflecting the impact of exiting our atm cash provisioning business the exit is now fully reflected in our run rate for the third quarter of turning to slide noninterest expense for the quarter totaled billion which was relatively flat to the prior quarter and lower than a year ago as adjusted the linkedquarter increase of million or was driven by a higher compensation and employee benefit expense primarily due to higher performancebased incentives on a yearoveryear basis the million decrease as adjusted was driven by prudent expense management initiatives and the identification of operational efficiencies across the company turning to slide our common equity tier ratio of as of september increased basis points from the second quarter looking ahead we intend to balance our continued capital accretion of basis points to basis points per quarter with capital distributions starting with a modest share repurchase in the near term us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 i will now provide forwardlooking guidance on slide we expect net interest income for the fourth quarter on an fte basis to be relatively stable to this quarters billion this guidance is reflective of our current expectation for more modest loan growth and continued qt impacts on deposits full year net interest income on an fte basis is expected to come in at the higher end of our billion to billion range for the full year we still expect midsingledigit growth in total noninterest income as adjusted but likely at the lower end of the range we expect full year noninterest expense as adjusted to be billion ill now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks john third quarter results showcase the resiliency of our unique and differentiated business model which featured solid top line revenue growth supported by healthy linkedquarter margin expansion as well as continued yearoveryear income momentum and steady expense discipline this quarter we reported modest operating leverage excluding net securities losses and prior year notable items and consistent with our message at investor day we expect to deliver expanding positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter that will continue into as recent industry headwinds become tailwinds and we realize the benefits of our now run rate investment spend on industryleading digital capabilities integrated payment solutions and continued technology modernization it will be the combination of our scale our interconnected business model and our deep and talented management team that will allow us to capitalize on the many objectives and targets at this important inflection point in our story as always let me close by thanking our over employees for their everyday commitment to our clients communities and shareholders well now open the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey john i guess i wanted to start with nii so at least relative to what i had anticipated looks like it came in better than you might have thought even as recently as a month or so ago at the investor day i guess just in sort of simple terms can you walk through what in your mind ended up coming in better than you might have anticipated john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure scott and good morning so a couple factors i would say there first i think the remixing of our portfolio we continue to see strength in our credit card and revolve rate as we discussed in our opening comments its great to see that business is even growing at yearoveryear on the loan side of things our fixed asset repricing continues and then the other factor i would just say is that on the what we didnt know is the fed was going to cut basis points and we had the ability to really price on our deposits and so i think the combination of all those things really helped us power and see nice momentum here in the third quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect and if i could switch gears to fees for just a second just wanted to chat about the sort of the implied fourth quarter number so even if we get to the lower end of the full year fee guide i guess that sort of implies that fourth quarter fees would get back up near sort of a billion billion level that might be more typical of one of your seasonally stronger quarters like typically i think of you all doing best in the second quarter maybe if you can just sort of walk through the main puts and takes and where you would see sort of a reacceleration in momentum into the fourth quarter please john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 sure so i think its just in a number of different things and as we discussed in our opening comments the core business components are performing quite well we had strong growth in trust commercial products was over doubledigits at mortgage had nice yearoveryear growth at and payments while it came in at or so this quarter we do have expectations of growth in those particular businesses in the fourth quarter so all that kind of leads into some momentum there from a fee standpoint so of course weve some headwinds there that weve talked about like exiting our atm business some of the prepaid card metrics and some of the other things like that in the payments but all in all thats what gets us and gives us confidence in our midsingledigit growth on the fee side of things r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from john pancari from evercore isi your line is now open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi i know you cited the partial securities repositioning in the quarter wanted to see if you could give us a little bit more color on what you restructured in the quarter and the sizing of that and the yield and then do you expect further actions on that front and would further actions already be factored into your nii expectations thanks john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure thanks john so in terms of the securities repositioning we did take action on what million of losses in total theres about billion in total of notional that was transacted but importantly for you all i mean we consider that more or less a twoyear payback is kind of how were thinking about it i would call the impact to the quarter maybe around million or so so theres probably a little bit more pickup in the fourth quarter related to it and as i think about in the future we dont have any other of these sorts of things contemplated in our guidance or anything like that its just this was an opportunity that came up with as we saw interest rates fall quite a bit we were able to take advantage of that and we feel good about the transaction were constantly looking at these things but we dont have anything contemplated at this particular point in time john pancari q analyst evercore isi us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 okay all right thank you and then separately on the expense side you put up some pretty good positive operating leverage this quarter and implied that fourth quarter youll see that as well and i believe at the investor day you expressed confidence in continued positive operating leverage as you look at can you maybe help us get a sense of the magnitude of that operating leverage that you think is reasonable as you enter and longer term i believe the street is looking at about basis points to basis points operating leverage next year wanted to get your thoughts on that as we look at your return profile in the coming years andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah thanks john this is andy so as you saw we reported positive operating leverage of approximately basis points in  here the guidance that john provided would indicate that our expectation for positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter of will be north of and we would expect it to continue to expand from there into so building upon that 1plus percent into exactly where well get well give more guidance as we give the forwardlooking guidance that we think about across the categories john pancari q analyst evercore isi great very helpful andy thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is now open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh hey good morning andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp hey betsy john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah just two one followup on that is in the guidance for you indicated expenses at billion and i know in the past you had been saying billion or less so is there anything we should take away from that very ever so slight guidance change john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 hey betsy its john so i think its just reflective of were in the third were complete with the third quarter were at the fourth quarter right now we have a very good line of sight into what our expense base will be and so we were just being more precise with that particular number in addition we saw good growth in our net interest income and so its kind of the expense was coupled in part with the net interest income youll recall we shifted our discussion points on that and since were at the higher end of our range we feel like billion is the appropriate expense side of things this quarter betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay no thats helpful and then on the rate discussion earlier you got the surprise basis points which you were able to pass through onto the depositor side so as were thinking about the next several quarters here does nim expand further as rates continue to come down or is there a catchup on the asset side that we should be skewing to john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp yeah i think broadly speaking rate cuts are a positive thing for us in the sense that we have a deposit base thats conducive really to cuts we have the ability as you know of our deposit base is in institutional and is retail were able to cut institutional rates fairly quickly and so the beta for this particular juncture was around that ill call it area for this particular cut and we expect that to continue to migrate closer to or up to just north of as we kind of get through the cycle and that sort of thing and so thats going to be helpful and i think the other thing is over time as the cuts happen then that implies a more upward sloping curve which should help us in our trajectory going forward as well so those are the two pieces that i would point to betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and the and thats on total ib deposits or total deposits which is ph nonlinear john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp total ib total interestbearing deposits betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes super thanks so much john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 you bet andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp betsy operator your next question comes from erika najarian from ubs your line is now open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just a few followup questions first on johns previous question gunjan kedia a president us bancorp sorry erika can you just were having a hard time hearing you erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc can you hear me better now john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp yeah thats better thank you erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc okay sorry about that just wanted to follow up on johns question you mentioned billion of notional was sold so that we can understand the impact for fourth quarter could you tell us what the average yield was of what was sold and what you invested in and just a followup to betsys line of questioning you said that you saw a beta and the terminal would be north of as we think about the fourth quarter is it a sort of a smooth glide path to that do you expect it to significantly accelerate from that initial beta john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure so maybe ill just take those in pieces the first one on the securities book i think it was just an opportunity there to remix in a couple different things and it was really there to improve our liquidity profile as well as some loweryielding securities that have seasoned to reposition those so it was just a number of different securities so its hard to just summarize it in one thing but i would just say on the beta side of things or so terminal beta i think that just is a gradual increase as we look forward and the reason for that is on the institutional side youre going to get that benefit on each cut on the retail side youre going to get that benefit kind of as i mentioned in the past kind of an arc to the retail pricing sort of thing and so as cds reprice and as the money market rates come down on retail thats going to be kind of that glide path into the terminal that i spoke to earlier us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp and john all of that all that you said which is spot on is all baked into your flat or stable net interest income projection for quarter four john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp thats exactly right yes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for you andy and this is sort of a broader question you hosted a very comprehensive investor day and i think the investor reception at least as it followed through to the stock was probably less than desired and as i think about the feedback from investors im wondering if you could sort of readdress this on this call you seem determined and you have showed us positive operating leverage maybe some quick notes on the comments on the southeast expansion was also hit on as a potential negative and the third would be youre now in a place where youre building capital loan growth hasnt yet come back what would allow you to be a little bit more aggressive more quickly on acting on that billion authority andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp so ill take them in pieces erika so first of all i thought the team did a terrific job articulating the strategy at investor day and part of that strategy was the inflection point discussion we talked about which is controlled expenses delivering on operating leverage and stronger revenue growth given the interconnectedness of the businesses and were hitting on all those and i think part of what the analyst community and investor community wants is examples and execution and this quarter we started that execution and as i said on operating leverage we expect that to expand into fourth quarter and into so were going to deliver on that secondly with regard to the ma environment given this environment large bank ma is not a priority for us thats not something were focused on what we are focused on is organic growth and the components that gunjan talked about and im going to ask her to just highlight some of those key aspects to that right now gunjan kedia a president us bancorp good morning erika as we shared during the investor day we do have very meaningful organic growth opportunities in our portfolio and as andy said our attention is very much on executing against those priorities deepening our client relationships enhancing our product interconnectivity and broadening our reach we are very focused on delivering meaningful positive operating leverage and the execution that goes with it we have optimized our distribution via investments in our digital capabilities and our southeast expansion is very much focused on our partnerships and our digital capabilities thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gunjan and then finally on your last question with regard to capital erika as you know as we talked about and as john articulated in his comments we would expect to go into some level of modest buybacks here shortly and then we would expect to build upon that once we have more clarity on basel iii and some of the us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 capital rules and then loan growth as you talked about is a key factor as well but given all that we would still expect to be at our capital targets even under the cat ii when weve crossed that threshold which again as a reminder and we talked about is not expected till erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i guess just to follow up on that the basel iii shouldnt impact you that much right and everybody had already put in the impact of aoci actually more immediately than whatever phasing basel iii endgame has i guess im wondering as a regional bank do you think youre just a prudent constituent in terms of not wanting to be aggressive ahead of a new set of revisions or are you also considering the ratings agencies just sort of wondering what the and i completely understand that youre about to buy back in the first quarter but i think that its probably an important component of longonly investors starting to increase their position in us bank andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah all those constituencies you talked about are factors in our thinking loan growth the final capital rules the rating agencies those are all factors but were very confident in our accretion ability you just saw this quarter basis points weve articulated basis points to basis points were very comfortable with our capital position and were very comfortable with the ability to start to buy back and distribute as well as accrete the level of which well continue to determine and judge over time given all those factors you talked about erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you andy andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp you bet erika see you operator your next question comes from mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi hey good morning first a cleanup question so are you interested in buying a bank in the southeast because indiscernible just following up to the prior question andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp no us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc not even a small bank andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp mike the environment right now is just not conducive theres too much uncertainty for ma and i dont want to focus all our efforts on that when we have so much opportunity on the organic growth front so in this role what you do is prioritize against the opportunity set that you have in front of you and our organic growth opportunities are far more important and much more tangible to us right now and as you know mike the ma environment is just so uncertain right now that would not be a good place to focus our efforts mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so my main question here it goes back to the operating leverage which is how much of this is expenses versus revenues and on the expense side your investments in the last three five more years its all in the run rate as you said at investor day and how much benefit do you get from being a scale player because some smaller banks said they can just buy a lot of these things off the shelf and compete with the likes of us bancorp so thats the expense question and then the revenue question is gunjan i know youre leading the goto market strategy kind of what stage of that gotomarket strategy in are we seeing the results now or do we expect to see more of that in the results ahead thanks andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp so mike ill start and then gunjan will add on i think to answer your question id think about it on both components i think its going to be both increased revenue growth and managed expenses so as we talked about we were flattish this time we might have some modest increase as we go into next year but were not going to have expenses growing above revenue levels and i would expect growing revenue and those jaws widening from the expenserevenue differential the revenue will be driven by the activities that gunjan is focused on and ill let her comment gunjan kedia a president us bancorp good morning mike the gotomarket is in its third and final year of our transformation so were beginning to see the results in some of the areas like the consumer deposit we built out a lot of capabilities to manage deposit pricing we benefited from that in this downgrade cycle were seeing a lot of momentum with our multiserve clients and deepening our relationships on the institutional side we saw that with the capital markets growth over this quarter so the impact of a good scaled business model is delivering good positive operating leverage including expense management so this is what we would continue to focus on from an organic growth standpoint mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi andy hi john john on the deposits or on the deposit pricing can you share with us the loan to deposit ratios for the industry and yourselves are not as high as in previous cycles do you think that can give you added flexibility in lowering the costs aside from obviously you talked about the institutional deposits that are essentially i think indexpriced so they come down quickly but in the other deposit classes do you think youre going to have some leverage to lower those rates because the loan to deposit ratio is not at or something like that john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure gerard so i would say that we dont target necessarily loan to deposit ratios what we look at is holistically just overall serving of our clients making sure we have the right mix of deposits and loans and loan growth is obviously going to be a driver or not of deposits and where theyre at this quarter loans were flat to down just slightly and so we took this opportunity to bring down some deposits that were at a higher cost side and you saw that in the results here and so if that continues we would continue to expect that conversely if loan growth continues to take up were going to be making sure that we have the deposit base to suffice that the other thing we always try to manage around that is our liquidity needs as well as interest rate risk profile as well so its kind of more of a holistic nature as it relates to that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then for andy or gunjan on the organic growth strategy some of your peers the bigger banks in particular have embarked upon a branch buildout across the country even two regional banks have done this as well can you share with us as part of your organic strategy how you guys view new branches into maybe newer territories combined with your ongoing digital reachout that of course you have gunjan kedia a president us bancorp good morning gerard maybe ill start here so first the branches are very critical to our business strategy we see deep client relationships anchored around the branch it really drives brand recognition and we are very steady in investing in our branch network our strategy focus is to create density in the highest growth areas within our current footprint rather than use branches to expand out of our footprint and the reason for that is that we have built some very good strong digital capabilities that allow us to deliver our services nationally and we are combining that with our very strong partnerships with other partners that have brand recognition and client reach in areas where we dont have its a powerful combination its a capitallight way of expanding into other markets us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 second is our national businesses from the institutional side there we are actually growing client centers in areas where we are not to expand our reach so youll see us continue to invest in the branch network both inside digitally enabling them but within our current footprint gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gerard operator your next question comes from vivek juneja from jpmorgan your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions just wanted to understand on payments and delve a little bit into that you talked last quarter about corporate payments will be lapping this quarter because you had tough comps with your truckingrelated fees last year but we didnt really see the benefit of that lap in this quarter so anything there that has caused it to be delayed nor have we seen really merchant payment pickup in terms of yearonyear fee growth so any color on whats going on and why the delay and what gives you confidence that itll actually materialize in the coming quarters john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure so vivek i would start by saying that i think there was still a little aftermath here on the freight side in the third quarter but we expect that to completely lap here in the fourth quarter and then we do see corporate spend being stronger we saw some nice momentum at the end of the third quarter and into the fourth quarter and thats whats really giving us the confidence that that will grow from the level that you saw in this quarters results from a corporate payments perspective gunjan kedia a president us bancorp maybe john ill add good morning vivek just a little point on the longterm expectation for payments where payments is in the mix with the client relationship it creates really sticky enduring relationships we do see good core growth in many of the categories of payments they are partially offset by some unique items freight is one of them which was very disrupted postcovid and just is beginning to normalize and there are some others as well so the longterm confidence question that you asked as we look at the client value and we look at the core dynamics and youll see that continue to improve over time vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 thanks for that i have a followup for john john i just want to your comment earlier in response to a question just piqued my interest you said expenses were up because net interest income was up is there incentive comp tied to growing net interest income or is there something else that would drive expenses up when you get net interest income up thats not really any color on that john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp yeah vivek no theres no linkage what i was getting at is were in the in the fourth quarter we have a very good line of sight on what our expense level so were just being more precise really with it i was comparing that to our net interest income that has gone up higher and is in the higher end of our range i was just making a comparison theres no linkage from a compensation perspective in that sense so were just being more precise is the short answer vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning andy i guess one question maybe first on fees and i appreciate youre not talking about right now but just talk to us in terms of the linkage of the fee momentum accelerating from this midsingle digits into next year and how much of that is dependent on loan growth picking up or how much of that can happen where even if loan growth or loan demand is fairly muted in the first half we see better fee revenue momentum being a differentiator for usb john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure from investor day we talked about midsingle digits being in terms of our range from a financial metric performance and i think what you saw this quarter is a good example of that particularly looking at commercial products which has benefited of course from loan growth being done more in the capital markets space we see that benefit in our businesses but weve also grown and have new products new capabilities in that space mortgages is continuing to see nice growth as that has gone the service charges has well start to lap the atm exiting business as we think about that starting in corporate trust continues to be just a very strong growth rates and that is tied in part to the markets of course and so as that continues to develop we have good momentum there and gunjan just talked about the payments side of the house and so i think all those things put us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 together really gives us a lot of confidence in terms of that midsingledigit growth that we think of on the medium term standpoint gunjan kedia a president us bancorp ebrahim ill just add that we do have a very beautifully diversified fee mix so right now were seeing a lot of growth in capital markets and to some extent thats impacting loan growth but our capital markets businesses are very strong otherwise too wealth is seeing a very good year because the stock markets are very strong our investment services businesses benefit from that and then as the rate environment changes we would expect mortgage to have certain momentum so really as we go into the next year it isnt any one thing but its a diversified mix because they play off of each other depending on different macroeconomic environments ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and i guess one followup john when i look at the basis points nim expansion i think you mentioned million lift from the bond book restructuring thats probably a basis point should we expect the basis point expansion as getting better as we move forward with a couple more rate cuts this year the back book repricing like how should we think about the cadence of the nim from here ex any kind of bond restructuring actions and is it conceivable that we could be at a nim in the back half of next year john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp sure so maybe just to go off of a couple those points from a net interest income standpoint in the fourth quarter we expect to have relative stability and thats just thinking about our earning assets are going to be relatively flat we expect and our asset repricing and liability prepricing are going to be largely offsetting so thats kind of how we think about the stability component in the fourth quarter beyond that all the positive momentum that i talked about in terms of continuing remixing in terms of our assets into higher return parts of the portfolio our ability to reprice on deposits as i mentioned on the institutional side and then ultimately on the retail side and then our deposit rotation as you have observed is slowing down and for all intents and purposes complete and so thats all conducive to growth and continued expansion i cant put a timeframe on when exactly occurs but thats a good level to think about and obviously its embedded within our mediumterm guidance that we provided to you during investor day ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and one last one i guess maybe andy i think you mentioned and you mentioned this on the investor day on the becoming a cat ii bank is that in any which way a constraint as we think about pursuing loan growth like is there any reason to believe usb is disadvantaged on pursuing loan growth next year because you have an eye on the billion asset number just address that if you dont mind andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp no there is no constraint on our loan growth the loan growth activity right now is more a function of demand and consistent with the market overall and the ha data that youre seeing and we have no constraints on loan growth and again as a reminder ebrahim the way it works is youre at that billion for four quarters on average so when we think about thats four quarters of impact so we have no constraints on our assets or our balance sheet us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp and we would expect that our growth will be in line with the industry so i mean so were andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp indiscernible industry which is gdp gdpplus john c stern a chief financial officer senior executive vice president us bancorp yes yes exactly ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it all very clear thank you so much andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i think you guys announced that youre looking for a new payments head and were looking externally and we just wondered if you could update us on if there is any updates on that and then i guess what type of person are you looking for and is it to kind of continue the strategy that you had or potentially reevaluate some areas i think theres the general view that maybe you could do more with payments given what the revenue ph quarter is overall and that youve kind of underpunched a little bit so i dont know if youd agree with that but whats the thought in terms of what youre looking for in the new leadership thank you gunjan kedia a president us bancorp matt good morning its gunjan and we are indeed excited to be out in the market looking for new leadership for payments we have a lot of interest in our franchise its unique its different its very important for us and we do have big aspirations for not just a standalone sort of payments franchise but how much it embeds and integrates with the everyday life of our customers so with that we are looking for someone who is talented from a payments perspective but culturally embraces this concept of an interconnected set of solutions for our client base and thats what we are looking for and just to reiterate what we shared we have a long transition time very grateful that shailesh has given us enough time to plan a very smooth and careful transition us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i guess just from a strategic point of view and this isnt trying to lead you one way or the other but are you set on kind of the longterm strategic path that you have in payments or are you open to potentially fairly decent size changes one way or the other again not really leading question but it seems like it might be an opportunity to take a fresh look and look for some opportunities that maybe you havent before gunjan kedia a president us bancorp thank you matt we have deep conviction around the strategy and the path that we are on today when you meet clients and you see the impact of the payments products sets on the relationships we have you sort of build that conviction so the question that we are focused on is how do you execute perhaps differently how do you accelerate the execution how do you stay current with the digital capabilities and all of the strategies that we shared with you on investor day are really focused on accelerating the how rather than sort of rethinking our strategy where we do have a lot of conviction that payments becomes the center point of how people manage their daytoday life and it needs to be embedded in every product every relationship that we have matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt operator operator instructions your next question comes from mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc just a followup from my earlier question related to the benefits of scale and specifically ai as you look to be an ai leader or close follower or do you think you can get those tools off the shelf and just kind of wait and see and the context of the benefits of scale again after your years of investing andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 yeah mike so as you know we do have scale we invest billion a year in technology and technology initiatives we did a great job with the digital capabilities we highlighted those at investor day and were following that same model with the ai initiatives which is the center of excellence and then the business line surrounding them in terms of use cases as we talked about we have a number of use cases underway i would say traditional ai weve been doing for a while generative ai is in the early innings and what is important is we have a structure expertise leadership and technology to deliver on it but it is early innings mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just one cleanup from investor day as it relates to digital strategy i mean going through state farm just one more time and spending the whole day with management in new york city and more information always better but the idea of going out of market where you dont have so much branches and going through state farm with the digital strategy its just are there other examples of banks or nonbanks that have succeeded with that sort of approach its just weve heard a lot of those stories over the last years and they havent always played out so eventually you have to build more branches than you expected or something so again thats just a little bit of cleanup from investor day so andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah im going to start indiscernible mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah andrew j cecere a chairman chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i think for the strategy to work i think you have to have a couple key components one is the digital capabilities to allow it to work with the other partner the second is a partner who has the need from a banking product standpoint for their customer base and then alignment in terms of how that gets done and i think both with state farm and certainly with edward jones those pieces are in place and weve seen good results on that so opening up core banking products checking accounts savings accounts outside of our market through that partnership we have strong conviction on and we believe will be successful because of those attributes gunjan what would you add gunjan kedia a president us bancorp andy i would add mike that we have been in this partnership business for some time now we have a very strong franchise called elan which is a white label credit card provider to other banks so it does take a unique skill set to make these partnerships work and many of these partnerships are restricted in terms of the number of products youre providing so to your point there might come a time when you think about expanding for example charlotte was a market where we organically expanded and were building out branches there but for core product sets and having put in place both the digital and the operational capabilities to fulfill servicing needs for people outside weve become very good at it so we are expanding it now with edward jones and as andy us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 16oct2024 said good early successes and good momentum as a starting point to get your name and your brand in areas that were not in today mike mayo q analyst wells
