andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks jen and good morning everyone thank you for joining our call following our prepared remarks terry jodi mark and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the second quarter we reported earnings per share of consistent with the industry our performance is being impacted by the current economic environment loan growth reflected the impact of defensive draws by corporations in march and early april strong mortgage loan growth and the impact of the paycheck protection program which supported small businesses impacted by the covid19 situation increased liquidity in the financial system and a flight to quality drove strong deposit growth in the quarter our healthy fee income growth this quarter is a testament to our diversified business model some fee lines including our payments businesses were negatively impacted by slower economic activity however we saw very strong growth in our mortgage and commercial products businesses and while consumer spend activity remains pressured compared with a year ago volume trends in each of our payments businesses have improved as some economies have started to reopen expenses were held relatively flat compared with the first quarter we continue to manage our cost structure prudently and in line with the slower revenue growth environment credit quality metrics in the second quarter reflected increased economic stress offset by the beneficial impact of government stimulus and forbearance and deferral programs during the quarter we increased our allowance for loan losses in response to economic conditions we believe our reserve level at june is appropriate based on the information we have available changes in the allowance will be dependent on actual credit performance and changes in economic conditions in the lower right quadrant of this slide you can see that book value per share grew compared with a year ago and we remain well capitalized slide provides key performance metrics we delivered a return on tangible common equity in the second quarter impacted by lower earnings owing to the current economic environment slide shows our continually improving digital uptake trends shelterinplace orders early in the quarter and temporary branch closures due to the covid19 have increased an increase in digital adoptions digital now accounts for more than threequarters of all service transactions and about of all loan sales we expect digital adoption by customers to stick even after the economy fully reopens now let me turn over to terry wholl provide more color on the quarter terrance r dolan vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with the balance sheet review followed by a discussion of the second quarter earnings trends average loans grew on a linkedquarter basis and increased yearoveryear growth includes billion of loans made under the sbas paycheck protection program during the second quarter the average loan size to these small businesses was approximately excluding the impact of ppp average loans grew on a linkedquarter basis and yearoveryear excluding ppp linkedquarter growth was primarily driven by growth in commercial loans and in mortgage loans in late first quarter business customers drew down their lines to support business activity and future liquidity requirements we started to see paydowns of commercial loans in may and the paydown activity accelerated in june as many customers accessed the capital markets as of last week about twothirds of the defensive draws we saw in the late first quarter and early second quarter have been repaid strong residential mortgage growth reflected the low interest rate environment credit card balances declined in the quarter due to lower spend activity turning to slide average deposits increased on a linkedquarter basis and grew yearoveryear average noninterestbearing deposits increased yearoveryear driven by corporate and commercial banking consumer and business banking and wealth management and investment services turning to slide while the net chargeoff ratio was relatively stable on a linkedquarter basis nonperforming assets increased sequentially reflecting increased economic stress the nonperforming assets to loans plus other real estate owned ratio totaled at june compared with at march we have taken a proactive approach in evaluating credit quality across the entire commercial loan portfolio and considered risk rating changes in the evaluation of our allowance for credit losses our loan loss provision was billion in the second quarter inclusive of million of net chargeoffs and a reserve build of billion the increase in the reserve was related to changes in risk ratings and deterioration in economic conditions driven by the impact of covid19 on the us and global economies and our expectation that credit losses and nonperforming assets will increase from current levels the increase in the allowance for credit loss is considered our best estimate of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment partially offset by the benefits of government stimulus programs as of june while estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative judgments our base case outlook assumes an unemployment rate of to for the second quarter declining to in the fourth quarter of and to by the fourth quarter of slide highlights our key underwriting metrics and exposures to certain atrisk segments given the current environment we have a strong relationshipbased credit culture at us bank supported by cash flowbased lending that considers sensitivity to stress proactive management and portfolio diversification which allows us to support growth throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results slide provides an earnings summary in the second quarter of we reported per share these results were adversely affected by the current economic environment and the related impact to consumer and business spend and the expected increases in credit losses us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion was essentially flat compared with the first quarter in line with our expectations as the impact of lower interest rates was partially offset by deposit and funding mix and loan growth also as expected the net interest margin declined by basis points compared with the first quarter the lower margin reflected lower rates and a flatter yield curve as well as higher cash balance being maintained for liquidity to accommodate customer demand while loan mix put pressure on the net interest margin the earning asset impact was mostly offset by beneficial shifts in deposit and funding mix slide highlights trends in noninterest income strength in mortgage banking and commercial product revenue more than offset declines in the payment revenues mortgage banking revenue benefited from higher mortgage production and stronger gain on sale margins partially offset by the net impact of change in fair value of mortgage servicing rights and related hedging activity commercial product revenue reflected higher corporate bond issuance fees and trading revenue slide provides information about our payment services businesses including exposures to impacted industries payments revenues was pressured by the impact of covidrelated shutdowns and reduced economic activity in the quarter however consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter and that trajectory has continued in early july credit and debit card revenue declined yearoveryear and merchant processing services revenue declined yearoveryear both categories performing somewhat better than what we had expected corporate payment products revenue declined yearoveryear in line with our expectations as business spending continues to reflect cautious sentiment turning to slide noninterest expense was essentially flat on a linkedquarter basis in line with our expectations second quarter expense reflected an increase in revenue related costs from mortgage and capital markets production and expense related to covid19 situation during the quarter we incurred incremental covid19 related costs of approximately million these expenses consisted of about million related to increasing liabilities for potential future delivery claims related to the airline industry and other merchants and about million related to premium pay for frontline workers and costs tied to providing a safe working environment for our employees we expect these incremental covid expenses to begin to dissipate in the second half of the year slide highlights our capital position at june our common equity tier capital ratio calculated in accordance with transitional regulatory capital requirements related to the current expected credit loss methodology implementation was at june our common equity tier capital ratio reflecting the full implementation of the current expected credit loss accounting methodology was ill now provide some forwardlooking guidance for the third quarter of we expect fully taxable equivalent net interest income to be relatively flat compared to the second quarter we expect mortgage revenue to continue to be strong on a yearoveryear basis in the third quarter but it is likely to decline compared with the second quarter reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry payments revenue is likely to be adversely affected through the remainder of the year on a yearoveryear basis due to reduced consumer and business spending activity however we expect continued gradual improvement in sales volumes we expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared with the second quarter us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 future levels of reserve build will depend on a number of factors including changes in the outlook for credit quality reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance and any beneficial offset from government stimulus we will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses as credit conditions change for the full year we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry ill end my remarks on slide which highlights a few of the recent actions weve taken as a company to help support our customers communities and employees we are operating in uncertain times not only for the economy but for society in general however i am confident that together we can make lasting and impactful changes that will leave us all better on the other side of these trying times we are wellpositioned for nearterm challenges and we continue to manage this company with a longterm lens and focus on maximizing shareholder value our capital and liquidity positions are strong and our unique business model remains a differentiator for us i would highlight three things that we will continue to support our ability to deliver industryleading returns through the cycle first as our second quarter results indicate our diversified business mix reduces revenue and earnings volatility and this quarter it allowed us to deliver good revenue growth even against a challenging interest rate backdrop and an industrywide slowdown in consumer spending activity second our timetested credit underwriting discipline puts us in a strong position to navigate through an economic downturn while setting us up to return to prudent and consistent growth in the more favorable economic environment and third our culture remains the foundation which informs not only what we do at us bank but how we do it i couldnt be more proud of our employees whove come together to support our customers and communities and they face significant economic and social disruption i want to take this opportunity to thank them for all their hard work and resiliency we will now open up the call for qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys hey thank you for taking the question lets see i guess terry a question for you just on you gave the nii expectation for the third quarter i wonder if you could talk a little bit about the sort of the puts and takes meaning balance sheet growth and where youd see the margin trajecting from here terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yes from a loan perspective again we would expect that well see yearoveryear growth but on a linked quarter basis clearly its going to be down were going to continue to see paydowns associated with those defensive draws that we had at the end of the first quarter and early second quarter so that will put downward pressure on a linkedquarter basis ppp will actually probably help from a growth standpoint as we think about second quarter but it does start to dissipate in third and fourth quarter simply because its a loan forgiveness program so on the consumer side auto lending has generally been a little bit it was weak in april and may but its gotten stronger in june so we believe that thats going to be a bright spot as we think about the third quarter but overall consumer lending is likely to be down simply because consumer spending has been down so thats kind of the puts and takes if you think about loan growth margin we believe is going to be relatively stable it will be helped a little bit by ppp but impacted a little bit therell be a little bit of pressure on the yield curve side of the equation but relatively stable to the second quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then just given the absolute level of interest rates do fee waivers start to become an issue in the money market area and if i recall correctly from the last time rates were this low i think those show up in trust fees if theyre sort of something you guys are thinking about where would they show up and whats kind of the impact you guys would see terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i think the impact would be probably similar to what we saw last time given but maybe a little bit more simply because of the growth but well show it in trust and investment management fees because thats where our money market fund revenue gets recognized us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you guys very much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc just to clarify on the net interest income outlook of stable quartertoquarter does that include some of the kind of benefit from ppp repaying or forbearing and if so what are your assumptions on that in terms of the next couple of quarters terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so it includes all of the puts and takes like i said it will reflect a decline on a linkedquarter basis in terms of commercial loans because of the draws but there will be some benefit associated with ppp so it includes essentially all the puts and takes associated with net interest income matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then i am wondering on the ppp it seems like your kind of approach was more granular or to go after kind of smaller really the smallsmall businesses if i just look at your total amount funded versus applications and just wondering if you could talk to that approach and maybe give us some insight in terms of the cost that youve incurred to originate those loans andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 matt this is andy we took the applications as they came in serving our customers initially and then ultimately outside of the bank as you saw we had over applications and the average balance was in the so a lot of our customers are small business and we helped a lot of employees so the team did a great job we started with a bit of a manual process and went to a much more automated process certainly in the second round so it was just based on the request that came in and the priority was really time based matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just the cost to originate was it just kind of moving resources from one part of the bank to another andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah yes it was matt we actually had individuals throughout the entire company help us through this process particularly the manual process that started and the technology as well but yes the entire bank was supportive matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning i wanted to drill down a little bit on your comments terry on the payments business and sort of a gradual improvement there i guess first of all could you just give us a little bit of a sense for how much the consumer recovered and then seemed like in june the yearonyear declines in acquiring volumes and the current volumes has really really lessened but can you just give us a sense of what say the exit rates were in terms of volumes in those categories in june versus march and i guess as an adjunct to that why wouldnt that suggest that at least sequentially you should see pretty sharp improvements in terms of the sequential growth in issuing and acquiring revenue versus release versus the us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 second quarter obviously yearonyears tough but versus the second quarter which seem to suggest that you could see a nice improvement sequentially and i just wanted to get your sense as to whether im thinking about that right terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah saul i think youre right on i think when we end up looking at our payments business on a sequential basis we will see growth particularly in the credit card and the merchant the corporate payments we would also expect growth but maybe not at the same level simply because sales volumes there our commercial spend or commercial customers are still fairly cautious but to kind of give you some perspective at the end of or in april we saw on the merchant side of the equation consumer spend was down almost between kind of in that ballpark and today its really back to spend levels are closer to about so that has come back really very nicely the things that are going to continue to impact for a while is the mix associated with the airline industry and some of the entertainment but it has come back very nicely so your point on sequential growth is right on with respect to credit card credit card we had said was down kind of in that range in april and that has come back nicely as well in terms of credit card it is still down its down around to we would expect that trajectory to continue saul into third quarter debit card revenue or sales excuse me actually have been pretty strong and the sales on the debit card side has been kind of up to kind of in that range and while we wouldnt expect it to be maybe quite at that higher level in the third quarter it is still i think going to be relatively strong and then on the cps side of the equation cps again the commercial spend has been pretty cautious it was down kind of in the magnitude of to in that april sort of timeframe and its still down around somewhere between and we do expect it to get a little better than that in the third quarter for a couple of reasons simply because government spend tends to be strongest in the third quarter so hopefully that gives you some insights or perspective saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yes no thats super helpful if i could squeeze another one in on fees the deposit service charge is obviously down a lot and you commented about fee waivers related with covid i mean how do we think about that going forward and i dont know if you can quantify that or just give us a sense of how that i think million how that could compare to maybe a more normalized level in the coming quarters terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah similar sort of impacts as consumer spend and just activity has declined and then you have the stimulus checks and all sorts of ph erudite things just incidence levels related to nsf and fee waivers in terms of helping our customers has impacted the second quarter on a sequential basis we would expect that will come back nicely in the third quarter but on a yearoveryear basis its still going to be down simply because consumer activity is down similar to merchant or credit card us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so it will take some time to get back to sort of a more normalized or was a more normalized level i guess terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yes thats right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc all right awesome thank you very much terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah thank you operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp morning erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc my first question is on the reserve and this is a question that all your peers have been getting during this earnings season so i always like to think in the cecl world that your reserve to loan ratio of represents a cumulative loss rate for the recession that represents lets say two years and i guess the question here is that is that your view i guess its another way of asking are you done in terms of reserve building and related to that your peers have also talked about the base case but that the base case tends to be one of lets say five or so different scenarios and those scenarios are weighted and so im wondering if you could give us some insight in terms of as you had built your reserve how much weight that base case was taken into account versus perhaps other scenarios terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so let me take the first question and when we think about the reserving youre absolutely right you make your estimates at the end of any particular quarter based upon the information that you have available at that particular point in time and certainly at june we believe that the reserve is appropriate for the cumulative losses that are there us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 so we wouldnt expect future increases in the reserve but again that is going to be highly dependent upon what changes either in terms of economic factors or if our credit quality changes differently than what we had expected so the important thing is that were going to continue to assess the reserve every quarter based upon the information that we have available to us but you are right theoretically that is how cecl works and thats how were trying to apply it coming to your second question the information that i ended up giving to you with respect to unemployment now keep in mind unemployment is an important factor but theres like different multiples that are a part of the modeling process so its pretty complex because youve got a lot of different types of portfolios et cetera but unemployment the information i gave you was really the weighted average across many different multiple scenarios that we ended up looking at so you are right when we look at this we look at information from many sources in terms of things like unemployment gdp et cetera et cetera we develop a base case if you will but then we look at multiple scenarios around that base case and weight it but the information that i gave you was weighted based upon those multiples so it should give you some comparability when you think about that andy have you anything to add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp no youve said it well erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and my followup question is to andy sorry andy i think what was particularly impressive about this quarter is your ppnr resiliency and obviously the forward look would imply that this will continue and terry just told us that we could be done in terms of reserve building as we think about the future and as we think about a more difficult operating environment for banks how are you thinking about inorganic growth strategies from here andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp well erica first as you mentioned i think our diversified revenue mix helps a lot and this quarter probably represented it very well we had some pressure on payments because of the spend activity that terry talked about but mortgage and commercial products had a it hit it out of the park this quarter in terms of positives and then the other part of our diversification is how much of our revenue comes from the balance sheet or net interest income as well as fee revenue sort of a mix stack there so that really helps in environments like this and different businesses do well in different economic cycles as we think about the future i think we are planning for a future that has continued low rates it will take a while for spend to get back to normal so were going to manage our expenses with that thought in mind which is what were doing today and were going to continue to invest in the businesses that have opportunity as well as the digital initiatives that i talked about and those digital initiatives will offer not only the opportunity for our customers to connect with us in a virtual means i think it will also offer expense opportunities in the long run so those are the ways were thinking about it erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc and just any thoughts on inorganic strategies acquisitions i guess to say it more bluntly us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah thanks for being blunt so we will look at opportunities that come up the only thing id say is in this environment erika theres a lot of uncertainty and its certainly not a clear vision in terms of the future even for us so to look at someone else with that lens will be challenging but i do think opportunities will come up because of the stresses that are out there and well take a look erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator our next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i want to challenge your look youre one of the most conservative banks but i want to challenge some of your conservatism so on your base case again unemployment by the end of this year i know its a lot of scenarios and its weighted average and all that but at least one of your peers was more conservative than that and i know thats the fed base case so theres nothing crazy about it its just i thought why not be more conservative if you have the flexibility or when you take the weighted average of the different scenarios im pushing back a little bit where like this seems like peak reserve builds and you said that but if your economic assumptions are wrong then that wont be the case so why not be more conservative there and along those lines your payments comment that it should improve sequentially kind of makes sense but look we just had a big increase in covid cases which leads to more deaths which leads to some closing down and how are you feeling about that progression terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so maybe to address the first question when you end up establishing the reserve you have to establish what you believe is appropriate based upon the information which we have available to us and we use things like moodys analytics and other sources in order to kind of come up with that projection of what unemployment as an example looks like so you have to make sure that your reserve is appropriate based upon the information that you have you cant build in tons of conservatism so to speak into it but again part of it is well have to kind of wait and see us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 on the payments side of the equation in terms of covid cases based upon our estimates right now i think that this go around versus last go around i think that states are continuing to try to stay open to the best that they can i think you have different health treatments and all sorts of different things that exist based upon better information or different information than what existed before but quite honestly were going to find out theres a lot of uncertainty and its too early to know andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah and id add on mike i think youre right things are changing every day and the facts change daily weekly sometimes hourly so were just going to continue to assess and manage the company given the changes that are out there what terry is telling you what he is seeing right now and as he said we get data every day and were going to continue to assess what we think is going to happen were running a lot of models were sharing with our board a lot of scenarios including a much harsher scenario and understanding what would occur in that but youre right i mean theres a lot of unknown yet and we are being conservative in the way were approaching our financial modeling mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one followup question look your third slide of substance its slide number but the digital engagement trends i mean youre certainly putting that front and center can you bring us up to date like as of like to the moment of whats happening with your digital engagement and what does that mean in terms of branches and national expansion and anything else because if youre putting this as your third slide in your earnings deck its clearly i know its always been important but it seems like now its being put on steroids in terms of the way youre highlighting this which must mean some bigger part of the strategy andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so mike it has always been important but i do think the recent events and the customer behavior changes has even accelerated that further and you can see that in the numbers of nearly of transactions now occurring in a digital fashion the branch activity as far as transactions is down a lot on the sales side i talk about the loan sales but actually total sales in the branches have doubled since a year excuse me on the digital platform have doubled versus a year ago and so we do expect those digital investments both doityourself and doittogether in other words cobrowsing or virtual activity is going to continue to be important not just for the consumer but across many business lines so that investment that were making is important on two fronts its important to make sure were giving the customer the best experience in connecting with them in the ways they choose to and its also offering efficiencies in the long run as we talked about we announced over a year ago that we expect to have to fewer branches and i would expect that number to increase in terms of the number of fewer branches that we have because of this change in customer behavior branches will still be important but the number of them and the size of them will be fewer and less us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc any number on those branches the updated number andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp we dont have a number on it yet we continue to assess and as we think about the changes that are occurring and the closures that are out there well continue to assess what we expect but i do expect it to be higher than the to mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone going back to the paycheck protection program we talked a little bit about the expectations for forgiveness there but do you have a timeline on where you think your 7plus billion in ppp loans may start to be forgiven terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah well we do expect that theres going to be some forgiveness thats going to take place as early as the third quarter so theres going to be some runoff of the balances just because of that i think the vast majority of it happens late third fourth and early first quarter in terms of timing thats our expectation right now david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay and then on the deposit side obviously very good deposit growth there how do you see the trajectory of that playing out taking into consideration the ppp and all liquidity thats built in now and how does it impact the size of the balance sheet through the rest of the year terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 yeah well our expectation is that the deposit growth is going to continue to be strong at least through the end of the year if not into early next year and its really highly correlated to the amount of liquidity that the fed is continuing to pump into the system the impacts from a balance sheet perspective as you know i think certainly you have a funding benefit associated with that the challenge is always trying to identify if you get the loan growth great if you dont youre going to have to look for opportunities on the investment side of the equation but we do expect strong growth in deposits into the foreseeable future because of the fed programs david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks david operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi hey guys hey good morning just one question on the expense side obviously much strongerthan expected revenues especially out of mortgage but noting that youre talking about some of the covid costs coming off and that even some of the like i would think incentive related cost type of stuff like mortgage will be softer sequentially youre still talking about flattish expenses sequentially i was wondering if maybe you can kind of put that in context with some of the broader reaching comments you just made about the future of the expense base in terms of why youd only expect to see flat expenses sequentially thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah the areas that were going to see growth or not i mean on a sequential basis i do think youre going to see revenue related sort of expenses coming down a bit we will see covidrelated expenses coming down theres still going to be a fairly significant amount of ppp and costs associated with all sorts of things that will end up happening in the third quarter the other thing that i think that ends up coming into play is just timing with respect to for example other loan expenses and when they end up getting recognized relative to the mortgage production that occurred so we recognize revenue in the quarter in which the application is taken and locked but a lot of the expenses end up happening in the quarter thats following that simply because of the timing of closing loans and that sort of thing so thats a big driver that ends up impacting the sequential growth from second to third quarter that you have to keep in mind ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 okay and a followup on the money market fee waivers you had mentioned earlier that you would expect them to be larger than last time can you put that into a numeric context for us how much were you waiving either on an annual basis or at peak through the last cycle and how is the asset management complex differ in terms of mix today versus then thanks terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yes in terms of the mix of the product that we end up offering i think theres probably a more government or govie based sort of money market as opposed to prime based the prime base declined fairly significantly but the overall when you end up looking at assets under management its certainly were at a higher level today than years ago thats the reason i think that the rate of the fee waivers will be pretty similar but just the assets under management in the wealth management space is higher and im trying to put my fingers on kind of what that looks like right now but we certainly can kind of get back to you ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks a lot ill follow up andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp terry i think fee waivers will when theyre implemented will be somewhere in that million a quarter range plus or minus terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah operator your next question comes from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks thank you for taking the questions a couple of ones firstly on credit cards can you give us the reserves to cards and also what are you seeing in terms of card customers where deferrals are coming off have you started to see deferrals come off and whats the reaction been in terms of customers paying the full amount or asking to extend the deferrals andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks vivek im going to ask mark runkel our chief credit officer to respond to that mark us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah the reserve ratio on the credit card was at the end of june thats question number one the second in terms of those customers that have come off some of the programs that weve gotten in place weve seen very strong payment performance to date about of those customers have started to make normal payments after those periods of time weve seen a few of those about reenrolled and then the rest has moved into delinquency so so far so good on customer performance vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats great terry if i may just sneak in one for you other income i know it had a lot of noise this quarter what would you suggest as a run rate for us to use terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so if you kind of think about the when i end up looking at the current run rate just given the environment that were in vivek i would end up looking at second quarter is a pretty good estimate of what future quarters are going to look like at least for a while vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc meaning at this million that you had roughly terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay yeah okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi andy how are you hi terry andy weve seen some real cross currents in economic information for example the empire state manufacturing index came out today positive first time since february and industrial production coming in a little better today as well but on the other hand the initial unemployment claims numbers remain very elevated us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 what are your customers when you talk to your customers and i understand the restaurants and the leisure guys are still feeling a lot of pain but can you give us some color on what are your commercial customers telling you what are they seeing andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah so first youre absolutely right there are some mixed signals and i think the mixed signals is the sort of the competing factors of the stress in the economy from the shutdown offset by the stimulus thats occurring across many categories unemployment benefits the stimulus checks ppp all those things and those are competing forces which makes modeling and projecting very difficult in this environment i would say small businesses are struggling the most for a lot of different reasons principally because they have less cushion than the larger companies the larger companies as terry mentioned initially they were very defensive drawing down in excess of billion but about twothirds of that is paid back so while certain industries continue to be stressed youre seeing other industries that are actually doing a little bit better in this environment so small challenged middle and large mixed some doing well and some not so much terry what would you add or mark terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp no mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp no i think thats well said i mean i think its right and spot on gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then as a followup in the reserving and the provisioning you guys did this quarter i know you mentioned theres a lot of moving parts as you just touched on it andy but how much would you say of the provisioning was allocated to specific credits that youre now starting to see obviously distressed versus just building up the general reserves terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i mean ill have mark kind of add to this but certainly when we end up looking at net chargeoffs and things like that there hasnt been a lot of movement especially on the consumer side of the equation we are starting to see nonperforming assets on commercial starting to grow as we talked about but its still what i would say relatively early i think the government stimulus programs and things like that have kind of at least for some period of time muted some of those underlying credit characteristics that you typically see so more of it or most of it is really driven based upon kind of our outlook when we think about the economic conditions going forward us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 and then at the end i was looking at kind of the split between products its probably more heavily weighted plus percent of the reserve build really more focused on wholesale and commercial real estate as opposed to consumer at this particular point in mark what would get mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp the only other thing i might add is you mentioned this in the early comments weve gone through the portfolio very granular and downgraded the credits appropriately should we feel like all of thats been factored into the analysis on the allowance gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp but the bulk of the change is really the economic assumptions that terry noted terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp thanks gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i appreciate that thank you terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp hey ken coming back to your question on fee waivers ken coming back to your question on fee waivers the impact second to third quarter so on a sequential basis the fee waivers will be about million in that ballpark operator and your final question comes from the line of ph david smith with autonomous q good morning thank you for taking the call andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks q just to clarify on the expense guidance stable to relatively does that include the covid expenses in us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 15jul2020 terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp yeah that its total expenses its all inclusive and again well see benefit of covid coming down but some of those production type costs that i talked about earlier going up q thank you and also any particular color you could give on the jump in nonperforming loans in commercial real estate terrance r dolan a vice chairman chief financial officer us bancorp mark mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah i would just say theyre really focused in on a couple of different industries that weve highlighted one on the commercial side is really heavily energy and the retail sector and then on the commercial real estate is going to be some of the retailrelated exposure as well its coming off a very low point as we note but those are the industries that have been most impacted todate q thank you so much operator at this time i would like to turn the call back over to management for any closing remarks jennifer ann thompson directorinvestor
