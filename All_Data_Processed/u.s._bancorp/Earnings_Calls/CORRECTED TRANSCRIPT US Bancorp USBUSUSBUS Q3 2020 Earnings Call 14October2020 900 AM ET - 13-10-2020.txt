earnings call 14oct2020 ill now turn the call over to andy andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks jen good morning everyone and thank you for joining our call following our prepared remarks terry jodi mark and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the third quarter we reported earnings per share of our revenue of billion was higher on both a linked quarter and yearoveryear basis driven by strong fee income performance across a number of business lines credit quality metrics deteriorated inline with our expectations primarily reflecting more challenging operating conditions for some commercial sectors impacted by covid19 however our reserve build in the third quarter was limited to the addition related to our acquisition of billion of credit card loans from state farm our capital and liquidity positions remained strong and our deposit mix improved as a third quarter as demand deposits increased sharply while higher cost time deposits declined the bottom right quadrant of this slide shows our strong capital position at september our common equity tier capital ratio was slide provides key performance metrics in the third quarter we delivered a return on tangible common equity slide shows steady improvement in digital activities notably digital sales now account for more than half of all loan sales highlighting how our business investments are supporting our customers evolving behavior digital remains a focused investment area for us and as more activity moves to the digital channel it will drive customer loyalty and top line growth as well as cost savings and efficiency opportunities now let me turn the call over to terry who will provide more color on the quarter terrance r dolan vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of third quarter earnings trends average loans declined compared with the second quarter in early july we added billion in credit card loans required as part of our new alliance with state farm additionally loans made under the sba paycheck protection program increased by billion on average in the quarter excluding the state farm and ppp loans average loans declined by as strong residential mortgage growth was more than offset by the impact of paydowns in the ci portfolio given strong capital markets activities during the third quarter turning to slide average deposits increased compared with the second quarter and the overall deposit mix continues to be favorable our noninterest bearing deposits grew while time deposits declined in early october we closed on the acquisition of billion of deposits from state farm which will add to deposit balances and increase liquidity in the fourth quarter turning to slide as expected under the current economic environment credit quality deteriorated in the third quarter our net chargeoff ratio was in the third quarter up basis points compared with the second us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 quarter as higher losses in our commercial and commercial real estate portfolios were partially offset by lower credit card and total other retail net chargeoffs the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at the end of the third quarter compared with at the end of the second quarter our loan loss provision was million in the third quarter the provision amount included million related to the credit card loans acquired from state farm at the beginning of the quarter our allowance for credit losses as of september totaled billion or of loans the allowance level reflected our best estimate of the impact of slower economic growth and elevated unemployment partially offset by the consideration of benefits of government stimulus programs while estimates are based on many quantitative factors and qualitative judgments our base case outlook assumes an unemployment rate of for the third quarter increasing slightly to in the fourth quarter of before declining somewhat to by the fourth quarter of slide highlights our key underwriting metrics and loan loss allowance breakdown by loan category we have a strong relationshipbased credit culture at us bank supported by cash flow based lending that considers sensitivity to stress proactive management and portfolio diversification which allows us to support growth throughout the economic cycle and produces consistent results turning to slide exposures to certain atrisk segments given the current environment are stable compared with the second quarter the top left table shows that the volume of payment relief has declined meaningfully since the second quarter new requests have reached a steadystate since peaking in april slide provides an earnings summary in the third quarter of we earned per diluted share turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis of billion was up compared with the second quarter as a basis point increase in our net interest margin offset the impact of a decrease in loan volume the increase in the net interest margin was driven by lower cash balances we expect cash balances to increase in the fourth quarter primarily due to the recent acquisition of the deposits from state farm slide highlights trends in noninterest income strength in mortgage banking and commercial product revenue drove the yearoveryear increase while linked quarter growth reflected higher payments revenue and deposit service charges as consumer spend activity continued to recover from second quarter ph lows slide provides information about our payment services business lines including exposures to the impacted industries yearoveryear payments revenue was pressured by reduced consumer spend compared with pre covid levels however consumer sales trends improved throughout the quarter as state and local economies continued to improve and spend activity increased in the third quarter credit and debit card revenue benefited from the processing of state unemployment distribution programs that utilize our prepaid cards we expect this activity to moderate in the fourth quarter over the long term payments revenues are closely tied to spend activity and the resultant sales volume trends turning to slide noninterest expenses increased on a yearoveryear basis driven by higher costs related to the pre prepaid card business covid19related expenses and higher revenuerelated costs from mortgage and capital markets production on a linked quarter basis noninterest expenses increased us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 relative to our expectations we saw an increase in medical claims expenses as employees regained access to medical services following the stayathome orders and higher revenuerelated costs tied to the mortgage and capital markets activities and most notably higher prepaid card processing activities slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at september was ill now provide some forwardlooking guidance for the fourth quarter of we expect fully taxableequivalent net interest income to be flat to down slightly we expect mortgage revenue to decline somewhat compared to the third quarter reflecting slower refinancing activity for the industry and seasonality payments revenue is likely to continue to be adversely affected on a yearoveryear basis due to reduced consumer and business spend activity we expect noninterest expenses to be relatively stable compared to the third quarter we expect net chargeoffs and nonperforming assets to continue to increase from current levels reflective of economic conditions future levels of reserves will depend on a number of factors including loan production size and mix changes in the outlook for credit quality reflecting both economic conditions and portfolio performance and any beneficial offset from government stimulus we will continue to assess the adequacy of the allowance for losses as credit conditions change for the full year of we expect our taxableequivalent tax rate to be approximately i will hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry the economy is showing signs of recovery but consumer spending remains below precovid levels the unemployment rate is high by historical standards and the outlook remains uncertain however we are wellpositioned to navigate through a more challenging economic and interest rate environment were well reserved wellcapitalized and our liquidity position is strong we remain committed to creating longterm value for our shareholders by delivering aboveaverage returns on equity through the cycle driven by both superior ppnr results and credit performance our third quarter earning results highlights the benefits of our diversified business mix and our credit underwriting discipline we are optimistic that we can continue to win market share over time across our highreturn fee businesses such as mortgage payments and trust and investment services we will continue to adjust our strategy as consumer preferences evolve including adjusting our distribution network our alliance with state farm which brings our digital banking capabilities together with over sic state farm agents is an example how we can meaningfully expand our reach in a lowcost highly efficient way separately about months ago we announced the branch transformation initiative aimed at better serving our customers in light of their evolving preferences at that time we announced that we would close to of our branches by early to date we have closed about we now plan to close an additional by early the majority of these additional closures were branches that were impacted by covid19 and they will remain closed us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 while physical branches and personal interactions will always be important we need fewer branches today than we did even a few years ago and the branches of the future need to be more advice centers than locations where transactions take place ill conclude on slide our culture has always been a key differentiator of the us bank story and we remain committed to supporting our customers our communities and our employees in the good times as well as the more challenging times while it has always been important to us today there is even a greater emphasis on ensuring that we do that in a deliberately inclusive way i want to thank our employees who bring our culture to life every day and for all their hard work throughout the year well now open up the call to qa question and answer section operator your first question is from john pancari with evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp good morning john andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi just on that comment regarding the branches can you help us think about the cost impact of the stepup in the consolidation of the branches is that factored into your expectations of expenses and i guess if you can kind of just elaborate on how you see expenses trajecting and if this could impact your efficiency expectations thanks terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah john great question and when we think about expenses our goal is especially in this environment to be able to manage expenses relatively flat and it is one of the things that we have kind of considered or factored into that process the cost saves associated with the branches will be important us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 part of that we do expect will flow to the bottom line and part of it well continue to use to reinvest in our business particularly in the digital capabilities and kind of as you can imagine the more were investing in that the greater the opportunity with respect to future cost savings will come as well so thats kind of how were thinking about it john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay and then just one more thing on that front are you also do you also see opportunities to ratchet up corporate real estate rationalization outside of the branches and could that be incremental savings on top of this terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so well look not only at the branches well also look at our corporate real estate one of the things that were still kind of working through is what does the next horizon from a workforce management perspective look like because that will obviously impact corporate real estate but i do think that theres opportunity for us to be able to consolidate as we think about john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks terry and then just one more thing on the revenue side i know that your fees definitely came in better this quarter helped by the card and processing fees and i just want to get your thought on your payments revenues given just where you see consumer and corporate payments trajecting over the next several months i know you commented on the prepaid card expectation but i wanted to get your thoughts more broadly on the payments trajectory here terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so one thing i would say is that since the second quarter weve continued to see improvement in consumer and business spend which is good across all of those different areas and if you end up looking at the one slide youll see that excluding the airline travel entertainment the sales consumer spend has actually come back very nicely and so i think that on a goforward basis the impacts will be really some of those atrisk industries for some period of time ultimately the trajectory of growth in the payments business will be tied to that consumer and business spend overall there will be a little bit of lumpiness in the third quarter for example with respect to the prepaid card which is really driven by the stimulus programs if we see a stimulus program in the fourth or first quarter that might give us a little bit of lift but its not something that were contemplating at this particular point in time andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and i would just add this is andy john that as terry mentioned we see continued improvement across all three categories merchant acquiring credit card issuing as well as the corporate payment system the trough for all those occurred in april and each and every month since then theres been slight improvement in spend across all those categories us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thanks andy thanks terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah operator your next question is from bill carcache with wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning andy and terry it sounds like you guys have the unemployment rate rising from here is that just conservatism or is there something else that you guys are seeing if you could just give a little bit of color on the top line terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i dont think its anything specific that were seeing i do think bill that maybe our expectation if you think about corporate america youre starting to see some reductions in force whether its in the airline industry and some of the entertainment industries i think that because of the stimulus programs that have existed some of those companies have deferred taking some of those actions our expectation as we think about the fourth quarter is some of those actions are going to impact the unemployment levels before they start to come back down bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and i guess a separate question is how would you characterize your gearing to the shortend versus the longend of the curve and if theres any sensitivity that you could give that would be great terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp how we are im sorry us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp interest rate sensitivity in short and long end terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so maybe just stepping back our balance sheet is about floating fixed well continue to see a little bit of churn on the fixed side for some period of time were always looking for opportunities to be able to reinvest in the investment portfolio with a little bit more duration and will kind of continue to manage that our assetliability position widens so were assetsensitive and that widened in the first quarter quite a bit and since then its been relatively stable and well continue to kind of manage that way for some period of time when we bring on the deposits as an example well hold that generally on the shortend by increasing liquidity levels because i think that future opportunity in terms of rate increases is a better tradeoff than investing it immediately today bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thanks terry and if i could squeeze in one last one some of your competitors have hedging programs in place that have served as a source of support for their net interest margins but you guys havent benefited materially from hedges and i guess as hedges begin to roll off that should benefit you guys relative to others because you wont have to deal with those future headwinds is that by design or i guess just wondering if theres any color that you can give around hedging strategy and positioning indiscernible terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah historically we typically just use the balance sheet as a way of kind of hedging or setting up our assetliability position so we utilize for example duration and composition of our investment portfolio in order to do that so we dont do a lot of active hedging i will tell you though we did do some hedging middle of last year and when rates came down nicely we were able to lock in the gains associated with it which i think will help a bit but its not a major part of our program bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you for taking my questions terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp thanks bill andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp hey gerard good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning andy good morning terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning andy can you guys give us some additional color i noticed and you pointed out in the call that you took some chargeoffs in commercial real estate in the covidrelated sectors can you give us some color of what youre seeing in terms of the writedowns that are required to move through this period of time with these types of sectors mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp hey good morning gerard this is mark runkel ill answer that question first off i would just start off by saying our credit quality is performing in line with our expectations at this point and as you know we have a couple guiding principles in how we think about managing credit first being is that we stay very consistent in our underwriting throughout the cycle number two is were very proactive at identifying and working through problem credits when they arise and so what i would say is the result of that is as and youll have seen this as our criticized commitments did increase early in the downturn in this particular cycle and so as we think of our chargeoffs the level of charge offs at least this quarter did increase as a result of that so its really a timing issue and in the end we think were going to continue to have very superior credit quality performance throughout the economic cycle terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp and i know mark weve been very actively managing that portfolio of the atrisk industries in order to bring that exposure down mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp thats right terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp thats the driver behind the net chargeoff levels us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp exactly right gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and within these portfolios i dont know if there was any hotel properties that may have had to be written down what are you actually seeing in terms of on a individual credit basis are you seeing or writedown the ones that you do have to writedown mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah i think i mean thats exactly the range that were currently seeing on those properties and its really propertyspecific so it does vary greatly but those that are the most distressed are in that kind of range that you talked about gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i see and then just as a followup some of the bigger universal money center type banks have discussed that the consumer net chargeoffs because of the support from the fiscal programs and other types of programs may be pushed out into the second half of so its not necessarily avoiding them its just the timing of it do you guys have any color on the consumer side what youre seeing in terms of the potential for chargeoffs andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i would echo those comments gerard this is andy the credit stats for the consumer portfolio are really good right now and the indicators the delinquencies all those facts are more positive than you would expect given the economic environment that were in part of that certainly is due to the stimulus plans the unemployment benefits all those things which is creating a bit of a bridge i do expect that at some point in well start to see an acceleration of credit deterioration in the consumer portfolios once those benefits start to wear down gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from erika najarian from bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp good morning erika andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc im wondering big incremental announcement on identifying another of your branches that you will take offline and im wondering if you could help quantify the cost savings that you expect to derive from those closures and the timing of when that starts impacting your run rate positively terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yes when we end up looking at the potential savings associated with those branches its kind of in that million range plus or minus we do expect to see that that impact will really start to hit our run rate even in the first quarter but again just as a reminder some of that will come through in terms of expense opportunity or benefit and some of its going to get reinvested in digital capabilities which will also have an impact in terms of expenses andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp and erika i want to reiterate a point i made in my prepared remarks which is that as you think about the additional the great majority around or so of those branches already have been closed as a result of covid during this period so what they really are is resulting in a permanent closure and again all of this reflects changes in customer behaviors and activities we saw an acceleration of digital transactions and sales you saw the sales numbers on lending activity and that only accelerated during the covid period and thats the result is what were doing and again about of those have already been closed for the last few months erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you and as a followup to that outside perhaps of those potential savings you have been pretty good at calling out covidrelated expenses i guess it was million this quarter million last quarter and as we think about your statement in terms of running expenses flat shall we think about those expenses dropping off in the run rate or are those expenses related to covid going to be reinvested elsewhere in terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp well a little bit of both so when we think about we do expect that some of those covidrelated expenses will continue at least into the early part of the year until the kind of returntowork environment starts to settle in and then savings associated with that again part of it will accrue to the bottom line and part of it will be a part of our reinvestment in our business as we think about going forward us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just one more followup question clearly a strong quarter i think we continue to get pushback from portfolio managers in terms of owning banks due to the interest rate outlook and as we think about your outlook for the fourth quarter of nii flat to down slightly are you confident that without any further changes in the rate outlook that well see the bottom in net interest income in the fourth quarter and anything from here whether its higher inflation better growth or the yield curve resteepening would be an opportunity terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah i think its a little hard to call exactly when net interest income kind of hits the trough i mean part of it i mean theres so many different puts and takes in terms of loan demand and where interest rates kind of go from here what the impact of premium amortization is theres just a lot of puts and takes so i think its a little bit early for us to say for example its in erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks erika operator your next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi andy hi terry terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp good morning vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning so first im going to make just a request especially since youre on the call andy since i know this wouldnt happen without you i know you guys just put out your list of earnings calls dates for two of them overlap at exactly the same starting time as another major bank so im hoping that you can give jen and team the authorization to do something so that we all dont have to choose between which one to listen to since trying to listen to two is never going to work so since its one is in april and one is in october and its and months away im hoping between the two banks you all can find the time and i can followup with jen as to which those two are so thats just a us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp indiscernible vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah you know what we keep trying to and ive been told by ir if i dont ask the question on the call i cant get the answers to my questions so terry a little bit of color your hotel exposure can you give us some sense of the mix type of hotels urban versus small town upscale budget any color on that and also the percentage of criticized in your covidrelated exposures terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp thats a perfect question for mark mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah no ill share with the lodging exposure id say we have a great diversification by geography and property types its a mix between urban and suburban so weve got great distribution there and then so we feel really good with where thats at in terms of the criticized commitments for those impacted industries well have to followup and get you that offline vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats great and then mark im going to followup on credit a comment that i think terry made ncos to rise further but andy you said consumer chargeoffs to come more next year terrys comment was ncos to rise further in fourth quarter is that therefore still to come in commercial and which categories are you expecting that any color on that mark runkel a senior executive vice president chief credit officer us bancorp yeah i think as andy noted the consumer side continues to be very strong and our delinquencies where they ended the end of the quarter were in a really good spot so we think that will continue to hold true through the remainder of this year i think were continuing to work through some of those impacted industries on the commercial and commercial real estate side and really in the commercial real estate side its going to be more in the malls as well as our lodging exposure that well continue to work through through the remainder of this year terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp part of that vivek is mark and team being very active in terms of reducing our exposure where we think the highest risk categories are so as weve talked about in the past we try to be very proactive around this and managing our exposures down in a very early fashion vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay great thanks andy terry mark us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp thanks vivek andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from peter winter with wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning im just curious with the outlook for the unemployment rate to move higher would that suggest that there could be some additional reserve building in the fourth quarter terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah peter no that was something that has been a part of our outlook for when we were looking at the analysis in the second quarter and so we dont think that that would have any impact on cecl in fact at this particular point in time based upon what we know we wouldnt expect any additional reserve build peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay and then andy i look at the capital ratios and the reserve levels which are very strong if the fed were to lift that restriction on share buybacks and just keep it for the fourth quarter can you just talk about your view on buying back stock assuming no more fed restrictions andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp if we have capacity well do that peter were all the large banks are going through the ccar resubmission process right now i think that will inform a lot of us in terms of the feds direction into so thats what were looking at peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from christopher spahr with wells fargo securities andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi christopher christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning hi how are you good morning so regarding the payments growth this past quarter how much do you think of thats kind of green shoots and how much of that was kind of temporary say from the stimulus and what do you think is going to trend into the fourth quarter terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah certainly when you think about the third quarter i think the trajectory was helped because of the stimulus program and i think thats the reason why you saw such a strong kind of recovery from the second quarter so clearly its being impacted when you think about the fourth quarter i think the increase in sales levels will be more commensurate with what we have seen kind of precovid just in terms of the what i would call excluding the airline travel and entertainment so on a yearoveryear basis clearly its still going to be down because of those atrisk industries and the impact that consumer spend has had on that but regarding kind of the core other spend level its recovered very nicely christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then as a followup andy youve talked about your digital opportunities whether its merchant processing and b2b but your metrics that you give are mostly consumeroriented can you give some additional color on what you think could be like how your commercial customers changed their behavior and what do you think are going to be the revenue and expense benefits say in andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes christopher so i think the consumer probably is a little bit ahead of the corporate commercial in terms of migration to digital activities part of it is because many of them are already there and some of the new rails that are being built will impact that on a goforward basis so that continues to remain a huge opportunity probably more into as we think about the platform around merchant processing business banking treasury management and corporate payments all coming together to serve our corporate commercial and business customers so thats probably a little bit more a event and well continue to report on that for you so we could report our progress us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet operator your next question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question terry just sort of a quick question on your thoughts on liquidity deployment everybodys sort of i guess struggling with this high class problem of excess deposits just curious about how youre thinking about willingness or appetite to deploy some of that just given the challenging interest rate environment so just very top level question terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah again when you end up looking at kind of the investment alternatives that are out there you hate to kind of lock in to low rates over a long period of time so as a result i think youre going to see not only for us but in the industry liquidity levels being fairly high and waiting for the longer end of the curve to kind of come up a bit that said in the investment portfolio well look for opportunities to extend duration to some extent and to make some investments a little bit further out in the curve in order to be able to deploy it we feel like the liquidity levels that we have today are pretty good taking into consideration the incremental billion thatll come in which well keep pretty much on the short end r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then maybe on the other side of the balance sheet you can see through the ph ha data and in all the numbers that are coming out i mean everybodys kind of struggling with this evaporation of loan demand just curious at a high level what signs you guys are looking to or what sort of mile markers there are as to when that would begin to reverse so i guess the answers could be whether its vaccine election more certainty who knows but just curious given how much of the country you guys see what youre thinking andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp one of the greatest impacts in the third quarter was the bond issuance so if you think about the decline in corporate commercial about of that was from companies taking advantage of a low interest rate us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 environment and issuing debt and about was related to companies just reducing their balance sheet because they are seeing strong earnings theyre seeing high productivity so those two factors the debt issuance will really be a function of the interest rate environment and the yield curve going forward and i would expect that to moderate because there was so much activity in the third quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you guys very much i appreciate it andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp you bet terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp thanks scott operator your next question comes from ph david smith with autonomous terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp good morning ph david andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning q good morning first off you said that you expected the nonte card spend to have the growth recover to around where it was precovid but just in terms of the mix there are you still expecting a bigger mix in debit than was the case precovid terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp im sorry the second part of your question was q in terms of the mix in the consumer card spend between debit and credit are you still expecting the mix of debit versus credit to be more weighted towards debit in the near term terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2020 yeah i do i think that people again are being fairly cautious and so theyre utilizing the debit card because they can more effectively manage their liquidity so when they have cash balances in their savings account and as you know savings levels are fairly high still on the consumer side i think theyre using their debit card a little bit more than what they have in the past and so throughout the entire timeframe debit card sales have actually strengthened during that timeframe compared to credit card so i do think the mix would continue to change a little bit q and then on the branch closures it sounds like the gross savings there will be around million but are you expecting any onetime costs from stepping up the branch consolidation and can you help us get any sense of the timing and magnitude we might expect there terrance r dolan a vice chair chief financial officer us bancorp yeah so in the third quarter we did take a charge associated with the closure of the branches it is included in other revenue because its principally related to asset impairments offsetting that though were some equity investment gains that if you end up looking at those two things on
