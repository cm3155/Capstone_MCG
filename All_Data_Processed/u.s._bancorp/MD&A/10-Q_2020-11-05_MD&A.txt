lease values as of january the company expects net chargeoffs to increase given current economic conditions analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses prior to january the allowance for credit losses was established to reserve for probable and estimable losses incurred in the companys loan and lease portfolio including unfunded credit commitments effective january the company adopted new accounting guidance which changed previous impairment recognition to a model that is based on expected losses rather than incurred losses the allowance for credit losses is increased through provisions charged to earnings and reduced by net chargeoffs management evaluates the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses on a quarterly basis the allowance considers expected losses for the remaining lives of the applicable assets inclusive of expected recoveries remaining lives of the applicable assets are adjusted for prepayments multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which incorporates historical loss experience in years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining lives the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates which are both better and worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of future conditions final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels corporate bonds spreads and longterm interest rate forecasts as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on us bancorp commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that would affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans for commercial tdrs individually evaluated for impairment attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses however historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans commercial lending segment tdr loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history including defaults is a primary driver of the loss allocation the allowance recorded for tdr loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool the expected cash flows on tdr loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification the borrowers ability to pay under the restructured terms and the timing and amount of payments the allowance for collateraldependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and lines in a junior lien position the company considers the delinquency and modification status of the first lien at september the company serviced the first lien on percent of the home equity loans and lines in a junior lien position the company also considers the status of first lien mortgage accounts reported on customer credit bureau files when the first lien is not serviced by the company regardless of whether the company services the first lien an assessment is made of economic conditions problem loans recent loss experience and other factors in determining the allowance for credit losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at september represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified excluding loans in covidrelated forbearance programs the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified historically the number of junior lien defaults has been a small percentage of the total portfolio approximately percent annually while the longterm average loss rate on loans that default has been approximately percent in addition the company obtains updated credit scores on its home equity portfolio each quarter and in some cases more frequently and uses this information in its loss estimation methods in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status refreshed ltv ratios when possible and portfolio growth the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans are recognized through provision expense with future chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at september the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used as a result amounts determined us bancorp under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each portfolio class the results of the analysis are evaluated quarterly to confirm the estimates are appropriate for each loan portfolio although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at september the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at september compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at september compared with percent of full year net chargeoffs at december the increase in the allowance for credit losses of billion percent at september compared with december reflected the billion impact of the january adoption of new accounting guidance along with an additional billion increase during the first nine months of to recognize the expected losses resulting from the deteriorating and ongoing effects of adverse economic conditions driven by the impact of covid19 on the domestic and global economies as well as new loan production and acquired loans expected loss estimates consider various factors including the changing economic activity estimated mitigating effects of government stimulus estimated duration and severity of the health crisis customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and the impact of industrywide loan modification efforts designed to limit longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic among other factors changes in economic conditions as of september included significant reductions in economic activity related to actions taken by governmental authorities to slow the spread of covid19 high levels of unemployment and lower gross domestic product estimates for as well as a slower pace of recovery in manufacturing activity and oil prices were all observable changes in conditions that increased expected credit losses at the same time record economic stimulus measures were also enacted and additional measures are being considered with the intent to support businesses and consumers through what is expected to be a period of reduced economic activity to balance these offsetting factors economic scenarios updated through the end of the third quarter of that produced higher quantitative loss estimates consistent with the expected deterioration in reported economic statistics were evaluated in conjunction with managements expectation that current and potential future stimulus efforts as well as industrywide availability of shortterm payment deferral programs would mitigate losses estimated from models based on historical data from periods when mitigation efforts were not as extensive overall loss expectations are consistent with prior economic downturn experience but the severity of the deterioration in current economic conditions is not expected to persist over the life of the loan portfolio as some indicators of economic activity have begun to improve directionally the allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans increased billion during the nine months ended september as increased loan volume and credit downgrades during the period reflected the impact of covid19 on certain industry sectors including the retail and restaurants energy media and entertainment lodging and airline industries that were severely impacted by virus containment measures the following table summarizes the companys commercial lending segment credit exposure to customers within the industry sectors most impacted by covid19

from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customerrelated positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but

adverse market movements over a oneday time horizon the company uses the historical simulation method to calculate var for its covered positions measured at the ninetyninth percentile using a oneyear lookback period for distributions derived from past market data the market factors used in the calculations include those pertinent to market risks inherent in the underlying trading portfolios principally those that affect the companys corporate bond trading business foreign currency transaction business client derivatives business loan trading business and municipal securities business as well as those inherent in the companys foreign denominated balances and the derivatives used to mitigate the related measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys covered positions were as follows nine months ended september  in millions average

regulators the company considers various other measures when evaluating capital utilization and adequacy including tangible common equity to tangible assets tangible common equity to riskweighted assets and common equity tier capital to riskweighted assets reflecting the full implementation of the cecl methodology these capital measures are viewed by management as useful additional methods of evaluating the companys utilization of its capital held and the level of capital available to withstand unexpected negative market or economic conditions additionally us bancorp presentation of these measures allows investors analysts and banking regulators to assess the companys capital position relative to other financial services companies these capital measures are not defined in generally accepted accounting principles gaap or are not currently effective or defined in banking regulations in addition certain of these measures differ from currently effective capital ratios defined by banking regulations principally in that the currently effective ratios which are subject to certain transitional provisions temporarily exclude the impact of the adoption of accounting guidance related to impairment of financial instruments based on the cecl methodology as a result these capital measures disclosed by the company may be considered nongaap financial measures management believes this information helps investors assess trends in the companys capital adequacy the company also discloses net interest income and related ratios and analysis on a taxableequivalent basis which may also be considered nongaap financial measures the company believes this presentation to be the preferred industry measurement of net interest income as it provides a relevant comparison of net interest income arising from taxable and taxexempt sources in addition certain performance measures including the efficiency ratio and net interest margin utilize net interest income on a taxableequivalent basis there may be limits in the usefulness of these measures to investors as a result the company encourages readers to consider the consolidated financial statements and other

policies the accounting and reporting policies of the company comply with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and conform to general practices within the banking industry the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions the companys financial position and results of operations can be affected by these estimates and assumptions which are integral to understanding the companys financial statements critical accounting policies are those policies management believes are the most important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results and require management to make estimates that are difficult subjective or complex most accounting policies are not considered by management to be critical accounting policies management has discussed the development and the selection of critical accounting policies with the companys audit committee those policies considered to be critical accounting policies relate to the allowance for credit losses fair value estimates msrs and income taxes allowance for credit losses managements evaluation of the appropriate allowance for credit losses is often the most critical of all the accounting estimates for a banking institution it is an inherently subjective process impacted by many factors as discussed throughout the managements discussion and analysis section of this quarterly report on form 10q the methods utilized to estimate the allowance for credit losses key assumptions and quantitative and qualitative information considered by management in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses at september are discussed in the credit risk management section although methodologies utilized to determine each element of the allowance reflect managements assessment of credit risk as identified through assessments completed of individual credits and of homogenous pools affected by material credit events degrees of imprecision exist in these measurement tools due in part to subjective judgments involved and an inherent lag in the data available to quantify current conditions and events that affect credit loss reserve estimates as discussed in the analysis and determination of allowance for credit losses section management considered the effect of changes in economic conditions risk management practices and other factors that contributed to imprecision of loss estimates in determining the allowance for credit losses if not considered expected losses in the credit portfolio related to imprecision and other subjective factors could have a dramatic adverse impact on the liquidity and financial viability of a banking institution given the many quantitative variables and subjective factors affecting the credit portfolio changes in the allowance for credit losses may not directly coincide with changes in the risk ratings of the credit portfolio reflected in the risk rating process this is in part due to the timing of the risk rating process in relation to changes in the business cycle the exposure and mix of loans within risk rating categories levels of nonperforming loans and the timing of chargeoffs and expected recoveries the allowance for credit losses on commercial lending segment loans measures the expected loss content on the remaining portfolio exposure while nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs are measures of specific impairment events that have already been confirmed therefore the degree of change in the forwardlooking expected loss in the commercial lending allowance may differ from the level of changes in nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs management maintains an appropriate allowance for credit losses by updating allowance rates to reflect changes in expected losses including expected changes in economic or business cycle conditions some factors considered in determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses are more readily quantifiable while other factors require extensive qualitative judgment management conducts an analysis with respect to the accuracy of risk ratings and the volatility of expected losses and utilizes this analysis along with qualitative factors that can affect the precision of credit loss estimates including economic conditions such as changes in gross domestic product unemployment or bankruptcy rates and concentration risks such as risks associated with specific industries collateral valuations and loans to highly leveraged enterprises in determining the overall level of the allowance for credit losses the company considers a range of economic scenarios in its determination of the allowance for credit losses these scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses and also the expectation that conditions will eventually normalize over the longer run scenarios worse than the companys expected outcome at september include risks that government stimulus in response to the covid19 pandemic is less broad or less effective than expected or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed us bancorp the companys determination of the allowance for commercial lending segment loans is sensitive to the assigned credit risk ratings and expected loss rates at september if percent of period ending loan balances including unfunded commitments within each risk category of risk rated commercial lending loans experienced a downgrade to the next worse risk category the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at september if quantitative loss estimates for commercial lending segment loans increased by percent the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at september the company believes the allowance for credit losses appropriately considers the imprecision in estimating credit losses based on credit risk ratings and credit loss model estimates but actual losses may differ from those estimates the companys determination of the allowance for consumer lending segment loans is sensitive to changes in estimated loss rates and estimated impairments on restructured loans in the event that estimated losses for this segment of the loan portfolio increased by percent the allowance for credit losses would have increased by approximately million at september because several quantitative and qualitative factors are considered in determining the allowance for credit losses these sensitivity analyses do not necessarily reflect the nature and extent of future changes in the allowance for credit losses they are intended to provide insights into the impact of adverse changes in risk rating and loss model estimates and do not imply any expectation of future deterioration in the risk rating or loss rates given current processes employed by the company management believes the risk ratings and loss model estimates currently assigned are appropriate it is possible that others given the same information may at any point in time reach different reasonable conclusions that could be significant to the companys financial statements refer to the analysis and determination of the allowance for credit losses section for further information accounting
