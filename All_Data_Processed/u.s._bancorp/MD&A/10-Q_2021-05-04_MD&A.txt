discussion of liquidity management of the company corporate risk profile overview managing risks is an essential part of successfully operating a financial services company the companys board of directors has approved a risk management framework which establishes governance and risk management requirements for all risktaking activities this framework includes company and business line risk appetite statements which set boundaries for the types and amount of risk that may be undertaken in pursuing business objectives and initiatives the board of directors primarily through its risk management committee oversees performance relative to the risk management framework risk appetite statements and other policy requirements the executive risk committee erc which is chaired by the chief risk officer and includes the chief executive officer and other members of the executive management team oversees execution against the risk management framework and risk appetite statements the erc focuses on current and emerging risks including strategic and reputation risks by directing timely and comprehensive actions senior operating committees have also been established each responsible for overseeing a specified category of risk the companys most prominent risk exposures are credit interest rate market liquidity operational compliance strategic and reputation leveraging the companys risk management framework the specific impacts of covid19 and related risks are identified for each of the most prominent exposures with respect to direct impacts from covid19 oversight and governance is managed through a centralized command center with frequent reporting to the managing us bancorp committee and erc the board of directors also oversees the companys responsiveness to the covid19 pandemic credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a change in the credit profile or the failure of a borrower or counterparty to meet its contractual obligations interest rate risk is the potential reduction of net interest income or market valuations as a result of changes in interest rates market risk arises from fluctuations in interest rates foreign exchange rates and security prices that may result in changes in the values of financial instruments such as trading and availableforsale securities mortgage loans held for sale mlhfs msrs and derivatives that are accounted for on a fair value basis liquidity risk is the possible inability to fund obligations or new business at a reasonable cost and in a timely manner operational risk is the risk to current or projected

may impact the company refer to risk factors in the companys annual report on s as well as the potential impact on customers and the domestic economy resulting from the covid19 pandemic the risk management committee oversees the companys credit risk management process in addition credit quality ratings as defined by the company are an important part of the companys overall credit risk management and evaluation of its allowance for credit losses loans with a pass rating represent those loans not classified on the companys rating scale for problem credits as minimal credit risk has been identified loans with a special mention or classified rating including consumer lending and small business loans that are days or more past due and still accruing nonaccrual loans those loans considered troubled debt restructurings tdrs and loans in a junior lien position that are current but are behind a first lien position on nonaccrual encompass all loans held by the company that it considers to have a potential or welldefined weakness that may put full collection of contractual cash flows at risk the companys internal credit quality ratings for consumer loans are primarily based on delinquency and nonperforming status except for a limited population of larger loans within those portfolios that are individually evaluated for this limited population the determination of the internal credit quality rating may also consider collateral value and customer cash flows refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the companys loan portfolios including internal credit quality ratings in addition refer to managements discussion and analysis credit risk management in the companys annual report on s and other macroeconomic factors customer payment history and credit scores and in some cases updated loantovalue ltv information reflecting current us bancorp market conditions on real estatebased loans these and other risk characteristics including elevated risk resulting from the covid19 pandemic are reflected in forecasts of delinquency levels bankruptcies and losses which are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses for the consumer lending segment the company further disaggregates its loan portfolio segments into various classes based on their underlying risk characteristics the two classes within the commercial lending segment are commercial loans and commercial real estate loans the three classes within the consumer lending segment are residential mortgages credit card loans and other retail loans the companys consumer lending segment utilizes several distinct business processes and channels to originate consumer credit including traditional branch lending mobile and online banking indirect lending alliance partnerships correspondent banks and loan brokers each distinct underwriting and origination activity manages unique credit risk characteristics and prices its loan production commensurate with the differing risk profiles residential mortgage originations are generally limited to prime borrowers and are performed through the companys branches loan production offices mobile and online services and a wholesale network of originators the company may retain residential mortgage loans it originates on its balance sheet or sell the loans into the secondary market while retaining the servicing rights and customer relationships utilizing the secondary markets enables the company to effectively reduce its credit and other assetliability risks for residential mortgages that are retained in the companys portfolio and for home equity and second mortgages credit risk is also diversified by geography and managed by adherence to ltv and borrower credit criteria during the underwriting process the company estimates updated ltv information on its outstanding residential mortgages quarterly based on a method that combines automated valuation model updates and relevant home price indices ltv is the ratio of the loans outstanding principal balance to the current estimate of property value for home equity and second mortgages combined loantovalue cltv is the combination of the first mortgage original principal balance and the second lien outstanding principal balance relative to the current estimate of property value certain loans do not have an ltv or cltv primarily due to lack of availability of relevant automated valuation model andor home price indices values or lack of necessary valuation data on acquired loans the

segment tdrs generally include extensions of the maturity date and may be accompanied by an increase or decrease to the interest rate the company may also work with the borrower to make other changes to the loan to mitigate losses such as obtaining additional collateral andor guarantees to support the loan the company has also implemented certain residential mortgage loan restructuring programs that may result in tdrs the company modifies residential mortgage loans under federal housing administration united states department of veterans affairs and its own internal programs under these

or in limited situations partial forgiveness of loan principal in most instances participation in residential mortgage loan restructuring programs requires the customer to complete a shortterm trial period a permanent loan modification is contingent on the customer successfully completing the trial period us bancorp arrangement and the loan documents are not modified until that time the company reports loans in a trial period arrangement as tdrs and continues to report them as tdrs after the trial period credit card and other retail loan tdrs are generally part of distinct restructuring programs providing customers modification solutions over a specified time period generally up to months in accordance with regulatory guidance the company considers secured consumer loans that have

multiple economic scenarios are considered over a threeyear reasonable and supportable forecast period which includes increasing consideration of historical loss experience over years two and three these economic scenarios are constructed with interrelated projections of multiple economic variables and loss estimates are produced that consider the historical correlation of those economic variables with credit losses after the forecast period the company fully reverts to longterm historical loss experience adjusted for prepayments and characteristics of the current loan and lease portfolio to estimate losses over the remaining life of the portfolio the economic scenarios are updated at least quarterly and are designed to provide a range of reasonable estimates which are both better and worse than current expectations scenarios are weighted based on the companys expectation of economic conditions for the foreseeable future and reflect significant judgment and consider uncertainties that exist final loss estimates also consider factors affecting credit losses not reflected in the scenarios due to the unique aspects of current conditions and expectations these factors may include but are not limited to loan servicing practices regulatory guidance andor fiscal and monetary policy actions because business processes and credit risks associated with unfunded credit commitments are essentially the same as for loans the company utilizes similar processes to estimate its liability for unfunded credit commitments which is included in other liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet both the allowance for loan losses and the liability for unfunded credit commitments are included in the companys analysis of credit losses and reported reserve ratios the allowance recorded for credit losses utilizes forwardlooking expected loss models to consider a variety of factors affecting lifetime credit losses these factors include but are not limited to macroeconomic variables such as unemployment rates real estate prices gross domestic product levels corporate bonds spreads and longterm interest rate forecasts as well as loan and borrower characteristics such as internal risk ratings on commercial loans and consumer credit scores delinquency status collateral type and available valuation information consideration of endofterm losses on lease residuals and the remaining term of the loan adjusted for expected prepayments for each loan portfolio model estimates are adjusted as necessary to consider any relevant changes in portfolio composition lending policies underwriting standards risk management practices economic conditions or other factors that may affect the accuracy of the model expected credit loss estimates also include consideration of expected cash recoveries on loans previously chargedoff or expected recoveries on collateraldependent loans where recovery is expected through sale of the collateral where loans do not exhibit similar risk characteristics an individual analysis is performed to consider expected credit losses the allowance recorded for individually evaluated loans greater than million in the commercial lending segment is based on an analysis utilizing expected cash us bancorp flows discounted using the original effective interest rate the observable market price of the loan or the fair value of the collateral less selling costs for collateraldependent loans as appropriate for commercial tdrs individually evaluated for impairment attributes of the borrower are the primary factors in determining the allowance for credit losses however historical loss experience is also incorporated into the allowance methodology applied to this category of loans commercial lending segment tdr loans may be collectively evaluated for impairment where observed performance history including defaults is a primary driver of the loss allocation the allowance recorded for tdr loans in the consumer lending segment is determined on a homogenous pool basis utilizing expected cash flows discounted using the original effective interest rate of the pool the expected cash flows on tdr loans consider subsequent payment defaults since modification the borrowers ability to pay under the restructured terms and the timing and amount of payments the allowance for collateraldependent loans in the consumer lending segment is determined based on the current fair value of the collateral less costs to sell when evaluating the appropriateness of the allowance for credit losses for any loans and

losses based on the available information the company estimated million or percent of its total home equity portfolio at march represented nondelinquent junior liens where the first lien was delinquent or modified excluding loans in covidrelated forbearance programs the company considers historical loss experience on the loans and lines in a junior lien position to establish loss estimates for junior lien loans and lines the company services that are current but the first lien is delinquent or modified the historical longterm average loss experience related to junior liens has been relatively limited less than percent of the total portfolio annually and estimates are adjusted to consider current collateral support and portfolio risk characteristics these include updated credit scores and collateral estimates obtained on the companys home equity portfolio each quarter in its evaluation of the allowance for credit losses the company also considers the increased risk of loss associated with home equity lines that are contractually scheduled to convert from a revolving status to a fully amortizing payment beginning january when a loan portfolio is purchased the acquired loans are divided into those considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration pcd and those not considered purchased with more than insignificant credit deterioration an allowance is established for each population and considers product mix risk characteristics of the portfolio bankruptcy experience delinquency status and refreshed ltv ratios when possible the allowance established for purchased loans not considered pcd is recognized through provision expense upon acquisition whereas the allowance established for loans considered pcd at acquisition is offset by an increase in the basis of the acquired loans any subsequent increases and decreases in the allowance related to purchased loans regardless of pcd status are recognized through provision expense with chargeoffs charged to the allowance the company did not have a material amount of pcd loans included in its loan portfolio at march the companys methodology for determining the appropriate allowance for credit losses also considers the imprecision inherent in the methodologies used and allocated to the various loan portfolios as a result amounts determined under the methodologies described above are adjusted by management to consider the potential impact of other qualitative factors not captured in quantitative model adjustments which include but are not limited to the following model imprecision imprecision in economic scenario assumptions and emerging risks related to either changes in the economic environment that are affecting specific portfolios or changes in portfolio concentrations over time that may affect model performance the consideration of these items results in adjustments to allowance amounts included in the companys allowance for credit losses for each loan portfolio although the company determined the amount of each element of the allowance separately and considers this process to be an important credit management tool the entire allowance for credit losses is available for the entire loan portfolio the actual amount of losses can vary significantly from the estimated amounts at march the allowance for credit losses was billion percent of periodend loans compared with an allowance of billion percent of periodend loans at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to nonperforming loans was percent at march compared with percent at december the ratio of the allowance for credit losses to annualized loan net chargeoffs was percent at march compared with percent of full year net chargeoffs at december us

enactment of additional benefits from government stimulus programs vaccine availability in the united states and reduced levels of new covid19 cases in addition to these factors expected loss estimates consider various factors including customer specific information impacting changes in risk ratings projected delinquencies and the impact of industrywide loan modification efforts designed to limit longterm effects of the covid19 pandemic among other factors currently consumer credit trends continue to perform better than expected although select commercial portfolios most impacted by covid19 continue to be monitored for structural shifts associated with the pandemic changes in economic conditions during the first quarter of included improvements in projected gross domestic product and unemployment levels for which reflected the additional government stimulus and availability of vaccines these factors are evaluated through a combination of quantitative calculations using economic scenarios and qualitative assessments that consider the high degree of uncertainty related to the unprecedented levels of both economic stress and the stimulus response the following table

credit quality and mix changes and changes in general economic conditions and expectations including for unemployment and gross domestic product among other factors based on economic conditions at march it was difficult to estimate the length and severity of the economic downturn that may result from covid19 and the impact of other factors that may influence the level of eventual losses and corresponding requirements for the allowance for credit losses including the impact of economic stimulus programs and customer accommodation activity while reserves consider the uncertainty in these estimates the unpredictability of the covid19 pandemic could result in the recognition of credit losses in the companys loan portfolios and increases in the allowance for credit losses scenarios worse than the companys expected outcome at march include risks that government stimulus in response to the covid19 pandemic is less effective than expected or that a longer or more severe health crisis prolongs the downturn in economic activity potentially reducing the number of businesses that are ultimately able to resume operations after the crisis has passed other factors considered include the potential of rising interest rates and unsupported increases in the values of certain assets the allowance for credit losses related to commercial lending segment loans decreased million during the

within guidelines established by its asset liability management committee alco and approved by the board of directors the alco has the responsibility for approving and ensuring compliance with the alco management policies including interest rate risk exposure one way the company measures and analyzes its interest rate risk is through net interest income simulation analysis simulation analysis

fluctuations asset and liability management positions the company enters into derivative transactions the company uses derivatives for asset and liability management purposes primarily in the following ways to convert fixedrate debt and availableforsale investment securities from fixedrate payments to floatingrate payments to convert floatingrate debt from floatingrate payments to fixedrate payments to mitigate changes in value of the companys unfunded mortgage loan commitments funded mlhfs and msrs to mitigate remeasurement volatility of foreign currency denominated balances and to mitigate the volatility of the companys net investment in foreign operations driven by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in addition the company enters into interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts to support the business requirements of its customers customerrelated positions the company minimizes the market and liquidity risks of customerrelated positions by either entering into similar offsetting positions with brokerdealers or on a portfolio basis by entering into other derivative or nonderivative financial instruments that partially or fully offset the exposure from these customerrelated positions the company may enter into derivative contracts that are either exchangetraded centrally cleared through clearinghouses or overthecounter the company does not utilize derivatives for speculative purposes the company does not designate all of the derivatives that it enters into for risk management purposes as accounting hedges because of the inefficiency of applying the accounting requirements and may instead elect fair value accounting for the related hedged items in particular the company enters into interest rate swaps swaptions forward commitments to buy tobeannounced securities tbas us treasury and eurodollar futures and options on us treasury futures to mitigate fluctuations in the value of its msrs but does not designate those derivatives as accounting hedges additionally the company uses forward commitments to sell tbas and other commitments to sell residential mortgage loans at specified prices to economically hedge

credit risk associated with derivatives is measured by the company based on the probability of counterparty default including consideration of the covid19 pandemic the company manages the credit risk of its derivative positions by diversifying its positions among various counterparties by entering into master netting arrangements and where possible by requiring collateral arrangements the company may also transfer counterparty credit risk related to interest rate swaps to third parties through the use of risk participation agreements in addition certain interest rate swaps interest rate

measurement volatility on average the company expects the oneday var to be exceeded by actual losses two to three times per year related to these positions the company monitors the accuracy of internal var models and modeling processes by backtesting model performance regularly updating the historical data used by the var models and regular model validations to assess the accuracy of the models input processing and reporting components all models are required to be independently reviewed and approved prior to being placed in use if the company were to experience market losses in excess of the estimated var more often than expected the var models and associated assumptions would be analyzed and adjusted the average high low and periodend oneday var amounts for the companys
