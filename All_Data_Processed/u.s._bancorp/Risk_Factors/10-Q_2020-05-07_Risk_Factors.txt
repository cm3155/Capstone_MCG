of the companys annual report on form 10k for the year ended december other than the addition of the following risk factor the companys business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations have been and will likely continue to be adversely affected by the covid19 pandemic the covid19 pandemic has created economic and financial disruptions that have adversely affected and are likely to continue to adversely affect the companys business financial condition capital liquidity and results of operations the company cannot predict at this time the extent to which it will continue to be negatively affected by the covid19 pandemic the extent of any continued or future adverse effects of the covid19 pandemic will depend on future developments which are highly uncertain and outside the companys control including the scope and duration of the pandemic the direct and indirect impact of the pandemic on the companys employees clients counterparties and service providers as well as other market participants and actions taken by governmental authorities and other third parties in response to the pandemic many of the companys counterparties and thirdparty service providers have been and may further be affected by stayathome orders market volatility and other factors that increase their risks of business disruption or that may otherwise affect their ability to perform under the terms of any agreements with the company or provide essential services as a result the companys operational and other risks are generally expected to increase until the pandemic subsides in addition the companys business operations may be disrupted if significant portions of its workforce are unable to work effectively including because of illness quarantines government actions or other restrictions in connection with the pandemic the company has already temporarily closed certain of its offices and reduced operating hours andor lobby services at its branches the company may also face heightened cybersecurity information security or other operational risks resulting from alternative working arrangements of its employees in response to the pandemic and to support its customers the company is offering fee waivers payment deferrals and other expanded assistance to credit card automobile mortgage small business and personal lending customers including committing in certain states in which it operates to suspend mortgage payments and foreclosure sales for financially impacted customers for certain periods of time the company anticipates that a significant number of its customers will seek to suspend their mortgage payments under these programs suspensions of mortgage payments and foreclosures and reduced pricing under these programs may adversely affect the companys revenue and results of operations in addition if these or other measures provided by the company are not effective in mitigating the financial consequences of covid19 on customers including providing loans under various newly created governmentsponsored lending programs such as the paycheck protection program the company may experience higher rates of default and increased credit losses in future periods certain industries where the company has credit exposure including the transportation industry and in particular air travel have experienced significant operational challenges as a result of covid19 these negative effects have resulted in a number of corporate lending clients making higher than usual draws on outstanding lines of credit which may negatively affect the companys liquidity if current economic conditions persist the economic effects of covid19 may also cause the companys commercial customers to be unable to pay their loans as they come due or decrease the value of collateral which the company expects would cause significant increases in its credit losses in addition the company could be exposed to further losses in its role as merchant processor of credit card transactions as under the rules of credit card associations a merchant processor retains a contingent liability for credit card transactions processed in the event a merchant was unable to fulfill product or services subject to future delivery such as airline tickets the company could become financially liable for refunding to the cardholders the purchase price of such products or services purchased through credit card associations in the event the merchant was not able to do so us bancorp net interest income is significantly affected by market rates of interest the significant reductions to the federal funds rate have led to a decrease in the rates and yields on us treasury securities in some cases declining below zero if interest rates are reduced further in response to covid19 the companys net interest income could continue to decline perhaps significantly the overall effect of lower interest rates cannot be predicted at this time and depends on future actions the federal reserve may take to increase or reduce the targeted federal funds rate in response to the covid19 pandemic and resulting economic conditions the company through its subsidiaries provides credit and debit card corporate payments products and merchant processing services revenues from its payment services businesses depend on consumer and business credit card spending including at many small and mediumsized businesses due to responses to covid19 including stayathome orders that require businesses other than those defined as essential to close and for consumers to remain at home unless they are engaged in essential activities consumer and business credit card spending has significantly declined if these conditions persist the company expects to experience adverse effects on its payment services businesses this negative effect could continue after the pandemic subsides if a substantial number of businesses were to close permanently as a result of covid19s economic effects or if consumer and business spending were to remain depressed the effects of the covid19 pandemic on economic and market conditions have increased demands on the companys liquidity as it meets its customers needs in addition these adverse developments may negatively affect its capital and leverage ratios in march the company announced that it was suspending stock repurchases through the second quarter of to preserve capital and liquidity in order to support customers employees and shareholders the covid19 pandemic may cause the company to further reduce capital distributions andor extend the suspension of its share repurchase program and although not currently contemplated reduce or suspend its common stock dividend governmental authorities worldwide have taken unprecedented measures to stabilize the markets and support economic growth the success of these measures is unknown and they may not be sufficient to address the negative economic effects of covid19 or avert severe and prolonged reductions in economic activity other negative effects of covid19 and the resulting economic and market disruptions including customer disputes litigation and governmental and regulatory scrutiny of response actions taken by the company that may impact the companys business reputation financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations cannot be predicted at this time however it is likely that the companys business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations will continue to be adversely affected until the pandemic subsides and the domestic economy begins to recover further the covid19 pandemic may also have the effect of heightening many of the other risks described in the section entitled risk factors in the companys annual report on form 10k until the pandemic subsides the company expects continued draws on lines of credit reduced revenues from its lending businesses increased credit losses in its lending portfolios and decreased revenue from its payments businesses even after the pandemic subsides it is possible that the domestic and other major global economies continue to experience a prolonged recession which the company expects would adversely affect its business financial condition liquidity capital and results of operations potentially materially
