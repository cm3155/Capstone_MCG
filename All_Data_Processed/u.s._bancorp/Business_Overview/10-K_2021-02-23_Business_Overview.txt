applicable to the company including changes in their interpretation or implementation could have a material effect on its business or organization as a bank holding company with over billion in total consolidated assets the company is subject to the doddfrank acts enhanced prudential standards requirements the doddfrank act as amended by the economic growth regulatory relief and consumer protection act egrrcpa however mandated that the federal reserve tailor the enhanced prudential standards applicable to a bank holding company or category of bank holding companies based on several factors including size capital structure complexity and other riskrelated factors in october the federal banking regulators adopted two final rules the tailoring rules that revised the criteria for determining the applicability of regulatory capital and liquidity requirements for large united states banking organizations including the company and us bank national association and that tailored the application of the federal reserves enhanced prudential standards to large banking organizations the rules applicable to the company and us bank national association are described in more detail below supervisory ratings federal banking regulators regularly examine the company and us bank national association to evaluate their financial condition and monitor their compliance with laws and regulatory policies following those exams the company and us bank national association are assigned supervisory ratings these ratings are considered confidential supervisory information and disclosure to third parties is not allowed without permission of the issuing regulator violations of laws and regulations or deemed deficiencies in risk management or compliance practices may be incorporated into these supervisory ratings a downgrade in these ratings could limit the companys ability to pursue acquisitions or conduct other expansionary activities for a period of time require new or additional regulatory approvals before engaging in certain other business activities or investments affect us bank national associations deposit insurance assessment rate and impose additional recordkeeping and corporate governance requirements as well as generally increase regulatory scrutiny of the company in november the federal reserve adopted the large financial institution rating system lfi rating system which replaced the prior rating system for large financial institutions including the company and aligned the supervisory rating system with the federal reserves supervisory programs for these firms as compared to the rating system it replaced which continues to be used for smaller bank holding companies the lfi rating system places a greater emphasis on capital and liquidity including related planning and risk management practices ratings issued under the lfi rating system will remain confidential the federal reserve has also proposed guidance for the governance and controls component of the lfi rating system that addresses the role of boards of directors as well as the responsibilities of members of senior and business line management and controls at large financial institutions bank holding company activities the company is a bank holding company under the bhc act and has elected to be a financial holding company pursuant to the provisions of the grammleachbliley act the glba under the glba bank holding companies that qualify and elect to be treated as financial holding companies may engage in and affiliate with financial companies engaging in a broader range of activities than would otherwise be permitted for a bank holding company under the glbas system of functional regulation the federal reserve acts as an umbrella regulator for the company and certain of the companys nonbank subsidiaries are primarily regulated directly by additional agencies based on the particular activities of those subsidiaries if a financial holding company or a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company ceases to be wellcapitalized or wellmanaged the federal reserve may impose corrective capital and managerial requirements on the financial holding company and may place limitations on its ability to conduct all of the business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and its ability to make certain acquisitions see permissible business activities below if the failure to meet these standards persists the financial holding company may be required to divest its depository institution subsidiaries or cease all activities other than those activities that may be conducted by bank holding companies that are not financial holding companies in addition if a depository institution controlled by a financial holding company does not receive a community reinvestment act cra rating of at least satisfactory at its most recent examination the federal reserve will prohibit the financial holding company from conducting new business activities that financial holding companies are generally permitted to conduct and from making certain acquisitions the federal reserve also requires bank holding companies to meet certain applicable capital and management standards failure by the company to meet these standards could limit the company from engaging in any new activity or acquiring other companies without the prior approval of the federal reserve permissible business activities as a financial holding company the company may affiliate with securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature or incidental or complementary to activities that are financial in nature financial in nature activities include securities underwriting dealing and market making sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies insurance underwriting and agency merchant banking and activities that the federal reserve in consultation with the secretary of the united states treasury determines to be financial in nature or incidental to such financial activity complementary activities are activities that the federal reserve determines upon application to be complementary to a financial activity and that do not pose a safety and soundness risk the company generally is not required to obtain federal reserve approval to acquire a company other than a bank holding company bank or savings association engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature as determined by the federal reserve as long as the company meets the capital managerial and cra requirements to qualify as a financial holding company however the company is required to receive approval for an acquisition in which the total consolidated assets to be acquired exceed billion financial holding companies are also required to obtain the approval of the federal reserve before they may acquire more than five percent of the voting shares or substantially all of the assets of an unaffiliated bank holding company bank or savings association in addition banks must receive approval before they may acquire merge with acquire substantially all of the assets of or assume any deposits of a bank or savings association and may be required to receive approval for acquisitions of other companies interstate banking a bank holding company may acquire banks in states other than its home state subject to any state requirement that the bank has been organized and operating for a minimum period of time not to exceed five years also such an acquisition is not permitted if the bank holding company controls prior to or following the proposed acquisition more than percent of the total amount of deposits of insured depository institutions nationwide or if the acquisition is the bank holding companys initial entry into the state more than percent of the deposits of insured depository institutions in the state or any lesser or greater amount set by the state banks may merge across state lines to create interstate branches and are permitted to establish new branches in another state to the same extent as banks chartered by that state regulatory approval for acquisitions in determining whether to approve a proposed bank acquisition federal bank regulators will consider a number of factors including the effect of the acquisition on competition financial condition and future prospects including current and projected capital ratios and levels the competence experience and integrity of management and its record of compliance with laws and regulations the convenience and needs of the communities to be served including the acquiring institutions record of compliance under the cra the effectiveness of the acquiring institution in combating money laundering activities and the extent to which the transaction would result in greater or more concentrated risks to the stability of the united states banking or financial system in addition approval of interstate transactions requires that the acquiror satisfy regulatory standards for wellcapitalized and wellmanaged institutions source of strength the company is required to act as a source of strength to us bank national association and to commit capital and financial resources to support this subsidiary in circumstances where it might not otherwise do so under these requirements the federal reserve may in the future require the company to provide financial assistance to us bank national association should it experience financial distress capital loans by the company to us bank national association would be subordinate in right of payment to deposits and certain other debts of us bank national association in the event of the companys bankruptcy any commitment by the company to a federal bank regulatory agency to maintain the capital of us bank national association would be assumed by the bankruptcy trustee and entitled to a priority of payment occ heightened standards the occ has issued guidelines establishing heightened standards for large national banks such as us bank national association the guidelines establish minimum standards for the design and implementation of a risk governance framework for banks the occ may take action against institutions that fail to meet these standards enhanced prudential standards under the doddfrank act as modified by the egrrcpa and the tailoring rules large bank holding companies such as the company are subject to certain enhanced prudential standards based on the banking organizations size status as a global systemically important bank crossjurisdictional activity weighted shortterm wholesale funding nonbank assets and offbalance sheet exposures the prudential standards include enhanced riskbased capital and leverage requirements enhanced liquidity requirements enhanced risk management and risk committee requirements a requirement to submit a resolution plan singlecounterparty credit limits and stress tests these standards also require the federal reserve to impose a maximum 15to1 debttoequity ratio on a bank holding company with total consolidated assets of billion or more if the financial stability oversight council determines that the company poses a grave threat to the financial stability of the united states and that the imposition of such a debttoequity requirement would mitigate such risk in addition the federal reserve is required to establish early remediation requirements for bank holding companies with total consolidated assets of billion or more but these requirements have not yet been finalized certain of the enhanced prudential standards applicable to the company are described below in further detail including changes that have been made to these requirements under the tailoring rules dividend restrictions the company is a legal entity separate and distinct from its subsidiaries typically the majority of the companys operating funds are received in the form of dividends paid to the company by us bank national association federal law imposes limitations on the payment of dividends by national banks in general dividends payable by us bank national association and the companys trust bank subsidiaries as national banking associations are limited by rules that compare dividends to net income for periods defined by regulation the occ the federal reserve and the fdic also have authority to prohibit or limit the payment of dividends by the banking organizations they supervise including the company and us bank national association if in the banking regulators opinion payment of a dividend would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice in light of the financial condition of the banking organization in march the federal reserve approved a final rule replacing the static percent component of the capital conservation buffer with the stress capital buffer scb for bank holding companies with billion or more in total consolidated assets such as the company the scb reflects stressed losses in the supervisory severely adverse scenario of the ccar stress tests described in more detail in stress testing below and includes four quarters of planned common stock dividends the scb is subject to a percent floor a firms scb requirement is generally effective on october of each year and remains in effect until october of the following year unless the firms scb is reset in connection with a resubmission of a capital plan the companys first scb requirement of percent took effect on october the final rule implementing the scb also provides that a bank holding company must receive prior approval for any dividend stock repurchase or other capital distribution other than a capital distribution on a newly issued capital instrument if the bank holding company is required to resubmit its capital plan in connection with the november resubmission described under comprehensive capital analysis and review below the federal reserve required those bank holding companies including the company to suspend stock repurchases during the third and fourth quarters of and not to increase common stock dividends or pay common stock dividends in excess of their average net income over the past four quarters in december the federal reserve announced that these bank holding companies could continue existing dividend payments and resume stock repurchases in the first quarter of as long as the combined amounts of repurchases and dividends in that quarter do not exceed the bank holding companys average earnings per quarter over the last four quarters capital requirements the company is subject to certain regulatory riskbased capital and leverage requirements under capital rules adopted by the federal reserve and us bank national association is subject to substantially similar rules adopted by the occ these rules implement the basel committees framework for strengthening the regulation supervision and risk management of banks basel iii as well as certain provisions of the doddfrank act these quantitative calculations are minimums and the federal reserve and occ may determine that a banking organization based on its size complexity or risk profile must maintain a higher level of capital in order to operate in a safe and sound manner under the tailoring rules the company and us bank national association are each subject to category iii standards because they are not subject to category i or category ii standards and have at least billion in total consolidated assets accordingly the company and us bank national association are standardized approach banking organizations as standardized approach banking organizations the company and us bank national association are subject to the final rule adopted by the banking regulators in july relating to simplifications of the capital rules applicable to nonadvanced approach organizations these rules became effective on january and provide for simplified capital requirements relating to the threshold deductions for mortgage servicing assets deferred tax assets arising from temporary differences that a banking organization could not realize through net operating loss carry backs and investments in the capital of unconsolidated financial institutions as well as the inclusion of minority interests in regulatory capital under the united states basel iiibased capital rules the company is subject to a minimum common equity tier cet1 capital ratio cet1 capital to riskweighted assets of percent a minimum tier capital ratio of percent and a minimum total capital ratio of percent the company is also subject to the scb which is based on the results of the federal reserves supervisory stress tests and the companys planned common stock dividends and if deployed by the federal reserve up to a percent common equity tier countercyclical capital buffer these additional requirements must be satisfied entirely with capital that qualifies as cet1 the countercyclical capital buffer applies only to banking organizations subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company although the federal reserve has not to date raised the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent the countercyclical capital buffer could change in the future the scb replaces the static percent component of the capital conservation buffer and is likely to vary over time as of december the scb applicable to the company is percent if the federal reserve were to raise the countercyclical capital buffer above zero percent or if the scb applicable to the company were to exceed percent this would also change the effective minimum capital ratios to which the company is subject banking organizations that fail to meet the effective minimum ratios will be subject to constraints on capital distributions including dividends and share repurchases and certain discretionary executive compensation with the severity of the constraints depending on the extent of the shortfall and eligible retained income since march defined as the greater of i net income for the four preceding quarters net of distributions and associated tax effects not reflected in net income and ii the average of all net income over the preceding four quarters with progressively more stringent constraints on capital actions as the company approaches the minimum ratios united states banking organizations are also subject to a minimum tier leverage ratio of percent banking organizations subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules including the company are also subject to a minimum supplementary leverage ratio slr of percent that takes into account both onbalance sheet and certain offbalance sheet exposures at december the company exceeded the applicable minimum tier leverage ratio and slr requirements in december the basel committee finalized a package of revisions to the basel iii framework the changes are meant to improve the calculation of riskweighted assets including by recalibrating risk weights and introducing new capital requirements for certain unconditionally cancellable commitments including unused lines of credit and improve the comparability of capital ratios by i enhancing the robustness and risk sensitivity of the standardized approaches for credit risk credit valuation adjustment cva risk and operational risk ii constraining the use of the internal model approaches by placing limits on certain inputs used to calculate capital requirements under the internal ratingsbased irb approach for credit risk and by removing the use of the internal model approaches for cva risk and for operational risk iii introducing a leverage ratio buffer to further limit the leverage of global systemically important banks gsibs and iv replacing the existing basel ii output floor with a more robust risksensitive floor based on the committees revised basel iii standardized approaches under the basel standards the implementation date for the revised standardized approach for credit risk and leverage ratios as well as the irb cva operational risk and market risk frameworks is january in addition in january the basel committee published a revised market risk framework that among other things revises the standardized approach for market risk the output floor will be subject to a transitional period beginning in january with full implementation by january the effects of these revisions on the company and us bank national association will depend on the manner in which they are implemented by the united states federal banking agencies during the united states federal banking agencies adopted a rule that allows banking organizations including the company and us bank national association to elect to delay temporarily the estimated effects of adopting the current expected credit loss accounting standard cecl on regulatory capital until january and subsequently to phase in the effects through january the federal reserve has also stated that it will not incorporate cecl into the calculation of the allowance for credit losses in supervisory stress tests through the stress test cycle for further discussion of cecl see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements in the annual report the company and us bank national association elected to delay and subsequently phase in the regulatory capital impact of cecl in accordance with this rule for additional information regarding the companys regulatory capital see capital management in the annual report comprehensive capital analysis and review as required by the federal reserves ccar rules the company submits a capital plan to the federal reserve on an annual basis as part of the ccar process the federal reserve evaluates the companys plans to make capital distributions including by repurchasing stock or making dividend payments under a number of macroeconomic and companyspecific assumptions based on the companys and the federal reserves stress tests described under stress testing below these capital plans consist of a number of mandatory elements including an assessment of a companys sources and uses of capital over a ninequarter planning horizon assuming both expected and stressful conditions a detailed description of a companys process for assessing capital adequacy and a demonstration of a companys ability to maintain capital above each minimum regulatory capital ratio without taking the buffers into account under expected and stressful conditions in june all bank holding companies participating in ccar including the company were required by the federal reserve to resubmit their capital plans in november in light of the ongoing economic effects of the covid19 pandemic after reviewing the resubmitted capital plans in december the federal reserve announced that these bank holding companies including the company could continue existing dividend payments and resume stock repurchases in the first quarter of as long as the combined amounts of repurchases and dividends in that quarter do not exceed the bank holding companys average earnings per quarter over the last four quarters stress testing the federal reserves ccar framework and the doddfrank act stress testing framework require bank holding companies subject to category iii standards such as the company to conduct an annual internal stress test in connection with its annual capital plan submission as well as biennial companyrun stress tests and subject such bank holding companies to annual supervisory stress tests conducted by the federal reserve among other things the companyrun stress tests employ stress scenarios developed by the company as well as stress scenarios provided by the federal reserve and incorporate the doddfrank act capital actions as opposed to the companys planned capital actions which are intended to normalize capital distributions across large united states bank holding companies the federal reserve conducts ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests employing stress scenarios and internal supervisory models the federal reserves ccar and doddfrank act supervisory stress tests incorporate the companys planned capital actions and the doddfrank act capital actions respectively the federal reserve and the company are currently required to publish the results of the annual supervisory and biennial companyrun stress tests respectively no later than june of each applicable year under the tailoring rules the company is no longer required to conduct midcycle stress tests and the federal reserve has eliminated the adverse scenario as a mandatory scenario in october the occ adopted a final rule that aligned the stress testing requirements for national banks with requirements for their holding companies under the tailoring rules under the occs rule national banks with assets in excess of billion including us bank national association are required to submit companyrun stress test results to the occ concurrently with their parent bank holding companys ccar submission to the federal reserve accordingly us bank national association began submitting companyrun stress tests on a biennial basis starting with its submission the stress test is based on the occs stress scenarios which are typically the same as the federal reserves stress scenarios and which will no longer include adverse stress scenarios and capital actions that are appropriate for the economic conditions assumed in each scenario basel iii liquidity requirements bank holding companies and their domestic bank subsidiaries subject to category i ii or iii standards under the tailoring rules are subject to a minimum liquidity coverage ratio lcr the lcr is designed to ensure that bank holding companies have sufficient highquality liquid assets to survive a significant liquidity stress event lasting for calendar days in october the federal banking regulators finalized a rule to implement the net stable funding ratio nsfr the nsfr is designed to promote stable longerterm funding of assets and business activities over a oneyear time horizon and applies to the company and us bank national association the final rule is generally similar to the may proposal with modifications to incorporate the changes made in the tailoring rules and align funding requirements for certain nonderivative assets and shortterm lending transactions to better reflect their risks and role in supporting the stability of certain funding markets under the tailoring rules and final nsfr rule the company and us bank national association as category iii banking organizations with less than billion of weighted shortterm wholesale funding qualify for reduced lcr and nsfr requirements calibrated at percent of the full requirements brokered deposits the federal deposit insurance corporation improvement act of the fdicia and fdic regulations limit the ability of an insured depository institution such as us bank national association to accept renew or roll over brokered deposits unless the institution is wellcapitalized under the prompt corrective action framework described below or unless it is adequately capitalized and obtains a waiver from the fdic in addition less than wellcapitalized banks are subject to restrictions on the interest rates they may pay on deposits in december the fdic issued a final rule that is designed to encourage innovation in how banks offer services and products to customers by reducing obstacles to certain types of partnerships and that is expected to reduce the amount of deposits that would be classified as brokered full compliance with the final rule is required as of january us bank national association is reviewing its deposits in light of the final rule the ultimate impact of the final rule on us bank national association may be limited because the liquidity rules treatment of certain deposits remains unchanged even if such deposits would no longer be deemed to be brokered deposits under the fdics final rule prompt corrective action the fdicia provides a framework for regulation of depository institutions and their affiliates including parent holding companies by federal banking regulators as part of that framework the fdicia requires the relevant federal banking regulator to take prompt corrective action with respect to an fdicinsured depository institution such as us bank national association if that institution does not meet certain capital adequacy standards supervisory actions by the appropriate federal banking regulator under the prompt corrective action rules generally depend upon an institutions classification within five capital categories an institution that fails to remain wellcapitalized becomes subject to a series of restrictions that increase in severity as its capital condition weakens such restrictions may include a prohibition on capital distributions restrictions on asset growth or restrictions on the ability to receive regulatory approval of applications the fdicia also provides for enhanced supervisory authority over undercapitalized institutions including authority for the appointment of a conservator or receiver for the institution the regulations apply only to banks and not to bank holding companies such as the company however the federal reserve is authorized to take appropriate action at the holding company level based on the undercapitalized status of the holding companys subsidiary banking institutions in certain instances relating to an undercapitalized banking institution the bank holding company would be required to guarantee the performance of the undercapitalized subsidiarys capital restoration plan and could be liable for civil money damages for failure to fulfill those guarantee commitments singlecounterparty
