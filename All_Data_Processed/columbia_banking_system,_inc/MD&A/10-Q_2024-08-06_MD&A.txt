applicable prior periods financial performance comparison of current quarter to prior quarter earnings per diluted common share was for the three months ended june as compared to for the three months ended march the decrease for the three months ended june as compared to the prior period was primarily driven by a million increase in the provision for credit losses as well as a decrease in noninterest income driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity this unfavorable change was partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense largely due to a decrease in salaries and benefits as well as decreases in the majority of the noninterest expense categories as a result of ongoing strategic actions taken to reduce our noninterest expense run rate net interest income increased due to higher income earned on loans and investment securities including accretion income and lower borrowing costs offset partially by increased deposit expense net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended june as compared to for the three months ended march the increase for the three months ended june was driven by higher yields on loans and investment securities including the benefit of accretion income which offset a modest increase in the cost of interestbearing deposits noninterest income was million for the three months ended june as compared to million for the three months ended march the decline was driven by fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of million in the second quarter compared to a net fair value loss of million in the first quarter noninterest expense was million for the three months ended june as compared to million for the three months ended march the decrease is mainly due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits largely driven by a million reversal of a compensationrelated accrual as well as decreases in

by restructuring expenses comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period earnings per diluted common share was for the six months ended june as compared to for the six months ended june the increase for the six months ended june as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses due to the initial provision for historical columbia

six months ended june as compared to for the six months ended june the decrease for the six months ended june compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix net interest income decreased to million for the six months ended june compared to million for the six months ended june due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets and higher average balances due to the merger noninterest income was million for the six months ended june as compared to million for the six months ended june the change was fairly flat but included increases in most categories largely due to the impact of six months as a combined company compared to only four months as a combined company for the prior year period these increases were partially offset by fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity which collectively resulted in a net fair value loss of million for the six months ended june compared to a net fair value loss of million for the six months ended june table of contents noninterest expense was million for the six months ended june

amortization of intangible assets added in connection with the merger the expense impact of the six months as a combined company for the six months ended june compared to only four months as a combined company for the prior year period was largely offset by mergerrelated cost savings realized throughout comparison of current period end to prior year end total loans and leases were billion as of june an increase of million as compared to december the increase in total loans and leases was primarily in the commercial real estate and commercial loan balances and was driven by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the period total deposits were billion as of june a decrease of million as compared to december the decrease was driven by customer deposits due in part to seasonally anticipated customer tax payments offset by targeted deposit campaigns run by our branch network total consolidated assets were billion as of june compared to billion as of

losses of million for the three months ended march and million for the six months ended june the increase for the three months ended june compared to the prior quarter was mainly due to reserve release during the three months ended march associated with the recalibration of our cecl calculation the six months ended june included an million initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd

critical accounting estimates are described in detail in the critical accounting estimates section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december filed with the sec on february the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported management believes that the estimates for acl business combinations and goodwill are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and require difficult subjective or complex judgments there have been no material changes in the methodology of these estimates during the six months ended june results of operations columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february the merger date reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis accordingly columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect only uhc financial results through the closing of the merger as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the six months ended june may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had net income of million for the three months ended june compared to net income of million for the three months ended march the decrease in net income is mainly attributable to an increase in provision for credit losses and a decrease in noninterest income partially offset by a decrease in noninterest expense and an increase in net interest income the increase of million in provision for credit losses reflects the recalibration of our cecl calculation that took place during the three months ended march providing a benefit to the first quarter of 2024s provision for credit losses as well as credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models the decrease of million in noninterest income was primarily driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity the increase of million in net interest income reflects higher income earned on loans and investment securities including accretion income and lower borrowing costs the decrease of million in noninterest expense is mainly due to a decrease in salaries and employee benefits largely driven by a reversal of a compensationrelated accrual as well as decreases in the majority of the noninterest expense categories as a result of recent expense reduction initiatives this favorable change was partially offset by an increase in merger and restructuring expense which included million in restructuring expenses during the three months ended june the company conducted an enterprisewide evaluation of our operations during the first quarter of which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures with changes expected to be carried out through the third quarter of to achieve a core expense run rate for the fourth quarter of of million to million annualized as of june of identified cost savings have been realized the expected core expense run rate excludes cdi amortization merger and restructuring expense exit and disposal costs and the fdic special assessment comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the six months ended june the company had net income of million compared to net income of million for the same period in the prior year the increase in net income is mainly attributable to decreases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses partially offset by a decrease in net interest income the million decrease in noninterest expense is primarily due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses as the bulk of the merger expenses associated with the merger were recognized in the decrease of million in provision for credit losses was impacted by the initial provision of million for historical columbia nonpcd loans that was recorded in the first quarter of the decrease of million in net interest income was due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the six months ended june table of contents the following table presents the return on average assets gaap average common shareholders equity gaap and average tangible common shareholders equity nongaap for the periods indicated for each period presented the table includes the calculated ratios based on reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity this measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization return on average tangible common shareholders equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a nongaap financial

additionally management believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by

are not required to be uniformly applied and are not reviewed or audited although we believe these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap net interest income comparison of current quarter to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended june was million an increase of million compared to the three months ended march the increase was driven by an million increase in interest income largely driven by higher income earned on loans and investment securities including accretion income and lower borrowing costs this was partially offset by million in higher deposit costs targeted pricing actions limited the increase in columbias cost of interestbearing deposits between periods the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended june as compared to for the three months ended march the expansion was driven by higher yields on loans and investment securities including the benefit of accretion income which offset a modest increase in the cost of interestbearing deposits the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended june increased by basis points compared to the three months ended march the cost of interestbearing liabilities for the three months ended june increased by basis points compared to the three months ended march due to rising cost of funds on deposits and product mix shift to higher cost money market and time deposits this was partially offset by a lower cost for borrowings as the company was able to utilize the more favorable rates associated with the frb btfp for the full quarter ended june comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period net interest income for the six months ended june was million a decrease of million compared to the six months ended june the decrease is due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the six months ended june compared to the prior year period as a result of the merger table of contents the net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the six months ended june as compared to for the six months ended june the decrease for the six months ended june compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix the yield on loans and leases for the six months ended june increased by basis points as compared to the same period in primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities increased by basis points for the six months ended june as compared to the same period in due to a higher mix of highercost time deposits as well as rising interest rates our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in the yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds between march and july the federal reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by during that period our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the federal reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing since the federal reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate we have experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaces the increase in our earning asset yields as our deposits have continued to reprice higher and our funding base has experienced a shift toward highercost sources as federal reserve actions have reduced available liquidity within the banking industry as a result our net interest margin has contracted since july due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets further the impact of balance sheet composition changes and the higher interest rate environment has shifted the interest rate sensitivity position of the balance sheet to a liability sensitive position as of june from an asset sensitive position at the onset of the rising rate environment table of contents the following table presents condensed average balance sheet information

the three months ended march as an annualized percentage of average outstanding loans and leases the provision for credit losses recorded for the three months ended june was as compared to for the

commercial credit typically loans in a nonaccrual status will not have an allowance for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or chargedoff however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the cecl model and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on nonaccrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become days past due at which time they are chargedoff the nonaccrual leases and equipment finance agreements of million as of june have a related allowance for credit losses of million with the remaining loans writtendown to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell and are expected to be resolved

classifications within earning assets representing and respectively of average earning assets for both the three month periods ended june and december the increase in commercial real estate and commercial loan balances between june and december was driven by commercial line utilization and construction project activity in the period higher commercial real estate term balances reflect projects that transitioned from construction to permanent financing delinquency and nonaccrual loan movements during the quarter reflect an anticipated move toward a normalized credit environment following a phase of exceptional high credit quality the increase in nonperforming assets during the quarter was driven by the expiration of certain covidrelated designations within the residential mortgage portfolio as nonperforming loans in commercial portfolios declined nonperforming loans during the quarter include million in government guarantees on the commercial real estate commercial and residential portfolios commercial real estate loans the commercial real estate portfolio includes loans to developers and institutional sponsors supporting incomeproducing or forsale commercial real

secured by multifamily properties including construction represent approximately of the total loan portfolio as of june and as of december these assets continue to perform well due to demand for

material increases in interest rates changes in tax and rent control policies tightening credit or refinancing markets or a decline in real estate values in the banks primary geographic footprint in

refer to note allowance for credit losses for further information on key components of the forecast the models for calculating the acl are sensitive to changes to economic variables which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time we believe that the acl as of june is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as

beginning of period additions for new msr capitalized changes in fair value changes due to collectionrealization of expected cash flows over time changes due to valuation inputs or assumptions balance

percentage of serviced loans residential msr are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of income the value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive prepayments increase and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline historically the fair value of our residential msr will increase as market rates for mortgage loans rise and decrease if market rates fall goodwill and other intangible assets as of june and december the company had billion in goodwill which was recorded as a result of the merger goodwill is recorded in connection with business combinations and represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the net assets acquired as of june we had other intangible assets of million as compared to million at december as part of a business acquisition the fair value of identifiable intangible assets such as core deposits which includes all deposits except certificates of deposit was recognized at the merger date intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives the core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of years using the sumoftheyearsdigits method intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment no impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented table of contents deposits total deposits were billion as of june a decrease of million as compared to december the decrease was driven by customer deposits due in part to anticipated seasonal customer tax payments partially offset by targeted campaigns run by our branch network the interestbearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from noninterestbearing to interestbearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment the following table presents the deposit balances by category as of the dates presented june december  in thousands amount amount noninterestbearing demand

management fhlb advances have fixed rates ranging from to all of which are set to mature before the end of the first quarter of advances from the fhlb are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate the frb borrowings have interest rates ranging from to and mature in january although the company has the ability to repay balances prior to maturity without penalty the frb borrowings are secured by investment securities junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million as of june and december respectively the decrease is mainly due to a decline of million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value the change in fair value was driven by increases in credit spreads and comparable swap rates during the period as of june substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth term sofr table of contents liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity to support balance sheet flexibility fund growth in lending and investment portfolios and deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources we monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented of total deposits at june and december the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank the banks diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the banks reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion as of june compared with billion at december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase issue brokered certificates of deposit or utilize offbalance sheet funding sources the bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of offbalance sheet funding sources these liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit advances from the fhlb and the federal reserve banks discount window availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds balances available for loan and continued

pay dividends to the company fdic and oregon division of financial regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the bank to the company although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels commitments and other contractual obligations the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as of june time deposits totaled billion of which billion mature in a year or less total
