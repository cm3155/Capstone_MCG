comparison of current quarter to prior quarter earnings per diluted common share was for the three months ended september as compared to for the three months ended june the increase for the three

favorable change in noninterest expense due to the prior quarter including million in restructuring expenses net interest income increased due to higher income earned on loans net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended september unchanged from the three months ended june a favorable balance sheet funding mix shift into lowercost deposits and a slight increase in loan yields offset a lower yield on securities contributing to margin stability between periods noninterest income was million for the three months ended september as compared to million for the three

third quarter compared to a net fair value loss of million in the second quarter noninterest expense was million for the three months ended september as compared to million for the three months ended june the decrease is mainly due to a decrease in restructuring expenses partially offset by an increase in salaries and employee benefits as prior quarters expense was reduced by a million reversal of a compensationrelated accrual due to staff reductions that took place in the second quarter salaries and wages were down by million in the third quarter related to the enterprisewide evaluation of our operations which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures which partially offset the impact of the second quarters accrual reversal that did not repeat in the current quarter comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period earnings per diluted common share was for the nine months ended september as compared to for the nine months ended september the increase for the nine months ended september as compared to the prior year period was primarily driven by a decrease in the provision for credit losses due to the initial provision for historical columbia nonpcd loans that was recorded in the first quarter of noninterest expense also decreased primarily due to lower expenses related to the merger these favorable changes were partially offset by a decrease in net interest income due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets net interest margin on a taxequivalent basis was for the nine months ended september as compared to for the nine months ended september the decrease for the nine months ended september compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix net interest income decreased million for the nine months ended september compared to the nine months ended september due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets and higher average balances due to the merger noninterest income was million for the nine months ended september as compared to million for the nine months ended september the increase was partially due to fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity which collectively resulted in a favorable change due to a net fair value loss of million for the nine months ended september compared to a net fair value loss of million for the nine months ended

described in detail in the critical accounting estimates section of our annual report on form 10k for the year ended december filed with the sec on february the condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with gaap and follow general practices within the financial services industry in which the company operates this preparation requires management to make estimates assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes these estimates assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements accordingly as this information changes actual results could differ from the estimates assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements certain estimates inherently have a greater reliance on the use of assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported management believes that the estimates for acl business combinations and goodwill are important to the portrayal of the companys financial condition and results of operations and require difficult subjective or complex judgments there have been no material changes in the methodology of these estimates during the nine months ended september results of operations columbias financial results for any periods ended prior to february the merger date reflect uhc results only on a standalone basis accordingly columbias reported financial results for the first quarter of reflect only uhc financial results through the closing of the merger as a result of these two factors columbias financial results for the nine months ended september may not be directly comparable to prior or future reported periods comparison of current quarter to prior quarter the company had net income of million for the three months ended september compared to net income of million for the three months ended june the increase in net income was mainly attributable to increases in noninterest income and net interest income as well as decreases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses partially offset by an increase in provision for income taxes the increase of million in noninterest income was primarily driven by quarterly fluctuations in fair value adjustments and msr hedging activity driven by changes in interest rates the increase of million in net interest income reflects higher income earned on loans which occurred despite a reduction in purchase accounting accretion income and relatively stable funding costs prior to the latequarter decline in the federal funds rate the decrease of million in noninterest expense was mainly due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expense driven by million in restructuring expenses during the three months ended june the restructuring expense was due to an enterprisewide evaluation of our operations during the first quarter of which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures with changes carried out primarily in the second quarter the decrease of million in provision for credit losses reflects credit migration trends and changes in the economic forecasts used in credit models comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period for the nine months ended september the company had net income of million compared to net income of million for the same period in the prior year the increase in net income was mainly attributable to decreases in noninterest expense and provision for credit losses partially offset by a decrease in net interest income the million decrease in noninterest expense was primarily due to a decrease in merger and restructuring expenses as the bulk of the merger expenses associated with the merger were recognized in the decrease of million in provision for credit losses was impacted by the initial provision of million for historical columbia nonpcd loans that was recorded in the first quarter of the decrease of million in net interest income was due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the nine months ended september the company paid off million in btfp borrowings during the third quarter to continue to rebalance our funding sources in support of our liquidity management program and lower the cost of liabilities during the first quarter of the company conducted an enterprisewide evaluation of our operations which resulted in consolidated positions and simplified reporting and organizational structures as of september the company realized million in annualized cost savings or

reported net income to the extent return on average common shareholders equity is used to compare our performance with other financial institutions that do not have merger and acquisitionrelated intangible assets we believe it is beneficial to also consider the return on average tangible common shareholders equity this measure is useful for evaluating the performance of a business as it calculates the return available to common shareholders without the impact of intangible assets and their related amortization return on average tangible common shareholders equity is also used as part of our incentive compensation program for our executive officers the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is calculated by dividing net income by average shareholders common equity less average goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the return on average tangible common shareholders equity is considered a nongaap financial measure and should be viewed in

believes tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are meaningful measures of capital adequacy columbia believes the exclusion of certain intangible assets in the computation of tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio provides a meaningful base for periodtoperiod and companytocompany comparisons which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results and capital of the company tangible common equity is calculated as total shareholders equity less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr in addition tangible assets are total assets less goodwill and other intangible assets net excluding msr the tangible common equity ratio is calculated as tangible common shareholders equity divided by tangible assets tangible common equity and the tangible common equity ratio are considered nongaap financial measures and should be viewed in conjunction with total shareholders equity and the total shareholders

required to be uniformly applied and are not reviewed or audited although we believe these nongaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company they have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap net interest income comparison of current quarter to prior quarter net interest income for the three months ended september was million an increase of million compared to the three months ended june the increase was driven by a million increase in interest income largely driven by higher income earned on loans due to higher average rates which occurred despite a reduction in accretion income and relatively stable funding costs prior to the reduction in the federal funds rate that occurred in the latter part of september the net interest margin net interest income as a percentage of average interestearning assets on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the three months ended september unchanged from the three months ended june a favorable balance sheet funding mix shift into lowercost deposits and a slight increase in loan yields offset lower yields on securities and contributed to margin stability between periods the yield on loans and leases for the three months ended september was an increase of basis points compared to the three months ended june the cost of interestbearing liabilities for the three months ended september was a decrease of basis points compared to the three months ended june anticipated seasonal deposit inflows and focused campaigns run by our branch network contributed to customer balance growth during the third quarter comparison of current yeartodate to prior year period net interest income for the nine months ended september was billion a decrease of million compared to the nine months ended september the decrease was due to higher rates on interestbearing liabilities partially offset by higher average yields on interestearning assets and a larger average balance sheet for the nine months ended september compared to the prior year period as a result of the merger the net interest margin on a fully taxequivalent basis was for the nine months ended september as compared to for the nine months ended september the decrease for the nine months ended september compared to the prior year period was due to higher funding costs that reflect deposit repricing and a shift in product mix the yield on loans and leases for the nine months ended september and september was and respectively an increase of basis points primarily attributable to the rising interest rate environment and purchase accounting accretion and amortization related to the merger the cost of interestbearing liabilities was for the nine months ended september compared to for the nine months ended september an increase of basis points due to a higher mix of highercost time deposits and term borrowing balances as well as rising interest rates our net interest income is affected by changes in the amount and mix of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities as well as changes in the yields earned on interestearning assets and rates paid on deposits and borrowed funds the federal reserve lowered the target range for the federal funds rate by in september and is expected to continue rate cuts into and however between march and july the federal reserve raised the target range for the federal funds rate by during that period our net interest margin expanded as our asset sensitive balance sheet became increasingly profitable due to active rate increases by the federal reserve and the lagged impact to deposit pricing after the federal reserve ceased increasing the federal funds rate we experienced an increase in our funding costs that outpaced the increase in our earning asset yields as our deposits continued to reprice higher and our funding base experienced a shift toward highercost sources as federal reserve actions reduced available liquidity within the banking industry as a result our net interest margin contracted during the latter half of due to the impact of higher funding costs and minimal change to the average yield on earning assets our net interest margin began to stabilize in the to range beginning in february following a comprehensive review related to how we evaluate and approve deposit pricing further the impact of balance sheet composition changes and the higher interest rate environment shifted the interest rate sensitivity position of the balance sheet to a liability sensitive position as of september from an asset sensitive position at the onset of the rising rate environment the following tables present condensed average balance

for credit loss as they will be written down to their net realizable value or chargedoff however the net realizable value for homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements are determined by the loss given default calculated by the cecl model and therefore homogeneous leases and equipment finance agreements on nonaccrual will have an allowance for credit loss amount until they become days past due at which time they are chargedoff the nonaccrual leases and equipment finance agreements of million as of september have a related allowance for credit losses of million with the remaining loans writtendown to the estimated fair value of the collateral less estimated costs to sell and are expected to be resolved with no additional material loss absent further decline in market prices

note allowance for credit losses for further information the models for calculating the acl are sensitive to changes to economic variables which could result in volatility as these assumptions change over time we believe that the acl as of september is sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio and in credit commitments outstanding as of that date based on the information

loans residential msr are adjusted to fair value quarterly with the change recorded in residential mortgage banking revenue on the condensed consolidated statements of income the value of servicing rights can fluctuate based on changes in interest rates and other factors generally as interest rates decline and borrowers are able to take advantage of a refinance incentive prepayments increase and the total value of existing servicing rights declines as expectations of future servicing fee collections decline historically the fair value of our residential msr will increase as market rates for

was recognized at the merger date intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized to their estimated residual values over their respective estimated useful lives the core deposit intangible assets recorded are amortized on an accelerated basis over a period of years using the sumoftheyearsdigits method intangible assets are evaluated for impairment if events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment no impairment losses have been recognized in the periods presented deposits total deposits were billion as of september a decrease of million as compared to december the decrease was due to a reduction in brokered deposits partially offset by customer deposit growth largely in commercial customer balances driven by focused campaigns run by our branch network the interestbearing deposit mix increased mainly due to a migration from noninterestbearing to interestbearing accounts as customers seek higher rates in the current interest rate environment the

ranging from to all of which are set to mature before the end of the first quarter of advances from the fhlb are secured by investment securities and loans secured by real estate the frb borrowings have interest rates ranging from to and mature in january although the company has the ability to repay balances prior to maturity without penalty the frb borrowings are secured by investment securities junior and other subordinated debentures we had junior and other subordinated debentures with carrying values of million and million as of september and december respectively the decrease is mainly due to a decline of million in fair value for the junior subordinated debentures elected to be carried at fair value the change in fair value was driven by increases in credit spreads and modest changes in swap rates during the nine months ended september as of september substantially all of the junior subordinated debentures had interest rates that are adjustable on a quarterly basis based on a spread over threemonth term sofr liquidity and cash flow the principal objective of our liquidity management program is to maintain the banks ability to meet the daytoday cash flow requirements of our customers who either wish to withdraw funds or to draw upon credit facilities to meet their cash needs the banks liquidity strategy includes maintaining sufficient onbalance sheet liquidity to support balance sheet flexibility fund growth in lending and investment portfolios and deleverage nondeposit liabilities as economic conditions permit as a result the company believes that it has sufficient cash and access to borrowings to effectively manage through the current economic conditions as well as meet its working capital and other needs the company will continue to prudently evaluate and maintain liquidity sources including the ability to fund future loan growth and manage our borrowing sources we monitor the sources and uses of funds daily to maintain an acceptable liquidity position one source of funds includes public deposits individual state laws require banks to collateralize public deposits typically as a percentage of their public deposit balance in excess of fdic insurance public deposits represented of total deposits at both september and december the amount of collateral required varies by state and may also vary by institution within each state depending on the individual states risk assessment of depository institutions changes in the pledging requirements for uninsured public deposits may require pledging additional collateral to secure these deposits drawing on other sources of funds to finance the purchase of assets that would be available to be pledged to satisfy a pledging requirement or could lead to the withdrawal of certain public deposits from the bank the banks diversified deposit base provides a sizeable source of relatively stable and lowcost funding while reducing the banks reliance on the wholesale markets total deposits were billion as of september compared with billion at december the bank also has liquidity from excess bond collateral of billion in addition to liquidity from core deposits and the repayments and maturities of loans and investment securities the bank can sell securities under agreements to repurchase issue brokered certificates of deposit or utilize offbalance sheet funding sources the bank maintains a substantial level of total available liquidity in the form of offbalance sheet funding sources these liquidity sources include capacity to borrow from uncommitted lines of credit advances from the fhlb and the federal reserve banks discount window availability of the uncommitted lines of credit is subject to federal funds balances available for loan

the ability of the bank to pay dividends to the company fdic and oregon division of financial regulation approval is required for quarterly dividends from the bank to the company although we expect the banks and the companys liquidity positions to remain satisfactory during it is possible that our deposit balances may not be maintained at previous levels due to pricing pressure or customers behavior in the current economic environment in addition in order to generate deposit growth our pricing may need to be adjusted in a manner that results in increased interest expense on deposits we may utilize borrowings or other funding sources which are generally more costly than deposit funding to support our liquidity levels commitments and other contractual obligations the company participates in many different contractual arrangements which may or may not be recorded on its balance sheet under which the company has an obligation to pay certain amounts provide credit or liquidity enhancements or provide market risk support our material contractual obligations are primarily for time deposits and borrowings as of september time deposits totaled billion of which billion
