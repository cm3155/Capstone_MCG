collection of cash and previous credit losses recognized in earnings when the fair value of an available for sale debt security falls below the amortized cost basis it is evaluated to determine if any of the decline in value is attributable to credit loss decreases in fair value attributable to credit loss would be recorded directly to earnings with a corresponding allowance for credit losses limited by the amount that the fair value is less than the amortized cost basis if the credit quality subsequently improves the allowance would be reversed up to a maximum of the previously recorded credit losses if the company intends to sell an impaired available for sale debt security or if it is more likely than not that the company will be required to sell the security prior to recovering the amortized cost basis the entire fair value adjustment would be immediately recognized in earnings with no corresponding allowance for credit losses at september the market value of debt securities available for sale had a net unrealized gain of million compared to a net unrealized gain of million at december the change in valuation was the result of fluctuations in market interest rates during the nine months ended september in addition to there being less securities classified as available for sale at september than december as a result of the aforementioned transfer to the held to

the form of loans or other credit substitutes to individuals and businesses is one of our principal business activities our policies as well as applicable laws and regulations require risk analysis as well as ongoing portfolio and credit management we manage our credit risk through lending limit constraints credit review approval policies and extensive ongoing internal monitoring we also manage credit risk through diversification of the loan portfolio by type of loan type of industry and type of borrower and by limiting the aggregation of debt to a single borrower in analyzing our existing portfolio we review our consumer and residential loan portfolios by their performance as a pool of loans since no single loan is individually significant or judged by its risk rating size or potential risk of loss in contrast the monitoring process for the commercial business real estate construction and commercial real estate portfolios includes periodic reviews of individual loans with risk ratings assigned to each loan and performance judged on a loanbyloan basis table of contents we review these loans to assess the ability of our borrowers to service all interest and principal obligations and as a result the risk rating may be adjusted accordingly in the event that full collection of principal and interest is not reasonably assured the loan is appropriately downgraded and if warranted placed on nonaccrual status even though the loan may be current as to principal and interest payments additionally we assess whether an individually measured allowance is required for collateral dependent nonaccrual loans with balances equal to or greater than and with respect to which foreclosure is probable for the individually measured collateral dependent nonaccrual loan the allowance for credit losses is equal to the difference between amortized cost of the loan and the determined value of the collateral however if the determined value of the collateral is greater than the amortized cost of the loan no allowance for credit losses will be added for these loans for additional discussion on our methodology in managing credit risk within our loan portfolio see the
