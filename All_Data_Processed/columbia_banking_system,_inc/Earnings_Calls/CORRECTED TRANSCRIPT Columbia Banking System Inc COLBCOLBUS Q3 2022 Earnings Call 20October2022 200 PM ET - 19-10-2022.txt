the prior high set just last quarter meaningful increase in top line revenue was supported by robust loan growth a stable deposit base and an expanding margin during the last rate cycle the structural advantages of our deposit base coupled with our wealth management capabilities allowed us to significantly outperform industry deposit betas at this point in the current cycle we were seeing favorable results teams throughout the company have remained focused on meeting the needs of our customers and continuing to scale our existing operations while at the same time working with their umpqua

call 20oct2022 relationships we believe the combined company will best be positioned to respond and scale the future market share growth opportunities preparation for our combination with umpqua holdings continues to progress as both companies eagerly await regulatory approval on the call with me today are aaron deer chris merrywell and andy mcdonald following our prepared remarks well open the line for questions for handing the call over to aaron i need to remind you that we may make forwardlooking statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release website or our sec filings aaron aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you clint and good morning everyone pretax preprovision income was million rose by million on a linked quarter basis and represents a new company record the increase was driven by a combination of rising net interest income and higher noninterest income total deposits ended the quarter at billion which was a slight decrease of million from the prior quarter but the overall mix improved with the higher level of noninterest bearing balances moreover much of the rate sensitive deposit outflows during the quarter reflected movement of funds to cb financial our total cost of deposits rose by basis points to basis points during the quarter caused largely by the routine repricing of municipal deposits total loans rose by million to billion this represents a annualized growth rate with balances propelled by million of new originations and a points increase in the line utilization rate total investment securities decreased million during the quarter to billion which was split available for sale and held to maturity the quarterly decrease was driven by scheduled maturities premium amortization and pay downs as well as the fair value mark on our afs portfolio the expected yield on the current portfolio is up basis point during the quarter our net interest margin increased basis points on a linked quarter basis to as we benefited from the repricing of existing floating and variable rate loans as well as strong production of new loans at rates above the portfolio average moreover our funding costs inched only slightly higher as we benefited from our stable low cost funding base with half of our deposits in noninterest bearing accounts new loans were brought on at an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which is up from in the second quarter and higher than the overall portfolio yield of we continue to be well positioned for additional rate hikes as the fed battles inflationary pressures noninterest income increased linked quarter by million to million of note this included a million gain related to the sale leaseback of a building acquired through the former acquisition this was offset by a decrease in loan revenue of million due to the cyclical decline in mortgage banking as well as lower prepayment fees on loans noninterest expense increased by million linked quarter to million adjusting for merger related expenses of million in the third quarter and million in the second quarter noninterest expense increased by million to million this increase was largely due to million of higher compensation expenses resulting mostly from higher incentive payouts a drop in capitalized loan origination costs from lower but still strong production and a return to normal 401k matching expense after a favorable true up of approximately in the second quarter data processing and software and occupancy expense increased due to project timing and loan expenses increased due to fluctuations in client reimbursement timing for the current quarter we project our expense run rate excluding merger costs to be in the mid the provision for income taxes increased million linked columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 quarter to million representing a effective rate we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the to range perhaps at the higher end of the range given our higher profitability lastly as we have previously discussed the rise in interest rates results in a negative fair value mark on our investment portfolio reflected through accumulated other comprehensive income while this mark does not affect our regulatory capital ratios it does weigh on our tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value excluding aoci however both our tce ratio and our tangible book value increased during the quarter and with that ill turn it over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron loan production was our best third quarter on record and our fourth best quarter overall im especially proud of what our bankers continue to achieve given an extremely competitive market for loans and competition remaining very aggressive on pricing and structure to achieving this level of growth while stepping away from loans that didnt adhere to our underwriting andor pricing disciplines speaks volumes about the quality of our bankers about of the growth in our loan portfolio was due to increasing line utilization primarily in the professional services and entertainment sectors within the remaining growth driven by robust production across multiple sectors but predominantly in real estate leasing healthcare and agriculture our pipelines continue to remain to our satisfaction the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable term loans represented million of the total new production while new lines accounted for million the overall portfolio mix is now fixed floating and variable overall the composition of the loan portfolio did not change materially during the quarter even with the increase in line utilization as a result of higher rates we continue to see a decline in our residential mortgage production with sold loans dropping from million linked quarter to million for the third quarter during the quarter we saw a marked increase in the transfer of deposits from columbia bank for cb financial services rising to million from million in the second quarter and as aaron mentioned bank deposit balances remained level declining by only million during the quarter the mix improved slightly and as of september deposits were evenly split noninterest bearing and interest bearing our overall composition remain consistent with commercial and retail we continue to expand and recently added an experienced team leader who is building out a loan production office in the phoenix market this is on the heels of our expansion into the salt lake city market and we are very pleased with its results as we continue to strategically invest in our retail network our newest financial hub opened during the quarter in the vibrant proctor district of tacoma financial hubs our full service locations that are uniquely focused on helping our clients achieve their comprehensive financial goals including investments trust services and other financial considerations i want to recognize the hard work and commitment of all of our bankers who continue to support each other and our clients as we await regulatory approval for the upcoming combination with umpqua they have done an excellent job anticipating and meeting the needs of our existing clients which i expect to continue once the merger is finalized now ill turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you chris with just in net chargeoffs during the quarter a million provision drove a million increase in the allowance the additional reserve was primarily driven by loan growth during the quarter and to a lesser extent a declining economic forecast we continue to see softening in the economic outlook evidenced by less favorable forecast for gdp unemployment and other key variables offsetting loan growth and the less than favorable economic forecast was a continuation in the trend of improving credit metrics npas to total assets and nonperforming loans to periodend loans fell to only basis points and basis points respectively there was very minor credit migration during the quarter with overall watch and problem loans falling from million or of total loans to million or of total loans as of september given these metrics we expect loan growth and the economic forecasts to continue to be the primary drivers of changes to our allowance in summary while we continue to see solid credit metrics we will continue to remain vigilant to supply chain impacts from the war in ukraine rising energy costs inflation and the impact of rising rates on the housing and domestic economy in general okay clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andy our regular quarterly dividend of was announced earlier this month and will be paid on october to shareholders of record as of 17th this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now tanya well open the call columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions our first question will come from jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co just a question about the expenses maybe for aaron as he kind of chased that down expenses this quarter higher than the mid guide wanted to see if theres any pull forward on costs that may help future run rates i know that youve talked to mid and youre sticking with that in  but were there upfront expenses that may offset going forward thanks aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc hey jeff i wouldnt call it upfront expenses per se but there are timing issues that influence from one quarter to the next so the mid guide is it still kind of holds and if you look at where weve been through the year and average that out were right in that range and expect it to stay so but the variability that you kind of see quarter toquarter can bounce around a lot remember last quarter we had there was that kind of benefit we had in our 401k true up there was also actually a medical accrual benefit that we had in the second quarter as well that was around and then we had a big swing in the capitalized loan expense between the two quarters and that was actually a variance of like million and then we also had about million true up in our for the incentive plans just given the strong yeartodate performance that weve had other items in the quarter that the data processing and software expenses up a fair bit there were a few things there a big part of that again was kind of timing on just certain expenses and when they hit during the course of the year we also just had some projects related to continued investments in the business and there were some higher contract pricing as some of the tech contracts that we have do have builtin inflation adjusters occupancy line was up a little bit that reflected just some timing of repairs that were getting done during the summer months and as chris noted we opened our new proctor financial hub and there were some expenses related to that otherwise the other line i think the increase there was largely some timing issues just related to certain fees that we pay on behalf of customers in terms of credit reports title insurance ucc filings that sort of thing and then when we collect those fees back from the clients indiscernible appraisal fees were higher in there and just some other onetime stuff as well so not so just really just timing nothing that was a recurring kind of thing that i would draw attention to columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay a lot of pieces there i guess trying to get a sense for what you have shared on a combination with umpqua on tangible book value and dilution obviously we can track individually the aoci pressure but updating those marks and getting to a comfortable level either you shared specific figures or some guideposts as to what you think pro forma tangible book could be thanks aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc we havent we of course are tracking that very closely and given a lot of thoughts what thats going to look like in terms of where the indiscernible but we havent given any guidance on that front and refrain to do so just given the significant volatility that weve had in the rate environment jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay clint i wanted to maybe shift gears i think through the course of the since the announcement youve expressed very limited i think you ph couched as sort of regrettable losses on a personnel basis as weve extended the close here just wanted to get an update on that front if youve seen any other departures that given the delay if thats impacting decisions or departures or anything on that side obviously weve tracked a couple hires but wanted to check in on the other side of that clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah no when i think about i think the pace or the number of departures in the third quarter were much lower than what we saw in the second quarter nothing that ill say from a customer facing perspective or direct support of our production capacities elevates to the threshold weve put in place of regrettable attrition or turnover there is an individual in our risk group who had the opportunity to become the cro somewhere else so id say that we wish that she was still part of our organization but thats pretty far removed from anything to do with production or anything its more administrative so not really anything thats jumping out at me ill let chris weigh in here in a second but what ill just leave you with is if you look at the activities that continue it was actually from an operational standpoint a fairly quiet i believe the term that we used on our last board call was benign quarter its all relative given that weve just managed the company through a global pandemic but when they look at the core operating performance of our company the third quarter we hit on everything that we would have hoped to have hit on at the start of the quarter had great loan growth i believe that when everybody reports youll see that were one of the better performers on our deposit data weve mentioned that part of our strategy in that regard one is just the strength of our deposit base but also our wealth management capabilities and thats a tremendous asset in terms of being able to minimize those costs and so theres nothing i guess the reason im rehashing all of that is that if we had any material regrettable turnover attrition we wouldnt be able to accomplish those things so our top performing bankers are still out there executing and taking care of the clients growing their books and then that energy and excitement is whats allowing us to attract the new talent thats coming in and throughout our existing footprint we continue to attract talent and then its also what weve done in our expansion into the utah market and then chris glossed over the team leader that weve hired in the phoenix market and will start building that out as well so ill step back and see if chris has anybody thats hit his radar that he would classify as regrettable columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks clint jeff the same i wouldnt classify anything as regrettable but to give you an idea of some of the movement that takes place we had an individual that was a team leader for our retail business banking group located here in the puget sound he had sold his house a year ago had expressed a strong desire to relocate out of the puget sound area we were working with him on that as an option and another bank picked him up and he relocated to spokane during the quarter now the team is intact the team is often producing and when you look at somebody relocating to a different part of the market i wouldnt put that into a regrettable standpoint good team leader but it wont affect our production going forward i can tell you that the teams that have joined us specifically in utah theyre hitting the ground running theyre often producing and thats a really good sign to hit the ground quickly on that aspect of it and the other piece id put out there and just reiterate clint and our top producers are staying with us and they see the vision i would tell you that the our competitors are theyre calling theyre very aggressive on opportunities in all of our markets and to date again nothing that i would classify as regrettable or is going to affect our ability to execute on our strategy jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thanks for the update operator thank you one moment moving forward our next question will come from david feaster of raymond james david your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc just kind of maybe following up on the transaction look i know this deal has taken longer than we all wanted it to but im just curious as you and umpqua continue to run down parallel paths both performing well extremely well independently could you talk about maybe how you all have already begun working together to maybe service some common clients or even servicing larger clients like weve talked about obviously weve already started to see some new hires from on both sides with new talent being attracted to the combined entity but just im thinking maybe are there any ways that the longer time to close has been beneficial and maybe could even make the integration smoother or is there anything like that that could come to fruition clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc david you packed a lot into that question columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc indiscernible clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thats its been a few months since youve seen me but my hair continues to get whiter and i think part of that is the challenge that we have is were still running two separate companies and we have to go out and compete as odd as it sounds compete against each other within the marketplace as two separate companies but then we have kind of a firewall in between with the folks that are working on the integration so theres things that we cant do the first part of the question relative to collaborating on large clients or really any clients and so that is a little bit of awkwardness that weve been placed in for the past year but what we can do is we can plan for the integration and weve decoupled things that are specific to the systems conversions product planning for the combined company all of those things from legal day one so were still able to make progress on that and thats why at this point we still believe that the systems conversion pending receipt of it i think all were waiting on at this point now is the federal reserve and the fdic the state of oregon has given their approval and then we announced our letter of agreement with the department of justice so assuming that those other two regulatory approvals come in in the near future were on track for that first quarter core systems conversion where the time the extra time has been beneficial a year ago at this time there was a lot of question from people about our cultural compatibility and weve spent a lot of time in investor meetings talking about the similarities of our cultures in our companies and weve put little over leaders between the two companies through a full day culture launch session we wouldnt have been able to do that if we had closed on a more traditional sixmonth timeline so we had time to clearly identify the combined culture develop the culture activation content ill get points for using those terms from chief marketing officer and we actually have schedule starting next month where well put associates across both companies through a condensed version of that and so i think those things help accelerate the social integration the systems integration is tracking just fine along our original timeline but the delay in the close has enabled us to get the social cultural elements i think more defined and in front of folks so i think thats going to be a huge benefit as we do get to the close and i think thats why the momentum each companys maintained independently is important and i think that will carry over and that momentum will continue if not accelerate as we come together as one company david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great thank you for that and then just looking at originations originations were really strong in the quarter i think a testament to what you were talking about and retain your key personnel im just curious what youre seeing on the demand front has higher rates started to impact the pulse of your clients are you starting to see any shift in demand just given the challenging economic backdrop just curious what youre seeing on that front christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 yeah david its certainly all things considered in that i think the biggest issue is from a pricing standpoint i wouldnt say thats a truly affected demand outside ph of for us our mortgage team which has never been a huge source and its very important to what we do but thats very interest rate sensitive theres still transactions that are going on theres plenty of ci theres plenty of cre as well and as i mentioned were trying to hold the discipline to pricing and then certainly ive always followed our discipline with andy at the helm of our conservative underwriting and being prudent on that knowing that yeah the environment could change dramatically on us and i think were in a good position there that keeps us out of some deals by not being a max proceeds lender and things of that nature and just being very selective on the types of deals that were doing and really trying to target complete relationships and working on that aspect of it i think demand in general is pulling back i wouldnt expect numbers to be continue to be put up that up like this in records quarter after quarter but the teams are finding their way into prospects our clients are still actively doing things but overall yeah i would expect it to pull back some david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay that makes sense and then just maybe touching on deposits it was great to see noninterest bearing growth in the quarter i was hoping you could just give us a little color on that and then maybe just touching on the other side the outflows that you saw outside of that it sounds like it was mostly moving more rate sensitive clients into the trust in the wealth management side or are you starting to see more clients work through cash balances just curious what youre seeing on the that side and expectations for flows near term christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc so david if i understand that sounds like kind of two different things there the outflows to cb financial are really a byproduct of finding out what the client is really looking for are they is it truly a rate sensitive bank deposit or are they looking to increase their yield and they truly have excess funds that they can deploy outside of the bank its no secret that theres more attractive returns in treasuries than there are in bank deposits and so weve seen a healthy move into kind of liquidity type portfolios were still seeing people that are moving money and investing most of that is truly for liquidity purposes of the number that i mentioned beyond that we still have our process where were talking to our clients some of them are walking in with specials from ph cd specials from banks down the street they might have with us and we ultimately find out and these dont go into those numbers but then we find out theyve got an investment account somewhere and nobodys talked to them in a long period of time and we get to make those referrals as well that helps to attract outside money into the bank deposits as well so its really honestly its really full service in getting to know the client what theyre really looking for and then probably even more importantly finding out where all of their other deposits and money are housed and really surrounding that relationship and we see that moving we also continue to bring in some new relationships its not as not at the same pace and level that were accustomed to historically but were still winning new relationships and i think thats really important and a sign to how not only our bankers but our clients are seeing the opportunities of the pending combination and the products and services and the complete set that well have going forward and theyre making those moves now and i dont know if aaron wants to add anything in there or not columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think you captured it david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks everybody operator thank you christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks david operator one moment and our next question will come from matthew clark of piper sandler matthew your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co thanks hey everyone just want to close the loop on the merger discussion can you just remind us conversion process whos moving to what on the commercial side and it sounds like attrition has slowed here which is great news but can you just give us a sense for how youre going to try to defend and then limit attrition with that commercial conversion process clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah so the core system is were going with umpquas fis platform and weve talked with our existing core platform at columbia has been benchmarked to about the size of what the combined company would be so didnt really want to test new grounds with that system because our intent is that were going to continue to on a combined basis have opportunities to take market share and grow and especially in some of the de novo markets that both companies have established a presence in in the past year and so then back to how that makes some of the other decisions neither bank sometimes in larger deals its one bank is forced to do something because they fell behind in an area maybe in tech or something they ph couldnt make the investments and catch up that wasnt the case or isnt the case here so really it came down to well how do we limit execution risk and so knowing that were going to go with the umpqua core thats in place today well their business online banking platform is already piped in to that system so were able to reduce the risk of if we were to pipe in a new system or columbia system and its a very good platform there are some capabilities that our bankers are really really excited about with that and so then how do we limit the i guess the risk of that part of it is the experience we have a very experienced team from both organizations that have tried and ph trued process that theyre applying to and past learnings with other integrations and conversions and so thats an important aspect of it just planning more planning and thats i guess a followup to my response to davids question about the protracted approval timeline has allowed for additional planning and scheduling of mock conversions and things columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 and then theres some other things that we can do as we bring on new business i know our competitors would probably love for me to open the playbook up and tell them what that is but its just a comprehensive approach to making sure that the clients are taken care of communication is open and theyre supported throughout the entire process if theyre moving from one system to another on the consumer side its much easier were on the same platform we both use ph  for that theres some functionality things that have to be mapped out and integrated but other than that its the same platform i can see aarons itching since hes assigned directly to the integration management office to weigh in here so im going to step back and see if theres anything you want to clean up on what i said aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no i think you captured it we did all i would say is that there is a tremendous amount of planning going on were meeting weekly with the teams coming together and evaluating systems and what those the conversion on all aspects of that is going to look like and both from an employee experience from the customer experience and making sure that its going to be as seamless as it possibly can be and in many cases we expect that to be just an absolute white glove hand off from one system to the other so that from the clients perspective its just nothing but getting better so we feel very good about how thats shaping up obviously its with the delays in the approval theres thats created some timing differences from when we might be doing things versus other times but we still feel really good about that march conversion date matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great thanks guys and then last one for me just looking at the overall balance sheet on a standalone basis obviously the deal is going to muddy things here but at least on a standalone basis do you feel like earning assets continue to shrink modestly and just run down the securities portfolio to help fund loan growth aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah its obviously going to depend on what we see in terms of loan growth and deposit flows but we continue to take about million a month off the investment securities portfolio in terms of cash flow to fund loan growth and thats that gets a pickup of about basis points on that trade and that continues to expand obviously the margin trends have been very favorable we continue to hold the line on deposit pricing as best we can i think the teams doing really good on that front looking at the spot rates between june and september our total cost of deposits was only up basis points between those two so thats leaving us a lot of room to see better expansion on the earning asset yields so good overall trends matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co and do you have the monthly margin for september aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i do it was columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you operator one moment and our next question will come from chris mcgratty of kbw chris your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay apologies if i missed it we saw from one of your competitors this morning that following the integration they are tweaking some exposures to some portfolios wondering if theres any portfolios or businesses you may deemphasize and take advantage of it during the when you mark the balance sheets and put them together clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so i think i caught most of that so is the question of when we mark the balance sheet does that giving us an opportunity to step away from a certain asset class is that what youre christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah yeah if theres any portfolio big or small that on a pro forma basis you may not want the degree of ph them a little bit larger any opportunities to kind of do that at close clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah at close it does present that as an opportunity and in prior transactions weve done that andys done a masterful job over the years with a dozen or so that hes been a part of but thats something weve said its different about what we do is similar what we do and what umpqua does is similar enough but just different enough that its very complementary and there isnt anything that either of us are doing on a standalone basis that when we look at putting the balance sheet together that we dont want to continue to do and continue to maintain the expertise that we have in any particular area and leverage that across the our entire combined footprint so while it is something that is part of an opportunity that can present itself its not one that we see a need to take advantage of christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you very much clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks chris operator and i would now like to turn the call back to clint stein for closing remarks columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20oct2022 clint e stein president chief
