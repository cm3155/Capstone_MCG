franchise expansion and reinvestments made leading up to and shortly after the merger close as well as the additional million of investments planned in the coming months and quarters our expense run rate in the third quarter was just below the expected fourth quarter annualized run rate we have consistently discussed since march planned reinvestments will continue into our cost conscious culture

repeatable results ill now turn the call over to ron ronald l farnsworth executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc okay thank you clint we reported second quarter eps of and operating eps of per share and our operating return on tangible equity was while the operating ppnr was million please refer to the nongaap reconciliations provided at the end of our earnings release and presentation for details related to our calculation of operating metrics on the balance sheet we maintained our target interest bearing cash levels of approximately billion as clint mentioned loans declined million in the quarter driven mostly by reduced transactional loans and deposits in total were flat within deposits we saw the seasonal increase in noninterestbearing dda along with strong customer interestbearing deposit growth and utilized the excess to reduce broker deposits by million or along with reducing term borrowings of billion within investments the increase in available for sale investments was market value driven as the bond market rallied during the quarter the locked out structure of the portfolio combined with this rally led to the reduction in our accumulated other comprehensive loss adding or to our tangible book value per share overall tangible book value per share increased to our net interest margin was stable at in  and on the upper end of our estimated range of to our interestbearing deposit cost declined to for  given the feds basis point cut late in the quarter it may help to compare the month of september to the month of june our month of september interestbearing deposit cost was down basis points from in june more importantly the spot cost as of september was down basis points from the month of june this represents a beta of in a very short period of time and i want to thank all of our bankers and support professionals for their timely work with customers on reducing deposit rates it was great to see the speed with which they worked and it is reflective of a relationship banking strategy where our customers bank with us for the value our bankers provide not just rate columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 absent any further fed moves down we expect continued reductions in our interestbearing deposit costs in  given the ph term structure on time deposit repricing and wholesale funding along with continued expected reductions in wholesale funding balances our projected interest sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios remains in a liability sensitive position and we expect our rates down deposit betas to approximate those experienced on the way up our slide deck includes enhanced repricing and maturity disclosure including details on over billion in customer cds and wholesale funding that matures over the next six months our provision for credit loss was million for the quarter the portion related to our leasing portfolio declined again as expected this quarter to million our overall allowance for credit loss remains robust increasing to of total loans or when including the remaining credit discount total gaap expense for the quarter was million while operating expense was million in  we had the restructuring charge along with a nonrecurring credit so our operating expense of million for  was lower than the million normalized level in  and million in  reflecting continued achievement of our efficiency initiatives the  level excluding cd amortization annualizes at million clint mentioned our reinvestment plans earlier which will increase our quarterly operating expense excluding cd amortization into the annualized range of million to million we expect continued annual inflation of approximately on top of our expected  exit range inclusive of items such as the typical  payroll tax increase a increase in health insurance cost and the annual merit cycle for the end of  well always work to find additional efficiencies to help offset these pressures and enable continued franchise reinvestment now ill close with commentary about our regulatory capital position our riskbased capital ratios increased as expected in  and are now all above our longterm target levels we expect capital ratios continue to build which will provide enhanced future allocation flexibility with that i will now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you ron the stable performance of our loan portfolio highlights the strength of our throughthecycle underwriting process portfolio management and the quality of our borrowers and sponsors as we transition to a more typical credit environment after a period of exceptional quality we observed a improvement in to day delinquencies reducing them to million following similar improvements in the previous quarter the slight increase in nonaccrual loans and 90plus delinquencies reflects normal business fluctuations and the migration of smaller credits affected by higher interest rates classified loans declined due to risk rating upgrades and a payoff during the quarter our proactive and detailed monitoring of the portfolio continues to reveal no systemic issues across various industries sectors or geographic regions at the end of the quarter there were effectively no delinquencies in our entire nonowner occupied and multifamily portfolios with no chargeoffs in either category overall net chargeoffs for the company stood at an annualized rate of basis points for the quarter with the bank contributing basis points and finpac as mentioned in previous quarters loss activity within finpac was anticipated to improve and did by approximately this quarter reflective of an annualized rate of we are pleased with this progress but we are not finished we remain very satisfied with the quality and directionality of our granular and diversified loan portfolio which is detailed further in our investor presentation it remains relatively predictable and boring indiscernible waiting in line for a haircut columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 ill now turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you frank customer deposit growth during the third quarter reflects continued success through targeted small business campaigns expanding balances with existing commercial and new relationship customers customer deposit balances increased million enabling a reduction in brokered deposits notably core deposit growth occurred even as we reduced the rate on both on deposits both ahead of and following the fed funds rate reduction in september our teams continue to lead the service not price in their customer interactions our branches ramped up their summer small business campaign in july and we launched new campaign in september that will run through the next several weeks through midoctober our three highly successful campaigns have generated million in new deposits and account retention from the first two campaigns exceeds we are also seeing a related increase in cross department referrals as we work towards additional needs based solutions for our customers as a reminder there are no special products or pricing associated with these campaigns and we would like to thank our bankers for their focus and attention to driving new relationships to the bank loan balances declined by million during the quarter as we intentionally allowed transactional real estate balances to trend lower healthy customer activity which includes business and property sales as well as project completions also contributed to net portfolio contraction during the quarter we continue to target a lowsingledigit level of loan growth in the current operating environment as our activities focus on relationshipdriven commercial loans and the balanced deposit and core fee income growth that activity supports our core fee income pipelines continue to expand across all categories treasury management and commercial card income increased by and respectively for the yearto date period income from wealth management is also up notably for the period as our teams continue to find opportunities following our transition to a new broker dealer platform at the end of last year additionally our trust team is benefiting from our new larger organization handling more referrals and onboarding new relationships while overall noninterest income remains a relatively smaller percentage of our total revenue the favorable trends in our collective product and service income will drive incremental bottom line growth over time helping to diversify our revenue stream while strengthening and deepening our customer relationships ill now turn the call back over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey thanks chris we remain committed to optimizing our financial performance to drive longterm shareholder value our bankers activities and the organic runoff of transactional loans and funding sources drives us closer to optimal capital efficiency as ron mentioned our capital position continues to build and our ratios are expanding in line with our expectations with a total risk based capital ratio of at the holding company and at the bank we are above our longterm targets of our tce ratio was at quarter end up from at june as capital generation received an added lift from favorable aoci changes our performance continues to demonstrate our ability to organically generate capital well above what is required to support prudent growth and our regular dividend providing us flexibility for considering additional returns to shareholders columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 this concludes our prepared comments tory chris ron frank and i are happy to take your questions now gigi please open the call for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of matthew clark from piper sandler matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning matt matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co just on the core margin we had a fed cut obviously late in the quarter we gave us the spot rates on deposits which is really helpful but any color on kind of where your core nim kind of ph settled out at the end of september maybe on a spot basis or and just your kind of nearterm thoughts on the core nim given not only the rate changes but also your expectation for deposit flows ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey good morning matt this is ron yeah on nim i mean were not declaring a victory on the inflection point with the core up but the bigger driver is going to be again deposit flows i do feel good about the tailwinds we have with the billion of cds and wholesale funding that we laid out on that new table on slide but again i think normalized deposit flows would be the key generally in the fourth quarter we see it flat to up slightly early in the quarter and then tailing off later in the quarter this is of course longterm seasonal averages around property tax payments yearend distributions things of that nature so well see how it plays out but feel good about the tailwinds at least at this point matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the adjusted expense kind of annualized run rate guide how do you feel about that range do you feel like you could hit the low end of that range here in ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i do and more importantly as we look at that range going into we talked about the expectation for approximately inflation on that generally seasonally over the course of the year payroll taxes pop in  and  and come down a bit in   merit cycles usually into  looking forward the health insurance costs of course are throughout the year but feel good about that we know weve got quite a few reinvestments that are in flight well make continue to make additional reinvestments but youre talking only a couple million dollars a columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 quarter annualized to get into the basically midpoint of that range indiscernible right now so were pretty close matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay and then just on the buyback clint i know rates are up here more recently but definitely getting closer to that youre above where you want to be i think on regulatory capital i guess any chance i mean whats your expectation in terms of potentially buying back stock we have to wait for midnext year or do you think it could be a lot sooner clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well i mean i think that this is ongoing conversations that ron and i have with our board and were as you mentioned were above on the regulatory side the on tce is kind of a range its not a hard floor like how we view the say on total riskbased capital for example so i do think that as we set out at the onset of the announcement of the merger and what our expectations were in terms of capital generation utilization that it was going to be a capital return story for shareholders and i do think in we enter into that window and that dynamic so in terms of timing of what it might look like its probably too preliminary to really pin that down but it is something that were actively evaluating internally matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co great thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks matt operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of david feaster from raymond james david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good morning david clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 i wanted to lets start on these small business campaigns i mean you guys have had a ton of success with this retention has been extremely high im curious whether these have been more targeted to specific markets or geographies or have they been broad based and do you see additional opportunity here i guess for additional campaigns and then just to deepen the relationship with those that you won and continue driving further growth i guess on both the loan and deposit fronts christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah david this is chris thanks for the question its really been and weve talked about it previously it continues to be broad based its across all markets wide participation all branches in every campaign have achieved results in that and its really to the relationship strategy bringing in new relationships from the standpoint of getting to know people sharing what we do sharing the value that our bankers bring each and every day to those relationships and in that kind of community bank at scale the way that we think about things i think whats most impressive is we do continue to see the deepening of relationships with merchant and corporate card and some wealth management referrals treasury management referrals so the targeted businesses are things that could continue to grow with us were also uncovering larger opportunities that get referred off to the commercial bank and weve got some great partnership stories the teams working well together to land some bigger relationships as well with it but yeah its really its across the board we havent armed them with like you say any special pricing or product its everything we have off the shelf put together for the benefit of the customer and solving their needs and its working out extremely well we couldnt be more pleased going forward well take a little break here in about midnovember that everybody kind of catch up refresh and i fully expect well have something that comes out in the first quarter of next year and well continue there its kind of more of a way of life than it is a campaign if you will david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great and then you guys have also been active with expansion plans right both on the hiring side and the expanding the branch network you talked about that in the prepared remarks how do you think about opportunities going forward it seems like arizona is obviously a focus just given the branches that youre opening there but looking at the branch maps colorado utah nevada seem to be pretty attractive opportunities especially just given those hires how do you think about de novo expansion opportunities where youre focused in and whether organic the best way to do it or could ma be an opportunity to help supplement the organic expansion that youre doing torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey david this is tory ill take the first part of that and ill let chris and clint kind of weigh in at the end of it yeah we have basically four i would say de novo markets over the last year and a half or so we got utah colorado arizona and then a little bit northern california and just kind of a specialty team that weve hired into the bank and then kind of put a branch system around it some private banking folks around it to kind of like fill in this full relationship banking i mean one of the great things about the company is our really our ability to attract talent into the organization as clint mentioned earlier i mean folks want to be here and want to work here and find this place to be a great place to be successful in all of those markets the de novo markets weve been profitable within a year and theyre starting to drive some really nice balances and some growth in relationships and really a prime example is our indiscernible columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 team in northern california theyve got about million in outstanding loan balances and about million in deposits so just a really nice mix for the company and some really nice strong relationships and we see that all of our de novo markets so well continue to kind of infill on that and to grow as we are presented with the opportunity to get the right talent into the company continuously another real important market for us on the expansion plan is going to be southern california theres just tremendous density in southern california weve got some really good strong teams there today and weve been very successful and we will continue to invest in the market and grow in southern california as well so i think really good opportunity just organically for us to continue to invest in those markets and to grow quite nicely clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah and ill jump in on the back half of that question as usual david you pack a lot into your questions but from an ma perspective our focus is really getting the most performance we can out of the company that were running today and were very excited about the opportunities that we have and as tory mentioned those are de novo markets but even our long wellestablished markets i mean we continue to win new business every day and take market share from the larger banks and so theres a lot of enthusiasm around what we can just do on an organic basis the ma front itself i mean it i mean we should talk next quarter theres quite a bit of election activity going on and that whatever the outcome is it will have an impact on a bank our size and so as we get greater clarity on that as we get greater clarity on where the fed takes interest rates and how that looks our thoughts might change but right now that focus is truly on getting the most that we can out of the company that were running david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay that makes sense and then maybe just staying on the organic growth side i mean look what weve talked in the past about the pipeline your bankers have and the momentum that it seems to be picking up it hasnt necessarily materialized yet as payoffs and paydowns have been a headwind and some of the strategic runoffs in the cre book but im curious how the pipeline is shaping up where are you seeing the most opportunity as you think about that lowsingledigit pace that you talked about and just competitive landscape on the growth front from your seat torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah david its tory again the pipeline has been pretty stable and steady over the last several quarters we talked previously about the total pipeline staying about the same but the mix changing from a real estate pipeline being down a little bit and the ci pipeline up a little bit that continued even into this quarter and the overall number is about the same and its a healthy loan pipeline spread throughout the company so we feel really good about continuing the low to midsingledigit loan growth number and kind of core relationship banking excluding some of the transactional rundown and real estate that well see a little bit of as we continue go forward its a very nice pivot in the company of moving away from transactional into full relationship banking so the lending piece is just one part of it and going back to even chris comment on small business campaigns of bringing small business relationships into the bank deposit in loan and fee income relationships into the bank so when we look at the pipeline the fee income pipeline is very strong and healthy chris mentioned a couple statistics on just some growth weve had in treasury and other parts of the company and well continue to see that because the bankers are doing exceptional job focusing on all different parts of a relationship to bring into the company as we look to add value to our customers columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great thanks everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks david operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a followup on loans chris can you talk about how large that pool of transactional loans are that youre looking to reduce christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc well i think weve previously talked about between multifamily and single family was approximately billion on the balance sheet that didnt have relationships attached to them and our bankers are working to try and generate relationships thats not always the easiest thing to do but that gives you kind of a marker thats out there they come due over time so its not anything that happens tomorrow by any means but its always under evaluation jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay yeah it just it seems like there was a pretty heavy prepayment quarter for you is that strictly from that or is there anything else thats going on there torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah let me ill just this is tory ill just weigh in a little bit on that part of it one thing we did have was a very large ci loan that got paid off the customer had a really nice business that we banked for a long period of time and they sold it and somebody else wrote them a big giant check and they paid us off so that was kind of an anomaly for what we typically see but it was a pretty big number so that has an impact as well indiscernible columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay thats helpful good ron on slide its a good slide the balance sheet optimization slide well what do you want us to take away from the slide and what could make this more likely to happen ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you might take away from this is recognize its these two items together are a headwind today in a lower rate environment theyll be relatively neutral we look at it as weve isolated this as nonrelationship focus so and consistent with our strategy going forward but just more so from a visibility standpoint that were going to have a lot of optionality in the future as rates decline to reposition portions of the balance sheet reallocate capital to continue organic growth and reinvestment opportunities so really just calling out for the headwind it is today ideally in the future well be able to remove that when we get a bit lower on the rate side over time these will run down naturally based off scheduled amortization but at some point in the future well have the opportunities to deleverage this portion jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good so nothing imminent indiscernible okay ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and then just a followup on the small business deposit campaign you said thats really not rate driven but what kind of pricing on those new deposits are you offering christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc its just our normal posted rates that are out there and so theres certainly a range in there mid to upper there are some cds that are still at about but lets say its just our posted rates and nothing special that goes along with it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of andrew terrell from stephens columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc i was hoping to dig into maybe just some of the loan yield repricing dynamics the core loan yield up kind of basis points this quarter it was maybe a little better than i expected especially given the move or the leg down we saw kind of midquarter and sofr so i guess it kind of implies that some of the repricing dynamics on the fixed rate or adjustable rate is a bit better than i was thinking can you maybe just talk through some of those dynamics over the next few quarters how much you have kind of coming up thats fixed rate adjustable and the incremental spreads you think you can get on those loans ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah great questions and i want to highlight again slide of our investor presentation and jacque did a great job pulling together all that information for you bottom left just in terms of the loan portfolio between fixed maturity by period floating repricing by period and adjustable repricing by period so you can see that tail over time and also well call out again the very bottom of that table where we highlight the billion over billion of wholesale funding between brokered cds and term advances which will have repricing lower opportunities in the quarter indiscernible with the fed andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah so if im reading it right in like the four to sixmonth bucket call it 500ish million or so of fixed and adjustable repricing that sound like a fair amount kind of on a quarterly basis and then what type of spread pickup could you get on that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc spread pickup just in terms of indiscernible reprice andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah just like the whats the adjustable or the fixed rate say for the million whats the yield on that thats coming due versus where youre putting new loans on that today torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc well this is tory ill answer the new loan side i mean the new commercial production it ranges based on asset type loan type geography et cetera indiscernible ranges from the mid to mid generally columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 speaking for new loan activity and its been actually climbing just a little bit over the last several quarters but relatively stable ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah and just from a repricing standpoint theyll continue to move higher just even as rates come down the spread of course depends on the loan type which are mixed throughout those categories but well see continued repricing higher from that adjustable bucket andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc got it okay and if i could just shift gears a little bit i appreciate all the commentary around capital as well as the discussion around the buyback im just curious as you kind of have conversations with the board and you contemplate incremental capital deployment from here youve obviously also earmarked a couple of portfolios of loans that are discontinued or kind of running down over time i guess as you think about the buyback is the other contemplation potentially early exit of any of those kind of loan pools and how do you compare and contrast the attractiveness of the two clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well we were i guess in my prepared remarks i was fairly generic in terms of capital alternatives i didnt specify buybacks but i think david and you are zeroing in on that and thats certainly one of the things that we can consider in terms of an early exit from those transactional portfolios i think as frank said credit is as boring as waiting in line for a haircut and we have zero concerns about the credit quality of these portfolios and so we look at at i think in march when we first started identifying these and have been publicly talking about them created an earnings or it was an earnings headwind and it still is in terms of when you look at the wholesale funding that we have on our balance sheet the rates that were paying on that versus the yields on these loans now as rates have come down that earnings headwind is getting lighter and diminishing its still there but the market price if we were to go price these and look at it i mean we just think about it like a bond its going to price at a below par that would probably have a payback period that would exceed something that i would think is reasonable given the expectation that rates are going to continue to come down also if our deposit growth trends continue and were able to continue to replace wholesale funding levels with good core customer deposits then it really doesnt create a need to do that it will help our operating ratios itll free up some capital obviously but were broadly above our most well pretty much all our regulatory ratio targets were trending in the right direction towards where wed like to be on a tce basis so theres not a burning need or desire to do it and with zero credit concerns on these portfolios i think that the best thing for shareholders long term is to just wait it out and either let them amortize off or when rates get to a certain point then we can decide if we want to selectively exit a substantial portion of any of these portfolios andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay great i appreciate all the color there ill step back thanks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks for the question just a quick one on credit your chargeoffs were very stable your trends were very good as well any update on maybe i missed this any update on finpac normalization and any other potential offsets that youre keeping an eye on thanks frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc sure yeah as i alluded to in my remarks we finally did see some material improvement in that number for finpac with them improving about thats about annualized rate i would expect that to come down over time to somewhere in that to range so weve got a little bit to go and we do expect further improvement the fourth quarter ill say right now is going to be tempered a bit because of just the difficult nature of collection activity in the fourth quarter because of holidays vacations and just the limited days that that creates to collect accounts but they will continue to drop and i think they will settle out at that to range so delinquencies continue to decrease within that portfolio thats another indicative sign that things are trending the right way i mean from  to  delinquencies have improved and nonperforming leases have also reduced so you can see how closely those numbers tie together right i mean and we in turn saw a reduction in chargeoffs to so things are trending in the right way and theres nothing else systemically at issue within that portfolio its normal activity and nothing systemic within the commercial ci portfolio so we feel pretty good about it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay awesome thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of timur braziler from wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc my question is on the good morning the securities accretion it seems prepayments maybe were elevated again in and i know you provided some color on kind of the nearterm guide there but im just wondering the columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 last two couple quarters of elevated paydowns kind of what the remaining schedule might look like and if that accretion has maybe pulled forward a little bit versus the original guide ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean i consider it to be relatively stable over time the last two quarters it was like an individual security prepaid which gave a little bit of a pop but id expect to see that effective interest method amortization just to ratably run down over time youre not going to see a significant increase in that level unless you saw a rather large rally in the bond markets driving prepays of securities purchased say in timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay but borrowing any additional paydowns i mean should we expect that level somewhere in the low here going forward or are you saying low and rate that down is the right run rate ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc low specific to investment security discount accretion timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc right yes ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i dont have that number right in front of me here but id assume pretty consistent trends just slightly lower than we saw the last couple of quarters over the next handful of quarters timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then certainly very encouraging on the early deposit trends with the cycle to date beta already kind of in the and additional opportunities through i guess im trying to gauge the results to date versus the expectation for beta to mirror what it had been on the way up which also was somewhere in the mid is a lot of that liability sensitivity kind of frontend loaded over these next couple of quarters and then stabilizes out i guess how are you thinking about cycle to date beta versus through the cycle beta with both of those seemingly pretty similar here ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean the historical modeling would suggest its going to mirror and our disclosure suggests its going to mirror what we saw on the way to date with some of the wholesale funding weve been able to get close to that level over the course of what two weeks in september but i think in terms of the your question is really the time period of how long that plays out given the billion of wholesale funding and the shortterm nature of that its really going to be more story of whats the tail or period of the fed moving rates lower right if that all occurred over the course of a couple of quarters and then they stop then yeah thatd be your window but if its over a longer period of time that will just continue to reprice lower kind of like the conversation we had earlier on columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24oct2024 the billion of nonrelationship loans and multifamily single family resi its a headwind today at some point its going to be relatively neutral going to give us a lot of optionality timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the questions ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of anthony elian from jpmorgan anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everyone just a quick followup on nim so your adjusted nim increased about basis points in the third quarter but just given the tailwinds you outlined on this call and on slide on the funding side of the balance sheet and the full benefit of the september cut is it reasonable to assume a similar level of increase in the adjusted nim in the fourth quarter or i guess what would hold you back from realizing a similar increase thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc itd be bouncing along the bottom and again deposit flows will have such a bigger impact on that
