further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release or website or our sec filings aaron aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you clint and good morning everyone pretax preprovision income rose by million on a linked quarter basis to million the increase was driven by a combination of rising interest income higher non interest income and lower operating expenses most notably with declines in mergerrelated costs and compensation and benefit costs including the impact of some onetime items i will discuss in a moment total deposits ended the quarter at billion which was a decrease of million for the quarter but up billion from a year earlier with billion coming from our merchants acquisition the linked quarter decrease was largely consistent with prepandemic seasonal trends our cost of deposits edged up basis point to basis points total loans rose by million during the quarter to billion after factoring in ppp balances loans increased by ph million or annualized growth was propelled by million in new loan originations and a point increase in our loan utilization rate two years after the launch of the paycheck protection program most of the billion in loans we funded in communities throughout our footprint are now forgiven and paid off by the sba as of june only million of ppp balances remain total investment securities decreased million during the quarter to billion which was available for sale and held to maturity the quarterly decrease was driven by both the fair value mark on our afs portfolio as well as maturities premium amortization and paydowns no new purchases were made during the quarter the expected yield in the current portfolio is up basis points during the quarter the net interest margin increased basis points on a linked quarter basis to largely due to the shift in earning assets and fed funds into higher yielding loans excluding the basis point differential of premium amortization on acquired loans and securities and the basis point differential in accelerated ppp fees between the two quarters the margin increased basis points sequentially new loans were brought on an average tax adjusted coupon rate of which is up from in the first quarter and the coupon rate on the overall portfolio excluding ppp increased from to more recent production is coming out at even higher rates and with ph more loans lifting off lower rates we should see those benefits more fully reflected in our third quarter results noninterest income increased linked quarter by to million service charges and deposits excuse me service charges and deposit accounts increased by million largely due to increase in sweep account fees which are reported on a gross basis with a similar offsetting amount recording to legal and professional expense loan revenue increased by mostly driven by an increase in our loan production and prepayment penalties but partly offset by the cyclical decline in mortgage banking revenue other non interest income declined by largely because of onetime gains we recorded in the first quarter for the second quarter we still had million in nonrecurring income including a boli benefit and a payment for our participation in an oregon disaster relief program noninterest expense decreased by million linked quarter to million adjusting for mergerrelated expenses of million in the second quarter and million in the first quarter noninterest expense decreased by million to million the linked quarter decrease was due to several factors largely columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 affecting the compensation and benefits line for one the first quarter included roughly million of seasonally elevated payroll taxes and benefit costs meanwhile the second quarter benefited by about million from benefit accrual and funding adjustments and finally the second quarter also benefited from fas capitalized loan origination costs owing to the very strong loan production in the period and that reduced compensation expense by about million compared to the first quarter and about million compared to the average over recent periods finally occupancy and data processing costs also declined some of which stemmed from the completion of our merchants bank core conversion back in march we anticipate our normalized expense run rate excluding merger costs to be in the mid the provision for income taxes increased on a linked quarter basis to million representing a effective rate we continue to expect our tax rate to be in the to range but perhaps toward the higher end of that range given our higher profitability lastly as i discussed last quarter the rising interest rates resulted in a negative fair value mark on our investment portfolio reflected through accumulated other comprehensive income while this mark does not affect our regulatory capital ratios it does weigh on our tangible common equity ratio and tangible book value excluding asci however both our tce ratio and our tangible book value increased during the quarter and with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron our forward momentum is accelerating as we exit the pandemic and in anticipation of upcoming combination with umpqua holdings in a very competitive market columbias bankers are continuing to take care of existing clients while simultaneously finding and driving new business as mentioned earlier in the call loan growth was outstanding exppp loan production of million was another record shattering the old record of million set just two quarters ago about of the growth in the loan portfolio was due to increase in line utilization primarily in the agricultural and finance sectors with the remaining growth driven by record production predominantly in real estate leasing healthcare agriculture and construction sectors new production was sourced from washington from oregon from california from idaho and the remaining from outside of our footprint to our specialty tribal and national healthcare teams approximately million of the new balances was from clients with commitments of greater than million notwithstanding the strong production during the quarter our pipelines continued to expand and remain to our satisfaction the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable term loans represented million of total new production while lines accounted for million the overall portfolio mix is now fixed floating and variable over the past months we have seen a shift from ci towards cre loans which now makes up of the portfolio up from one year ago this shift can be partly attributed to the payoff of million of net ppp loans during the year as a result of higher rates we continue to see a decline in our mortgage warehouse business during the quarter with sold loans dropping from million to million which compares to million in the second quarter of overall the composition of the loan portfolio did not change materially even with the increase in line utilization deposits declined million during the second quarter which is normal due to seasonal business activity the mix remained consistent at noninterest bearing and interest bearing the composition also remained columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 consistent with commercial and retail if seasonal patterns hold deposit balances will pick up in the third quarter through the remainder of the year earlier this month we announced the expansion of our footprint into utah adding a highly experienced commercial lending team in the salt lake city market in addition we continue to invest in our retail network with our newest financial hub opening next week in a vibrant attractive district of tacoma financial hubs are full service locations that are uniquely focused on helping our clients achieve their comprehensive financial goals including investments trust services and other financial considerations both producers and clients across our footprint see the value of the upcoming combination with umpqua and the increased capabilities that it will bring our bankers are doing a great job remaining outwardly focused expanding our customer base while generating highquality loans and longterm deposit relationships during a time when many companies would be internally focused now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks chris for the quarter we had a million to our allowance the additional reserve was primarily driven by loan growth during the quarter and a less favorable economic forecast last quarter the unemployment rate was expected to end at and remain at or below prepandemic levels throughout the forecast period the current forecast assumes the unemployment rate will end at and remain above pre pandemic levels throughout the forecast period last quarter the full year gdp growth expectations for was the current forecast assumes full year gdp growth expectations for of and assumes gdp will remain below throughout the forecast period offsetting loan growth and the less favorable economic forecast was a continuation in the trend of improving credit metrics and to a lesser extent net recoveries of about as i mentioned a moment ago our credit trends continue to move in a positive direction albeit at a more modest pace nonperforming loans remain low at only basis points of period in loans and substandard loans declined million during the quarter and now represent less than of total loans special mentioned loans are less than of total loans for the year problem loans those rated watch or worse have declined million the banks impaired asset ratio has also declined from to given these metrics our allowance going forward will continue to be driven primarily by loan growth and the economic forecasts in summary while we are seeing credit quality metrics similar to that which we enjoyed prepandemic we remain cognizant of the current global environment and instability in europe rising interest rates especially their impact on housing and inflationary pressures here at home so while we are optimistic for the future performance of the portfolio near term we remain cautious as we look further down the road okay back to you clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andy this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now victor lets open the line for questions columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 question and answer section operator all right operator instructions our first question comes from the line of david feaster from raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just starting on deposits obviously you guys have a phenomenal lowcost core deposit franchise but im just curious maybe if you could walk through some of the underlying trends that youre seeing especially since quarter end where it sounds like in the market that were hearing more conversations about exception pricing in those types of things in migration within books just curious whether theres any interesting trends youve seen within your book and what drove the runoff is it more munis or anything like that and then just any other trends worth highlighting and whether youd expect more outflows potentially for the remainder of the year clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so youve got chris and aaron fighting across the table to decide who gets to answer this first so im going to jump in and just steal their thunder and what we saw the second quarter really was started to feel a lot like our seasonal patterns that weve had prepandemic and i think it was in chris comments that he mentioned that those traditional patterns hold true in the third quarter and for the balance of the year that we should see some deposit growth come back in and id say that so far at this point in the third quarter we are seeing those historical seasonal patterns of deposit growth and on a overall basis we werent down materially in the second quarter we move around million million from day to day so sometimes its just a matter of that focal date of june and somebody laid a big deposit on us or system cash out so ill step back now and let chris and aaron continue their argument over whos going to fill in the details christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc hey david this is chris ill provide a little color to the outflows as weve always talked weve talked about controlling our deposit costs through using wealth management cb financial and during the quarter of that number about million was the net movement to cb financial to take advantage of some higher rate opportunities the exception pricing we still continue to utilize that its trending kind of is the normal maybe a little bit more with whats going on in the market but overall the base of our deposit funding is very consistent to where it was well continue to see what happens with the competition and things of that nature but were really following the playbook that weve always had and its as of today its continuing to bear out columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just look its extremely impressive to see record origination in production and if i heard correctly that youre continuing to see expanding pipelines like that combination is really impressive im just curious what do you think is allowing you to be so successful i mean is it the economic recovery is it some of your new hires is it people excited about the deal im just curious as you step back and look at it what do you think is allowing you to be so successful and is this kind of continued pace of growth sustainable especially as we look at higher rates and potential deceleration in originations but you also got the prospects of slower payoffs and paydowns just any high level thoughts clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so i think it really starts with a conscious decision that we made in the second quarter of while a lot of our competitors shuttered their operations scattered their teams and tried to run their banks from the basement of their vacation homes we were here every day and we continue just serving the needs of our communities and taking care of our clients and a lot of the business that weve won over the last couple of years our prospects that weve called on for in some cases plus years and they just didnt really like the experience or the lack of availability of their existing bank andor their existing bank pulled out of certain markets and so i think that that that momentum that we didnt lose the momentum that a lot of i think end market competitors lost and so theyve been trying to regain some momentum weve just continued to accelerate and i think that approach has also helped us to attract great talent with some of the hires that weve talked about and some many that we havent we continue to attract a lot of great bankers across the footprint and the announcement on our utah team is just the most recent example of that type of activity and so i think its not something where we just flipped the switch and we had a lot of momentum actually going into coming out of we were starting off the first quarter it was shaping up to be a tremendous first quarter of and then of course the pandemic hit and everything kind of came to a standstill so i dont know if that gives you everything you want or if chris wants to add some additional context or not but thats really i think its not something that its just started its something that weve been very focused on for a few years now christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah audio gap id add on the aspect of just backing up the our bankers are out and about theyre very proactive and staying focused as you look towards the pending combination the integration management office is doing a fantastic job so that our bankers can focus on all the stuff that they do externally and then that team continues to work internally on all of the stuff that happens on day one as far as when you look at how it kind of all came together specifically to production theres certainly been some pentup demand that came through i think the second quarter you saw a little bit of and some things that came through some taking advantage of the lower rates before things started to rise that certainly helped with it as well we were able to take advantage of those get into some new deals while retaining a lot of our own business as well i think your question about is it sustainable thats certainly one of the unknown questions and which weve talked before i hesitate to speculate that well set record after record but im very comfortable with what our teams are doing and i think theres going to be a natural summer pullback as well and well see how it plays out for the rest of the year columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc but its truly it truly was incredible david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats yeah thats great and maybe just touching on asset quality and giving andy a little airtime you guys always maintain a conservative approach to credit and weve seen continued improvement in asset quality and you guys talked about it theres some real challenges in the economy im just curious at a high level your thoughts on the credit outlook from your all standpoint and in the pulse of the clients as you look out are there any segments that youre maybe a bit more cautious on are there any segments where youre maybe seeing clients pull back or that youre avoiding and then on the other side i mean what is your appetite for credit at this point and have you guys begun tightening standards andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc well first of all our appetite remains consistent through all of the cycles and i think that that for our customers and for our prospects makes us i think predictable and they like that so were not in and out of segments and we dont adjust our underwriting criteria to get more loans or get less and stuff like that we try to be very consistent throughout the entire cycle so our risk appetite remains the same overall yeah credit is looking really good i hate to say its probably as good as its going to get but i guess i just said it and so really the economy will be a big driver of how we move forward the segments that are under stress i mean we continue to be concerned with hospitality a little bit but i think weve got our arms around that and most of that i think is pretty well taken care of but it remains for certain kinds of especially if its business travel related that remains a challenge versus vacation elderly care yeah the pandemic theoretically is over but not in assisted living and nursing care facility because it only takes a small outbreak and then they get they cant take in new people theres still a reluctance for a lot of people to place their mother or their father into those facilities and theyre designed in such a way that they need relatively high occupancy to cover the fixed costs of running the facility so elderly cares there we dont have a big bucket of elderly care but its less than million for us but almost all of it is exhibiting some kind of stress i think on a broader case im not going to tell you anything you dont already know but a lot of businesses are still struggling to find employees and in the restaurant area theyre open but they cant run at full capacity because they dont have enough servers and so that impacts their ability to generate revenue grocery stores are closing delis which happened to me the other day because they dont have enough people to staff the deli so a lot of businesses are really struggling and inflation so far is running ahead of wages so real nominal consumer spending hasnt really increased but i do and i think have some concerns over continued wage inflation and really begin to exceed the commodity side of inflation if you will so thats probably the longer term the concern in the portfolio columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful thanks guys andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks david operator thank you one moment for our next question operator instructions our next question is from the line of matthew clark from piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc good morning matt matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co maybe just to close the loop on credit andy i dont think you mentioned office but that seems to be another kind of longer term concern for audio gap weve heard property values in certain metro market that i dont think you really dabble in that much values there could be are you seeing anything like that in any of your markets i know im sure a lot of what you have is suburban office but any color around the office would be great andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah certainly the downtown core of seattle and portland are the weakest office markets but those buildings are way bigger than what we ever get involved in but it does impact the region a bit and you are correct were primarily in the suburban and rural markets most of our office is actually walkup two three story 2x4 construction youve got the veterinary clinic the dentist maybe an architect and a law firm in it so our office composition is not sort of what you would be reading about in the wall street journal matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co got it okay andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc indiscernible i dont know where large buildings in seattle are trading because thats not the market we play in but i would say that in general cap rates remain extremely low because theres so much money looking for a home and so while we arent seeing the same inflationary pressures in real estate values they are holding but theyre just not increasing so well have to wait and see as rates continue to rise by the fed if cap rates rise columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 then youll see values but right now theres a lot of money looking for homes in just about every segment of the real estate market matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then shifting gears to the margin aaron technical difficulty have the margin the average margin in the month of june and as a followup but what the spot rate was on at the end of june and the weighted average rate on new loans going into aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc the so we did see margin improvement through the quarter the new coupon on loans in june was ph that compares obviously favorably to the average for the quarter so were seeing good directional lift there and i think our you asked about the margin the margin overall for june was on an operating basis was ph that was up about i think from ph in the march month of march so again good directional trends there but one of the things that i want to point out because i think its an important point and weve talked about this in the past where theres with the inflection of margin trends we always said it was going to take a little bit of time before we really saw that pullthrough and a big part of that stems from the floors that we have on our loans and weve got some pretty good breakout on slide of our investor deck that we kind of show this and if you look back to the march quarter we had about billion of loans that were still subject to floors and moving forward to june that number dropped to about billion and most of that would need just a basis point change in the fed funds to lift off floors and obviously with next weeks anticipated fomc meeting were going to get something well above that so with that we will have over billion of loans that will be adjustable with rate resets that should be come in pretty short order so we should start to see a much better impact from the rate hikes coming forward matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then i dont know if you mentioned it during your prepared remarks any guidance for the upcoming quarter on a standalone basis from a noninterest expense perspective assuming production flows capitalized deferred fas91 i would assume those would increase but any guide around that run rate aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah were still looking for something in the mid matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then maybe clint could you give us an update on kind of what youre hearing as it relates to the approval process if anything and im sure its frustrating but just any color you might have and whether or not we might need to see the usbs acquisition have to get approval first or not clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 yeah i mean its a process and we would like to have complete transparency and into the timeline for the approval process but unfortunately thats just not the way that it works and weve been through this before with prior deals where the process has to run its course but were not were not wasting any time to the extent that we can continue to prepare ourselves for when we do receive approval and move quickly towards closing theres not anything that jumps out that from my perspective that creates any type of an anomaly or makes the approval process more challenging or difficult i dont know if that that helps you or not but its just were just going through the normal process i dont know the answer specifically on if our deal is in line behind the us bank deal i think we announced about roughly days or so after they did so i know the doj is very busy but i dont have visibility into everything in terms of what theyre actually working on at any given point in time but i do know that our application is being worked on and while its the delay is a little bit frustrating the real value that we feel that this combination creates for all of our stakeholders is a longterm decision and so if its a matter of a few months here on the front end it doesnt change our excitement or expectation for the benefits of this combination to all of our stakeholders matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of j rulis from da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning just a couple of questions on maybe production chris could you tell us the pipeline as we sit today versus where you sat at the same point in the second quarter christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc its very similar to what was going in the second quarter i wont give an absolute figure on that but yeah its very similar jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and chris is there this is pretty specific but thinking about the utah expansion and those individuals is there any kind of noncompete there do you think that their book of business can hit beginning in the third quarter any timing there or could we assume we could see some positive impact from that group immediately christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah theyve been on for about a month now and so couple weeks in total and when you look at it theres always or typically there could be a nonsolicit or anything of that nature were not really we dont build these teams in expansions on what necessarily can come from their existing book its really more about whats the go forward how active are they in the market and how quickly can they seize on new opportunities the books they tend to be fairly well especially in a rising rate environment they tend to its really hard to pull somebody when columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 you go in and offer them a higher rate today than what they had where theyre currently at so thatll take a little bit more time were really comfortable with these teams that they are the external sourcing types of bankers that we typically attract and bring on board so from that standpoint the team that started with us earlier in january they certainly hit the ground running into the second quarter so 90ish days i do know there are some opportunities that we are working on currently and theyre already in there and so yeah i would expect that you start seeing something new to the maybe not in the third quarter here but certainly moving into the fourth quarter jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it thank you and aaron appreciate kind of some of the touch points you gave on margin throughout the quarter a specific question to sort of cash and equivalent balances as those were worked down was that pretty steady through the quarter was it early part or late anything on timing of how those balances moved aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no i mean there was a little bit of variability around this you could tell like in april when you had a lot of tax payments going out and things like that there was some bigger variances but now i would say in terms of how that loan is those funds were used for loan funding it was a pretty steady flow through the core jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and may be a last one perhaps for clint just i believe kind of organizational charts have been shared umpqua and colb i guess is is the next sort of point of stress if you think about the combined employee base would that be a closing a conversion or is there anything more internal that as you work through as you said youre not sitting idly by youre preparing im just thinking more of the personnel that could be pressure points of when companies are come together anything like between now and close or conversion that would also come up in that timeline clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i think just the length of time that were in right now this period that were in waiting on regulatory approval that weighs on some folks i mean part of the bringing the companies together we have in both organizations today leaders and individuals that want to retire and through a normal course of business when somebody retires they can pick a date you have a big party they plan a trip and they leave town for a month well we dont know if thats exactly when to have that party for them and so ive seen that theres a few individuals here in our corporate headquarters that are in that situation and so that creates i guess a point of frustration for them i think that were still running two separate companies and were planning for what we are when we come together so in essence its like youve got two jobs youre doing your job today at columbia bank or at umpqua bank but then youre also thinking towards the future and so i think that that once we get to the close some of that pressure gets released from the organization there are situations where there is one job for two people and to your earlier comment about org charts and things those have been communicated and so thats the other piece of where depending on at what point in the process if its at the close if its days postclose if its days postconversion and those that are centered around the conversion now they still have some pretty good columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jul2022 certainty around the timing of what that looks like but those that are centered or based on the actual closing of the merger they dont really they dont really know exactly when that date will be so i think that i guess those are kind of the different scenarios that i think about but all in all across both organizations theres still tremendous amount of excitement the opportunity that this creates for all of our stakeholders our clients ive been doing a lot of client visits in the last couple of months and some of them theyre surprised to find out that the merger hasnt closed and theyre excited to have greater access to our bankers greater availability of products and services so i dont want to take your question and just focus on the pressure points of the organization i think that the excitement still far outweighs anything in terms of just the normal course of merger type integration work jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah appreciate it clint that just it wasnt a negatively pointed just to kind of walk through the process so thats helpful and appreciate the feedback thanks operator thank you im not showing any for the questions in the queue id like to turn the call back over to clint stein for any closing remarks clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well thanks victor and thank you for joining
