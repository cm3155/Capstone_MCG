leaders and teams alongside our seasoned longtime bankers continue to win new business and expand existing relationships this activity has thrived despite the ongoing preparation for the integration of columbia and umpqua im very proud of what our team accomplished during the first quarter in addition to closing the merger we also completed two branch divestiture projects and successfully converted our core systems careful planning and the dedication of our exceptionally talented team enabled us to achieve these accomplishments columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 i want to thank our associates for their commitment and diligence throughout this busy period it has enabled us to remain on track to realize our targeted cost savings by the end of the third quarter in addition to the heightened activity surrounding the merger our associates were also engaged with customers throughout the industry events that unfolded in march we were uniquely positioned during this period given our robust customer engagement surrounding the core systems conversion our teams were able to expand conversations already taking place to discuss columbias diversified business model granular deposit base and tailored solutions for those looking to add products like our insured cash sweep service it was a historic first quarter for our company our customers associates and communities are already benefiting from enhancements provided by the merger we remain committed to supporting communities throughout our eightstate footprint as evidenced by our fiveyear billion community benefits agreement this agreement supports community development expanded homeownership and small business formation in that light im pleased to announce we contributed million to the umpqua bank charitable foundation in march with the merger closed our shareholders will quickly begin to realize the expected benefits of our strengthened operations and improved financial performance along with significant capital accretion and now ill turn the call over to you ron ronald l farnsworth executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc okay thank you clint and for those on the call who want to follow along i will be referring to certain page numbers from our earnings presentation starting on slide now that weve closed the merger we present here updated overall financial metrics expected as compared to the original projections in october of the changes in fair value since then led to significant raterelated discounts which will accrete to interest income over time with that our tangible book dilution was larger but our expected gaap accretion and return on tangible equity increases significantly with a similar earnback with our core system conversion completed a month ago we are on track to achieve our expected cost synergies of million on an annualized basis by the end of the third quarter this year next on slide we present updated fair value marks at closing as compared to announcement given the increase in treasury yields and inversion of the versus spreads since announcement we ended with billion in discount marks with all but million of that related to rate again these rate discounts will accrete to interest income providing a significant and stable additional earnings stream over time which well highlight in a few minutes also noted lower in the page is the larger core deposit intangible balance which will be amortized to expense over time on slide we carry forward the discount marks and cdi at closing and also present the current balances as of quarter end for the afs securities discount the decline from closing to quarter end resulted from writing off existing premiums at close of roughly million along with removing the discounts of million on the billion of bonds sold as part of a restructuring the remaining decline of approximately million was accreted to interest income slide projects our cost synergy realization estimate at quarter end through the year on an annualized basis we estimate weve realized million of cost synergies in the month of march run rate with an additional million achieved post conversion which will reduce our run rate in april looking forward we expect to realize a further million to million in annualized cost savings by the end of the second quarter or approximately million to million on a quarterly basis achieving these synergies evenly throughout the quarter columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 slide covers our liquidity including deposit flows during the quarter for comparability we presented the table on the left as if we were combined for all periods presented total deposits declined in the first quarter or when excluding the divestiture required with the combination market liquidity tightening and the impact of inflation on consumer spending continued to pressure customer deposit balances we utilized shortterm federal home loan bank borrowings to fund the outflows along with adding billion for higher on balance sheet liquidity the upper right table details our off balance sheet liquidity with billion available as of quarter end below that we had cash and excess bond collateral not pledged for lines to arrive at total available liquidity of billion this represents of uninsured deposits as of quarter end on the next page slide we detail out the investment portfolio the upper left table takes you from current par to amortized cost to fair value noting the difference between current par and amortized cost is the combined net discount which will be accreted to interest income over time the million of gross unrealized gains at quarter end came primarily from the marked columbia portfolio as the bond market rallied in march while the gross unrealized losses related to the prior umpqua bonds which were not marked i mentioned earlier we saw billion of marked columbia bonds the first week of march and reinvested billion as part of a restructuring we sold frontend cash flows and purchased longer dated bonds to extend duration slightly benefiting our interest rate sensitivity which ill cover in a few minutes the chart on the right breaks out the overall portfolio between the portion with unrealized gains versus losses noting billion of the book is in a gain position with a book yield of as of quarter end as you can tell im excited about this portfolio as it gives us significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality the overall book yield is with an effective duration of at quarterend and lastly we only have million in ph hgm bonds which represents some crarelated bonds with no unrealized loss now to better help investors given the combination accounting and moving parts on slide we provide an updated outlook for the remainder of the year on several key financial statement items the accretion estimates noted on the lower half of the table accrete based on the effective interest method meaning they should be fairly stable in the near term and declining slightly over the life of the portfolios they will provide significant interest income and capital build over time we also provide an updated outlook for our quarterly expense run rate which we expect to be in the million to million range in  when cdi amortization and merger expenses are excluded we expect this level to trend down to million and million in  reflecting the expected achievement of all communicated expense synergies by the end of the third quarter slides through provide summary financials for  but i want to take you forward to slide here we break out  gaap earnings to help investors understand the nonoperating and merger related impacts and resulting poor bank results in the far right column the first column represents our  gaap results with a net loss of million driven entirely by merger expense along with the initial acl provision the second column includes our nonoperating destination for income statement changes mostly related to fair value swings along with million of merger costs included in noninterest expense which are detailed in the appendix these net to an million reduction in  earnings resulting in a third column for operating income this is the key page the bridge from gaap reported earnings isolating nonoperating fair value changes in the merger related items of discount accretion cdi amortization and the cecl ph day two double account then to adjusted operating income columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 now in the mergerrelated items column we have million of net discount accretion from the march discussed earlier for one month along with the million initial acl provision commonly referred to as the cecl ph day two double account also included is million of cdi amortization for the one month the value in this column will be a clear view of the net earnings impact from the merger accounting which will be substantial and again build capital over time and that takes us to the far right column which presents the bank excluding the merger accounting marks again the interest rate environment introduced a significant amount of purchase accounting accretion and amortization into our reported earnings and slide breaks out the components this will enable investors to view the earnings power of columbia outside purchase accounting adjustments while also seeing the meaningful net capital generation we expect these adjustments to produce over time okay with that moving ahead for a couple more items slide breaks out accretion from net interest income and slide does the same for the margin in the footnote we highlight the nim for just the month of march with as reported and excluding the accretion the excess liquidity held on balance sheet had a basis point impact on the month of march nim but an insignificant impact on net interest income slide breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio noting is fixed is floating and are adjustable slide provides an updated view of our combined interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios weve taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a potential declining rate environment including the bond portfolio restructuring discussed earlier along with using shortterm wholesale borrowings combined with more locked out bond cash flows this acts like a swap for ph rates down environments you can see here the trend over the past few quarters where a ratesdown risk has been reduced significantly and noted below we calculate our cycletodate funding betas which are calculated on a combined company basis over the periods presented for comparability as of the first quarter our interestbearing deposit portfolio has priced in of the fed funds rate increases notably here is the cost of interestbearing deposits which was for the month of march compared with the quarterend spot rate of highlighting stability and with that i will now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you ron turning to slide the addition of the historical columbia loans at fair value was the primary driver of the quarters loan growth as new originations were nearly offset by payment activity slide details select characteristics of our loan portfolio by major category with added details surrounding production during the first quarter our portfolio is diversified by mix and geography average loan size displays the granularity of the portfolio and where applicable average loantovalue and debt service coverage supports the quality of our underwriting additional industry detail for our commercial portfolio is provided on slide further highlighting our diversification by industry and collateral type lets spend a little time on slide which provides an overview of our office portfolio in response to increased investor focus on this asset category like other verticals our office portfolio is characterized by a diversified mix columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 of granular loans that exhibit strong credit metrics our average office loan is million the average loanto value of the portfolio is and the average debt service coverage of the nonowner occupied portion of the portfolio is approximately times properties are located across our broad western footprint and majority are in suburban markets we have very limited exposure to core downtown metro markets of our office loans have a guarantee in place and performance of the portfolio remains exceptional pastdue and nonaccrual levels are de minimis at a combined million and criticized balances represent only of the overall portfolio and less than basis points of our total loan portfolio we remain very comfortable with our office exposure given the characteristics ive outlined moving on slide highlights our reserve coverage by loan category with the majority of the quarters billed driven by million added as part of the merger for historical columbia pcd loans and million initial provision booked for nonpcd loans the remaining million provision expense primarily reflects changes in the economic forecasts using credit models slide provides an overview for our consolidated credit trends and notes the additional basis points the remaining credit discount on loans adds to our lossabsorbing capacity overall our credit trends are benign outside the anticipated trend and finpac chargeoffs delinquency in chargeoff activity in the finpac portfolio remains centered in the trucking sector of the portfolio and we believe delinquencies in this area have reached a plateau as the supplydemand imbalance in this specific space evens out these factors drive our expectations for another quarter of elevated chargeoffs in the finpac portfolio as delinquencies continue to roll through the later delinquency bands we continue to view these trends as isolated to the finpac portfolio given the unique characteristics of their obligors and we have obviously witnessed no spillover to the broader commercial portfolio or other sectors within the finpac portfolio excluding finpac chargeoff activity at the bank remains at a de minimis level so classified asset ratios did increase they do not represent any notable changes in classified asset balances when viewing the combined portfolio i will now turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you frank shifting the focus to deposits slide highlights the quality of our portfolio of balances are in noninterestbearing accounts of the overall consumer balances comprised of our base with the average account balance at commercial balances make up the remaining of our deposit portfolio with the average account balance at the company offers multiple deposit solutions like our insured cash sweep service the ability to collateralize select accounts and opportunities for enhanced returns through columbia wealth management these products provide our customers with the flexibility they seek and improve the stability of our granular deposit base at quarterend just of our deposit portfolio was uninsured screening on the lower end of peer averages net contraction in our deposit balances on an organic basis during the quarter reflects normal customer uses of cash the impact of inflation on spending and market liquidity tightening offsetting these headwinds to net expansion was continued growth in new account balances as customers transferred funds into recently opened accounts throughout the quarter we also continued the development of our franchise throughout the west columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 with the merger closed we now have deposit and other capabilities in utah which further enables us to bring full banking relationships to the company we will continue to invest in this market and throughout our other geographies we believe this will lead to enhanced longterm organic growth opportunities with the core systems conversion now complete our teams have an invigorated focus on generating balanced growth for our franchise relationship banking within our communities drives our purpose and our broader footprint expanded set of products and services and our collaborative spirit across our teams support our expectations for continued success and now back to you clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks chris our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide we remain above both wellcapitalized and internal threshold targets and as ron outlined we expect capital to free quickly in the coming quarters as a result of the merger we have adjusted our dividend declaration timeline so that it is similar to the one previously utilized by umpqua holdings this concludes our prepared comments the team is now available to answer your questions so valerie please open the call for qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions one moment for our first question our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon a good afternoon jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co i guess to start appreciate all the detail in the deck maybe id go first to the cost or the expense run rate ron you kind of rattled through that i missed kind of those ph first step as you go through the through  and i guess you ended at million to million in  but could you repeat that piece again ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i think you summarize it well weve got million we have included within our run rate for the month of march theres another million that is in place but at the end of the quarter which will be reflected in  so columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 we talked about that and then on that slide we show you the ramp for the additional million to million we expect to achieve on annualized basis in  which will put us at the million level by the end of  jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc million to million additional in second quarter and then the balance in  will end at annualized again at the end of  and looking forward in the guidance we gave for  on the expense side reflects those trends along with the  amount noted in the farright note column on that outlook page jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay great thank you and then the i guess if i were to jump to capital your comment about expect to accrete that quickly and i just i dont know if youve got projections on kind of yearend or expectations for those capital levels and i guess thats question one question two would be other tools with the deal closed now do you look at the buyback the other ways of deploying that capital as that grows ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey jeff this is ron on the first one very much we have forecast on the capital build and its going to be a range of to bps on the riskbased measures across the various separations over the course of the year and into the following year and the year after thats got a long life this would be a longlife level of accretion that also ph interestingly enough just given the nature of how rates have moved up over the last year youd have to go significantly below where rates were prior to last year in order to see a real acceleration in prepay on a lot of those instruments so excited about that that bps would be a quarterly accretion in the capital ratios clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah and jeff this is clint ill just add that as you do the math in terms of just what the accretion adds and then factor in earnings and you can pretty quickly reconcile rons comments and mine about the capital generation and the capabilities of the company with respect to a buyback i dont see anything this year i think that just all the volatility thats out there and the fact that well be building in the next couple of quarters to our longstated longterm target capital ratios well let that occur and then if market conditions are favorable by all means itd be something that ron and myself would have a discussion with our board and make sure that were being good stewards and keeping the appropriate amount of capital so we have flexibility to run our business through the entirety of any cycle but also not have too much capital sitting around that hurts our returns for our shareholders jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 okay thank you and then maybe one last one for chris just on the deposit side could you comment on flows in april so far is kind of the first part of that and then second you talked about expanding tools in the utah and i guess your expectations for the growth through the end of the year if you think you could scratch it from ph levels thanks christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc sure into april with the conversion behind us still early behind that youre looking at getting some people back out into the markets weve also launched our own deposit promotion trends are good on that out of the gate and thats been out for a couple weeks more though im starting to see and i know torys seen this as well were seeing clients and prospects that are coming to us requesting new business now i cant put a dollar amount on it for you right at this time but its certainly a very positive sign to see the new business flow thats coming in as well as the multiple conversations that are going on with existing clients around one retaining their deposits and two looking at opportunities they might have with funds that are held elsewhere expanding into utah we should be up and going sometime during the quarter to attracting the actual deposits and would expect that team would hit the ground running on the loan side to be able to drive a good amount again i cant put a dollar amount on it of exactly what we would get but were very weve always been excited about the market and i dont see the experienced bankers that we have having any trouble bringing in deposits on that and then we will look into the other states where we have loan production offices as well and i would say more to come on that but were certainly looking to be full service across all eight states and i dont know tory did you want to add anything torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no jeff this is tory nixon i think the only thing i would add is that for the first three weeks of april deposit balances are down just a little bit mostly in retail and consumer banking and thats like typical tax payments and just kind of traditional outflow not significant at all and to chris point a lot of activity inside the commercial bank on new relationships prospecting funds deposit funds from for our customers from other institutions so a lot of really really good activity jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co i guess put in another way i guess by yearend are you looking at you know in your budget from the ph jump point deposit balances are you in a stable down or up type mindset torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah no i think theres a really great opportunity for us to grow the balances of the company and we all hands on deck to do that we are continuing to focus on ci relationships and full banking relationships and what comes with that is core deposits fee income i mean all those things that drive value for the company clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc and jeff ill just add theres a bit of a wild card in there and thats it appears that weve returned to kind of seasonal patterns that we havent had for since precovid and if you go back prior to and throughout the history of the company a lot of the deposit positive deposit flows occur in the second half of the year and they columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 start to build late second quarter so in addition to the activities that tory mentioned and chris theres that seasonal pattern and i would expect that that will return and behave as weve seen in the past but then the feds still removing liquidity from the system and so and i think theres still just from an industry perspective theres still some of that activity thats yet to occur so thats why its hard to just tell you yeah its up x percent but i think i share the teams optimism on our ability to take market share and the conversations that were having and that gets back to my prepared remarks along the lines of not only the new teams but our seasoned bankers theyre continuing to win new business and deepen those existing relationships and so i think those activities no matter what happens at a macro level youll see the positive benefit to our balance sheet jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate it operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of david feaster of raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon everybody a good afternoon david a hi david a hi david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just kind of staying on the deposit side id be curious maybe some of the flows that you saw in the quarter if you could just talk a bit about you talked about a lot of its really a function of the declining balances in existing customers im curious whether you saw that more on the commercial or the retail side and how much is that seasonality versus customers utilizing cash to pay down the highercost floating rate debt migration into the wealth or versus turmoil from the banking failures or even the conversion ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 david this is ron let me take a crack at that pretty wideranging but id say overall traditionally seasonally its like a bell curve over the course of the year right stronger   a little bit more pressure   depending on the segment etcetera and on page we did lay out the changes in deposits in that upperleft table as if we were pooled or combined on a basis for comparability purposes ph and like when we look at the ex broker or the divestitures or the public deposit change on the customer account side its pretty evenly balanced between commercial and consumer similar to just the overall mix of the portfolio right i think on the consumer side it feels like a similar continuation of the inflation story we talked about last quarter for were looking at  results on the commercial side similar so just the kind of effects of qt at the customer level utilizing cash from that standpoint christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah and david you asked and then there was a lot packed into that and you mentioned investments and things moving away because weve talked about that in the past and we saw very similar id say its probably a little bit of a larger activities in historical averages on that but the really nice thing about this combination now is we have even more options that are available and so all of the clients arent looking to immediately move into a treasury bill or something of that nature with the insured cash that sweeps and the deposit promos that we have weve got our bankers have multiple tools available for them based on what the clients needs are and i think that just gives us maximum flexibility to solve the issue that they have david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc that makes sense maybe touching on the growth the loan growth side obviously the markets pretty volatile right now but im curious how demands trending from your standpoint how new loan yields are what segments youre still seeing good riskadjusted return and maybe just you probably have some unique opportunities for growth just given the deal and some bigger targets and opportunities to increase relationships does that maybe support outsized growth in the short run im just curious how you think about organic loan growth opportunities torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc david this is tory nixon i think you kind of summarized a lot of things in that question i think theres great opportunity for the company to go forward and to do a lot of what you just described or just asked i mean i think theres the ability for us to certainly serve markets in all of the states that were in whether its small business whether its in the consumer side whether its in commercial middlemarket banking in the real estate space i mean we just have a lot of capability weve got certainly the opportunity as a combined company to increase hold levels and continue to expand credit facilities for customers our customers as they grow i think thats a great opportunity for the bank i mean we have a leasing capability for the organization that i think will be very is being very well received by our ci customers that typically wasnt available in the legacy columbia portfolio of customers so great opportunity to kind of see us be have a lot of financial strength and to be very active in all the markets that we are in and im excited about the ability to grow loans pipeline looks strong its actually just up a little bit from last quarter which is nice to see demand in the marketplace is certainly not the same as it was six to nine months ago but there still is demand and i think to clints point earlier weve got a great opportunity to take market share in all the markets that we are in columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then just kind of in that question too how are new loan yields and in what segments are you still expecting to kind of drive that growth and give good riskadjusted returns torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah i think it certainly depends on the asset class but i think theyre in the theyre near the range on yields maybe a little higher and i mean just weve got a lot of dry powder a lot of opportunity and able to serve our customers and bring in new ones into the company david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then you guys have done a great job continuing to expand at both columbia and umpqua with new hires and new markets and youve already touched on utah i guess as you look at your footprint and thinking about new hiring opportunities and the future of the bank is this a time to be greedy and ph tick off new talent just given the volatility are you looking at new hires and if you are is it primarily deepening existing footprint i mean you talked about continuing to invest in the franchise but are you considering further market expansion torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc so this is tory again ill talk about commercial and let chris talk about consumer of it were doing all of those things so were looking to hire in the markets the new markets that weve expanded into arizona colorado and utah recently were looking to hire some really talented folks in those markets we have hired talent we have recently hired talent in those markets we will continue to do that and then ph infill and the rest of the company i mean we continue to look at talented people and have a philosophy that were going to bring talent into this company when we find it and weve got a great story to tell there that you can obviously tell were very excited about the future of this company and when we think about the opportunity that we have and the opportunity that bankers in our markets have working here they get very excited so we continue to tell the story we continue to hire people in the pacific northwest in northern california in southern california in idaho i mean you name it were continuing to broaden and expand and push the bank forward christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah and david what id add to that is the states where we have the commercial presence were certainly looking at bringing on the retail as i mentioned well bring on small business to fill in where those loan production offices have historically been and what i would say is that were also though looking at the wealth side of it and bringing that into the eight states and the areas that were expanding as well and i think weve both companies have always been opportunistic that when good bankers raise their hands were ready for them and so i would say thats still out there i echo torys comments about people are excited and when you think about the capabilities that we have and the balance sheet construction as ron described i think theres going to be plenty of opportunity for that columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc yeah thank you appreciate it and congrats on closing the deal clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks david operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open mr mcgratty your line is open one moment please yes one moment our next question comes from the line of jared shaw of wells fargo your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good afternoon ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good afternoon jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey maybe just staying on the track of opportunity clearly theres been a lot of disruption with silicon valley and first republic and just in general some banks that are seeing more weakness maybe more specifically do you see specific opportunities in some of those business areas some of those markets to step in and im not sure when you talk about new commercial customers coming to approach you any of that from some of those specialty business lines that some of those banks focus on that could be an opportunity for you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah jared this is clint ill kick it off and then see if tory and chris want to add anything to it the short answer is yes we have seen opportunities we saw that actually in the days and hours leading up to silicon valleys failure weve got a pretty diverse offering and we talk about our portfolio and you look in the slide deck and you can see both sides of the balance sheet theres a lot of granularity and diversification and so with that we have a lot of very experienced bankers and we wont do something if we dont have expertise in it but there is some crossover and to the extent that theres crossover theres well compete for the business and i think we compete very well and it will create opportunities but in terms of going all in and shifting our focus thats not necessarily the plan we love the diversification that we have we think thats a foundational element of strength for our company but certainly well be opportunistic when and where we can be tory anything to add torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no i think youve summarized it really well i mean theres and i think theres that the opportunity exists in all of our markets and were going to stay to do what we do what weve historically done and do it exceptionally columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 well and continue to find customers or people customers who want to be part of the bank or people who want to be part of the bank jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay good thanks and then maybe shifting a little bit on capital you highlight getting back to that cet1 target of do you think is that sufficient going forward is high enough or do you think that maybe you end up needing to bring that floor up a little bit before really exploring other capital deployment opportunities ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah chris this is ron id say our longterm target on cet1 is and were at so well be there next month id say in the total riskbased capital ratio longterm again target is around and i expect well get there over the course of the year again through that earnings and accretion the capital accretion those coming off the financial benefit of both companies coming together ph cutting the costs of having no accretion so thats really you got to look across all four ratios both at the parent and the bank and so yeah by default then that cet1 would be above but longterm target wise not significantly jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so you dont feel a need to change that or raise that in light of sort of the turmoil that weve seen in the last month ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc in terms of longterm targets no theres times where you might want to be below or above depending on which way the winds blow and i said were going to have quite a bit of capital generation over time and again so much of the mark i mean million of the billion in march was rate related like on the bonds thats for the vast majority of that is backed by government to government entities so its interesting for you to think about the impact of the merger accounting on this reducing our capital ratio today but then accreting back over time id say to cet1 thats a measure i know a lot of analysts and investors focus on dont forget to look at the other ph issues as well though i mean in total riskbased capital generally between the bank of the parent is where im targeting to be around over time is a sweet spot clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc and i think the history of premerger both companies that was always a challenge trying to get walk it back down to those longterm targets and you add in the accretion income as well as the earnings power after we get the full cost synergies baked in its thats still i think the primary challenge for us is in the coming years is how do we keep those capital ratios from getting too far north of those targets and you can pick any ratio theyre all going to grow pretty rapidly jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 okay and then just finally from me when we look at the average earning asset guide where do you see cash going back down to a i guess where do you see cash going as a percentage of the balance sheet after we get through the end of march here ph back down to below ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah and on that guide we make in the note column there we assume we maintain a elevated level of cash of course a lot of ph ask me subject to what happens from a macro standpoint with overall deposit flows et cetera so but id say all else being equal if we brought on billion of additional off balance sheet liquidity on balance sheet just to have it on balance sheet and were sitting at ph and wed be somewhere in the billion to billion range if we had not done that so thats probably a better representation of ph well not expect that in spring cash flow for the floor at clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah id just add we had flexibility and we decided that it was appropriate to use that flexibility and just keep a little more cash on the balance sheet during the near term jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah totally understand okay thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of matthew clark of piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon the first one from me just around the borrowings of billion of borrowings and ph then billion of it was for fund cash but i guess whats your what are your thoughts on how borrowings might trend for the balance of the year and whether you might use securities to sell securities to pay them down ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah ideally were going to see our deposit activities strengthen over the course of the next couple of quarters post consolidation as you heard sorry post conversion as you heard chris and clint talk about earlier so no plans to reduce the investment portfolio thats very well structured thats going to provide a lot of value over time and that discount will ph increase if we keep those now discounted bonds on the books so plan on maintaining the wholesale borrowings but then thatll fluctuate just as the opposite of what we see with the net loan deposit flows so in near term relatively static matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 okay great and then youve had a lot of time with how long the merger took to close to identify the cost saves make sure you can get million out theyre coming out sooner than previously thought but are there it may not necessarily be the focus in the near term but have you been able to quantify some additional cost saves above and beyond that million and whether or not if so how much and could that hit the bottom line clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah matt this is clint we have spoken over the past year that our internal target is is actually above million and if we seem overly confident in delivering on million by the end of the third quarter its because we have in fact identified up to that internal target what we havent done is we havent disclosed what that internal number is and theres a couple of reasons one with inflation and wage pressure thats happened over the past yearandahalf since we set that target we wanted to maintain flexibility and then the other component of that is is the investment in growing our franchise that chris and tory spoke about so we wanted to make sure that were still going to do those things were still going to make the appropriate investments but netnet we want to make sure that that doesnt dilute million or cost saves that we promise to investors so there is higher internal target its identified itll trickle in fourth quarter and beyond it could be diluted somewhat by other investments that we may elect to make well talk about those at the time that they occur but then the other aspect of we put two pretty large banks together and i think we did a really good job as a team of setting the org structure for a 50plus billion dollar bank but we also know that theres probably areas where were not probably we know there are areas where yeah were a little heavy in terms of people or redundancy and i think thats a longer term process of just fine tuning and making our company the best and most efficient it can be and so thats the type of activities that youll see in and then ongoing as we go through the years matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just around the deposit pricing outlook it sounds like youre doing some promotional activities in some of your newer markets but can you talk through the deposit pricing philosophy now that you guys are together i mean legacy ph colby wasnt very promotional when it came to deposits but obviously with the combined entity that may have changed a little bit and the turmoil in march may have also changed your view on pricing maybe going forward just any comments around deposit pricing outlook and in particular when the fed stops raising rates clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure matt great question and i would say that separately we actually were very similar in our approaches to exception pricing and in doing things of that nature coming together yeah were still on the same track that we do have as some promo rates that are out there thats not just new markets its existing markets its all across the footprint and so that kind of sets the that sets a marker for us but were still negotiating rates with clients and looking at options looking at where whats the real need what are they really trying to do with the money and so as i mentioned previously lots of different ways to go about that the fed and in the slowing i think thats going to maybe youll see some lag and i think deposit rates tend to lag that and thats historically for both companies as well so as it approaches the slowing i think that yeah you start columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 maybe getting near the peak of it but then ill always throw in the caveat of we dont know what competitors are going to do and so we just have to maintain our discipline we have to stay in touch with our clients and understand whats going on in the market and then tory if you want to add anything torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah matt the only i would add is that with all the conversations that were having with clients which is a lot which has been great the conversation is less about price and more about security and safety certainly theres some price in the conversation but a lot of its around security and safety and explain the balance sheet of the company and our earnings stream and our deposit base et cetera its like very valuable to the customer our customer base and then we had as chris i think talked about in his comments we have a couple products that are really valuable to kind of take money and create incredible safety and security around it through our ics product procedures and so weve done that on a lot the last couple months i think we probably increased the ics bounces about million to million which is just reciprocal insurance for deposits especially on the commercial side so i mean weve got a lot of options for customers and had a lot of conversations and again its a little less about price and more about a relationship and about safety and security matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks and last one for me just housekeeping tax rate what do you suggest we use going forward ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of andrew terrell of stephens your line is open andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc clarification on the margin guidance i think you noted the margin was on a gaap basis in march i think the borrowings were about the access cash and borrowings are up basis points to that in your full year margin guidance that to what do you assume for borrowing and cash can you assume it stays at a relatively similar level ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah we assume a consistent level and also recognize that that full year number will also reflect the effect of averages with the combination fully included for of those months but not the full so maintain consistent cash balances and then id clarify one item so when we talked about the impact of the excess liquidity i was really referring to the month of march at the ph would have been ballpark having not brought on that excess borrowing but ph insignificant impact in terms of net interest income but bps on the margin andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc yeah got it understood okay and on the core fee income side it looks like when i adjust the items called out that the core operating fee income was around million or so for the quarter i guess given theres several moving parts here can you help us out just expectations for kind of a core fee income run rate moving forward ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah we didnt provide a guide on that but i can tell you for the month of march net interest income excluding again the fair value change type stuff was million just for the month on a combined basis andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay so ph implied yeah okay that makes sense ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc and last one from me is just on the office i appreciate all the color here on page of the presentation a couple of questions for the six properties that are listed as greater than million what markets are those in and can you talk about the underwriting specifically on the larger end of the spectrum and whether it differs at all from what you list as the kind of averages there and then the second part was the credit mark taken on acquired office portfolio is that similar to the overall credit mark in a transaction or did the deal allow you to put a greater kind of mark against the office book columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah this is frank chief credit officer regarding the first part of your question the majority of those in the larger tranche are really centered in the puget sound area if you will and the underwriting is very similar but the qualification criteria i would say is much more steep so weve got to know the sponsors extremely well theyve got to sensitize extremely well we shock it for rate we shock it for vacancy even to a greater degree of some of our smaller relationship deals that we evaluate so they are all leased at this point i will say fully leased under lease agreements and are performing well andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay and then on the credit mark on the office portfolio specifically was it similar to just the overall market was there a bifurcation i guess did the deal allow you to put a larger credit mark on the office book a 05dwxve ron farnsworth but we have the ability to do if the data supports it but again we talked about the quality of this portfolio id say its ballpark in average in line with the overall cre level andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for taking the questions and congrats on closing the deal clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc you bet thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thanks andrew operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of brody preston your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good evening everyone or good afternoon for you all thank you for taking the questions just wanted to ask on the securities that you sold and then the securities that you purchased at the end of march what was the duration of those securities and what was the rate on the billion that you sold i guess more the effective rate for the marks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah this is ron id say so again we sold off ph frontended cash flows so the duration on the purchases was probably about a half year longer than the overall duration again we wanted to extend that so we would have been probably around ended up at just with the effect of the repurchases were longer dated right so and and again with an eye towards when we did this it was actually the first week of march columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 right so you had a top tick in the bond yield february in that first week and it wasnt for another week a week and a half or so following that you saw the rally in the bond markets and the yields decline so overall the mark book was now you talked about the ones sold were probably a bit below the ones purchased were a bit above just given the slight difference in duration brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and then on the nim guide the core nim guide that you have i just wanted to ask you outlined what your rate expectations are but i wanted to ask what the interestbearing beta and the nib mix assumptions are that underpin that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet itll be a continued well be talking about later in the interest rate sensitivity slides working up closer to that model beta from our sensitivity standpoint so higher than but probably but not at the level we have footnoted on that slide later on so continued increase just because were assuming theres a lag to deposit pricing increases brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and is there a static deposit mix assumption that underpins the nim guidance ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc its relatively static granted and we talked about earlier for example dda are up here in december sorry here in april but just in terms of the overall mix not a significant change in the overall mix brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then on the i guess on the margin waterfall chart that you have in there the 43basispoint drag that you have for deposits do you have a sense for how much of that was mix versus rate ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc well i think in terms of this waterfall youve also got the effect of the  reported amount was standalone umpqua holdings the  reported amount was combined company for one month and then standalone prior umpqua holdings for the first two months of the quarter so youve got that really drive a good chunk of that from an overall mix standpoint indiscernible brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay understood columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc itll make a lot more sense for you next quarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yeah i wanted to ask on the loans that are maturing in the less than six months bucket the fixed the billion do you have a sense for what the current yield is on those loans versus what current origination yields are torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc i dont know less ph anyway ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc ph with current yield ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc ph yeah ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc those loans are going to be dated from prior to the move up so its going to be in the call it mid to range at the highest which is going to be well below what tory talked about earlier for new loan yields brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and do you all have any hedges in place on the loan portfolio that we need to think about for nii modeling ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc not on the balance sheet we do have customer swaps but those are offsetting backtoback on our balance sheet weve taken the approach of using instruments within the portfolio specifically here in this case were talking about the bond portfolio along with the use of shortterm borrowings to really help improve our interest rate sensitivity position we talked about earlier columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then just one last one for me im sorry if you mentioned this earlier and i missed it but just on the finpac portfolio i wanted to ask two questions what is the growth outlook for that portfolio going forward i know its a much smaller piece of the overall loan portfolio now and then the annualized chargeoff ratio i know its tough to say but could you help us think about what a peak net chargeoff ratio kind of looks like through cycle for that loan book torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc this is tory ill talk about the growth side and then frank can weigh in if he wants on the chargeoff piece i mean the first of all the finpac portfolio is three different businesses its a small ticket which makes up about half of it and then we have a vendor space and a traditional commercial bank leasing business for our customers each of those are about of the portfolio the growth outlook for the combined finpac portfolio is somewhere between million and million over the course of and thats evenly distributed within those three businesses so moving up a little but nothing significant at all frank do you want to talk about frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah generally what we find within the finpac portfolio we look at the nonaccrual numbers and how those are tracking and generally of the preceding quarter approximately of those nonaccruals typically roll the chargeoff i think that the top of it will be north of and i would be surprised if it peaks over brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very helpful and i guess just if i could sneak one followup on that do you view the finpac portfolio as i guess when you look across the rest of the equivalent finance kind of space do you view it as different from a mix and the type of stuff that youre underwriting relative to what other banks underwrite or do you think its fairly similar to the equipment loans that other banks are also underwriting frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc its different with respect to the classic finpac these are tiny ticket loans theyre higher yielding theyre higher risk specialized lending so thats why you see the loss numbers where theyre at and thats why were not surprised typically when you say equipment finance company most equipment finance companies do not have a tiny ticket small ticket leasing operation theyre typically middle market which we also have and those losses are extremely low if existent at all but its also extremely lowyielding business as well so it is more of a specialized leasing business torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yes this is tory indiscernible columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats very helpful thank you very much for taking my questions everyone i appreciate it operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of brandon king of truist your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc just one question for me and i know a lot has changed since the merger was announced but with the return on tangible common equity of it was kind of the estimation nim but should we think about that as a longterm target for the company now ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc well i say this we did also include on page of this kind of our updated expectations as compared to the original announcement date and with that just in terms of return on tangible common equity driven again by a lot of the accretion is now 20plus so i guess it depends on long term and the definition of long term for that for the next couple years we feel pretty good about that longerterm beyond that i think just going back over 27year career not specific to columbia but just for regional banks in general somewhere in the midteens seem to make sense for longterm targets brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay no that is all i had clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah thank you indiscernible brandon king q analyst truist securities inc my questions columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc your line is open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good afternoon everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey jon indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just hey just a few followups just focusing out a bit on credit i understand the moodys impact on the provision but credit seems clean you have high reserves and marks is it safe for us to assume just minimal provisions from here or what would drive your provision from here ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc this is ron what id say what would drive the provision of course will be changes in the economic forecasts right so as those change youll see from a cecl standpoint provisions but the real key is whats happening with chargeoffs and so weve seen elevated levels with finpac over the last couple quarters specific to that small owneroperator transportation type business that will continue here for a bit and were just were not seeing any migration for the rest of the portfolio which is the vast majority of the portfolio so i think specific provisions its going to be solely based off of what we see with the moodys baseline economic forecast or consensus economic forecast over time how they change jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats good thats helpful just one followup on office that last bullet where you give some of the stats in terms of what youve seen in that portfolio is any of that abnormal in your minds the central business district and suburban office that youre talking about are any of those stats different from what you normally see clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc no theyre not pretty typical as to what i would have expected to see jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then i guess the other one slide i want to make sure i have this right the earning asset message ron when i just do the math it suggests that  and  average earning assets are going to look a lot like  is that the right way to read that i know it sounds like a simple question but i just want to clarify that columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc that is jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay and then last one clint for you are the name changes done and just big picture how did the conversion go thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc the name changes are done the reason i hesitate is so like if you drive by the like a legacy a former columbia bank branch most of those are signs are bagged right now because theres locations that we have to resign and then even in markets like the puget sound area where we both had or portland where we both separately had a significant presence well we want to make sure that the branding in that market and any particular matches we dont want to mismatch signs and things so thats a summertime project but when you do drive by one of the locations that formerly said columbia bank it now says umpqua bank our branch thats in the first floor of our headquarters building here has been fully rebranded was done i think the first week so that side of it i think has gone very well what ill say about the conversion when ron was talking about the bond portfolio during his prepared remarks he could hardly contain his excitement and even right now i just mentioned bond portfolio and hes really ear to ear thats kind of how im not an excitable person but thats how when i think about the team that we have assembled with this combination and i referenced it in my prepared remarks and this has been a pretty lengthy call so i dont know if anybody even remembers an hour and minutes ago when i made these comments but if you think about what we accomplished organizationally in the first quarter two separate divestiture projects i mean those are kind of mini ma transactions in and of themselves closing a transformative merger midquarter and then having this level of detail already to go and along the way two and a half weeks after you close it you convert the systems and so i think about the talent that it took to pull that off and we did it and so i think about myself as an employee of the company im utilizing all our current goforward platforms its working great itd be disingenuous if i didnt say that the first day after my email converted that i wasnt like trying to figure out where the heck everything was but by the third day man i was loving the enhanced functionality that we have and then if i step back and think of it from a customers perspective on a personal level utilizing all of our goforward platforms and theyre working great and more importantly when i go home at night my wifes not complaining about zelle or the mobile banking app or anything like that so just a couple of kind of highlevel points of view that weve monitored and then weve had a lot of conversations with some of our very complex larger middle market clients and just a lot of success stories so i think i was telling somebody this the other day our imo team they gave themselves in aminus i give them a solid a maybe even an aplus now that doesnt mean there still arent just some things that are in flight but overall it went great and thats why theres the optimism around the pipelines building the outlook for the rest of the year the ability to go out take market share and all of those things that weve talked about for the last hour and minutes columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 26apr2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thats helpful and thanks for the great deck a lot of good detail on there i appreciate it clint e stein a president chief executive officer director
