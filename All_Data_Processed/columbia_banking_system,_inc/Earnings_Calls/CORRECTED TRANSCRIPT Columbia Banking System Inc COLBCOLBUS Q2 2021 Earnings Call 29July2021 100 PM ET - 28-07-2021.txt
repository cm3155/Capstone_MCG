statements during the call for further information on forwardlooking comments please refer to either our earnings release our website or our sec filings this time ill turn the call over to aaron aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you clint and good morning everyone during the quarter columbia generated net income of million or per share adjusted for of acquisitionrelated costs pretax preprovision income of million was one of our best quarters on record this strong performance was driven by solid fundamentals earning assets increased our cost of deposits remained among the best in the industry and noninterest income was again a solid contributor total deposits increased by million or annualized during the quarter to billion at june our cost of deposits held steady at just basis points total loans increased modestly to billion at june net of ppp our loan balance has increased by million or annualized and surpassed billion for the first time in our history the increase was driven by record production during the quarter we originated million of new loans which includes million of ppp loans new loan production excluding ppp was brought on at an average taxadjusted coupon rate of which compares to the overall portfolio rate also excluding ppp of our investment securities portfolio was billion as of june which was a linked quarter increase of million driven by million of purchases during the quarter we transferred securities with a fair value of billion from the availableforsale classification to the heldtomaturity classification because the intent was to hold these investments to maturity the securities are no longer subject to valuation adjustments connected to interest rate changes and that should reduce the related volatility in equity and book value the net interest margin decreased basis points linked quarter to while our net interest income increased by million linked quarter as we deployed more of our deposit growth into loans and investment securities the deposit inflows and larger investment portfolio were key factors behind the margin pressure in the quarter as higher securities balances and lower yields on those balances together contributed basis points to the margin decline the remaining decline is primarily due to a reduction in loan yields mostly due to a drop in amortized fees from the ppp portfolio but also from lower coupon rates on new loans noninterest income was down slightly on a linkedquarter basis to million the drop was centered in loan revenue stemming from lower mortgage banking income but most of that pressure ph was also by strength in other business lines notably card revenues mostly driven by interchange fees increased by million while financial services and trust revenue rose by and deposit and treasury management fees increased by noninterest expense of million included professional services cost of columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 related to the pending merchants bank of commerce transaction excluding these acquisition costs noninterest expense of million was essentially flat when compared to the first quarter compensation and benefit costs increased in the quarter mostly due to higher capitalized loan origination costs in the first quarter when compared to the second quarter that said even in the second quarter we continued to benefit from a high level of capitalized loan origination expense meanwhile the other expense line decreased linked quarter due to million of less provision for unfunded commitments lastly the provision for income taxes increased million on a linkedquarter basis to million representing a effective rate we continue to expect our tax rate to remain in the range of to with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron and good morning everyone throughout the economic turbulence of the past months we have focused on what we can control in order to take care of our employees clients and communities we continue to invest in our people relationship training and banking systems our bankers have responded by keeping the pipeline full and providing custom solutions to meet the needs of existing and new clients following this businessasusual mindset positioned us to capitalize on highquality credits and win new business during the quarter while still in the background during the second quarter the pandemic is no longer the lead story the bank continued to originate ppp loans through the programs end on may and in the final tally for both rounds of ppp approximately loans were originated which infused over billion into the pacific northwest economy forgiveness for both rounds is now underway as the round platform opened for our clients on july net of unearned income ppp loans were million at the end of the second quarter we have received over million of payoffs and paydowns related to round of the program and we have received over applications for forgiveness of round loans since the portal opened as clint noted excluding round ppp loans we achieved a new loan production record of million which was notably higher than the prior quarter record of million set during the fourth quarter of production was especially strong in cre and ci was diversified with good growth in real estate lending and leasing healthcare construction and the agriculture sectors line utilization was flat at but we saw absolute dollar increases in ci and construction lines excluding ppp the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the composition of the loan portfolio remained relatively unchanged and the overall portfolio mix is now ppp loans non ppp fixed floating and variable as was mentioned deposits grew by million during the quarter and by over billion over the past months the quarterly inflows were split between noninterest and interest bearing with the majority from business customers over half of the increase is from new accounts with the remainder attributed to delayed spending and investment by existing business clients and consumers approximately of the quarterly increase came from our puget sound region with approximately from oregon and the columbia gorge clients the deposit mix increased slightly to business and consumer we continue to drive exception rates down maintaining our industryleading cost of deposits although residential mortgage activity slowed on a linkedquarter basis other fee income categories were up during the quarter as we benefit from our relationship focus and higher quality referrals cb financial services and columbia trust company have both had a tremendous year achieving record revenues in assets under management card revenues was up million on a linkedquarter basis and deposit service fees increased by columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 as part of our ongoing branch rationalization process we recently announced the consolidation of three branches scheduled to occur during september and october of this year we are continually optimizing our delivery strategy and have been proactive in consolidating branches over the past decade expanding each branch of service coverage area given local market conditions and projected growth continuing to expand our delivery strategy on july we relocated our tigard oregon branch and opened a new financial hub it joins our ballard and boise neighborhubs which are specifically designed to support a relationshipbased approach to helping our clients achieve their financial goals now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you chris this quarters allowance for credit losses totaled million a reduction of million from last quarter net recoveries of about led to a provision release of million for the quarter it should also be noted that the release from the provision was muted by over million in loan growth net of ppp during the quarter our ihs market economic forecast assumes fullyear gdp growth of for and for with the unemployment rate predicted to end at and in close to prepandemic levels this forecast is an improvement over last quarter when gdp was forecasted at for the improved forecast is counterbalanced by the continued stress in our loan portfolio as borrowers continue to be impacted by the lingering effects of the pandemic and related lockdowns as such we continue to apply an overlay for what we consider highrisk commercial real estate and downstream potential impacts of permanent job losses at a significant northwest employer these amounted to a combined million in  reserves a decrease from million in  our adjustment is driven by the continuing impacts of the pandemic affecting hospitality shifting dynamics in office and retail and business closures and labor challenges in the restaurant industry we ended the quarter with an allowance relative to periodend loans of adjusting for ppp loans the allowance to periodend loans increases to npas for the quarter improved to basis points the decline in npas is principally due to paydowns and payoffs with a modest amount returning to accrual status most of our remaining npas are assets that have gained to this classification due to reasons not related to the pandemic however with that said the pandemic has in some cases impacted the business ability to rebound nevertheless at basis points npas are very manageable at this point past due loans for the quarter were basis points compared to basis points last quarter net chargeoffs as noted earlier posted a small recovery of about problem loans which we define as loans rated watch or worse declined from million last quarter to million as of june when compared to a year ago when problem loans were about billion you can see there has been a meaningful amount of healing within the portfolio this is principally within the hospitality transportation food and beverage and retail portfolios okay deferrals at the close of the quarter we had million in active deferrals or less than of our portfolio excluding ppp loans this is of course very different from this time last year when we had billion the majority of these deferrals are roughly are on their first deferral it can be found in our hospitality and columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 restaurant portfolios along with some ph urban parking lots deferrals for the most part continue to run off as expected we continue to classify our retail hospitality restaurant and aviation portfolios as portfolio subject to an elevated level of risk due to the pandemic in aggregate these portfolios account for about billion in loans or of our loan portfolio retail is the largest segment at million in loans outstanding at the end of the quarter while we remain concerned over the pandemics impact on this portfolio problem loans are actually down year overyear as well as from last quarter in fact this portfolio has now exhibited improving credit trends for four consecutive quarters and problem loans are half of what they were a year ago we had no past dues in this segment nonaccruals were only basis points and no retail loans were on deferral as of june as mentioned before ppp loans have certainly made a difference for our borrowers in this portfolio while these statistics are all positive we continue to be cautious here given the colloquial evidence we see in our footprint along with conditions seen in the labor markets hospitality at million has shown a mixed bag of results in total problem loans in this segment declined during the quarter and now represent about of the portfolio down from a year ago as discussed last quarter there is clearly a bifurcation in the portfolio between leisureoriented and business oriented properties leisure accounts for about of our portfolio while business accounts for leisure properties have weathered the pandemic much better than our original expectations while businessoriented properties which make up most of the substandard assets in this portfolio are taking longer to recover about half of hospitalitys portfolios million of problem loans are substandard or roughly million it does appear that this level of classification in substandard hospitality loans has leveled off for most of these hotel properties rated substandard we have put into place longterm action plans to help get our customers through to recovery restaurants which account for about million remained consistent this past quarter problem loans were stable at roughly of the portfolio we had about million in deferrals in this portfolio at quarter end similar to the bank in general deferrals this time last year amounted to million so a dramatic reduction year overyear again ppp loans have had a meaningful impact for restaurant operators as of june 30th of our restaurant operators were cleared to open at occupancy which of course is great news however the new issue affecting these operators is finding enough employees to support occupancy so its a good newsbad news scenario for restaurant operators finally the aviation portfolio had roughly million down by about million from a year ago was stable during the quarter as in past quarters no loans were past due all customers continue to pay as agreed and no loans were on deferral this industry will take time to recover mostly due to business travel which as of yet has not rebounded as dramatically as leisure travel there is a lot of pentup demand on the leisure side as seen by the tsa traffic with july traffic averaging indiscernible levels grandparents are excited to go visit their grandchildren and many families are finally taking that long awaited trip to hawaii however headwinds continue with low demand for business travel as noted before and an unequal global recovery despite the slow recovery due to these continued headwinds many us airlines are projecting a return to positive cash flow within the next few quarters and have begun using their liquidity to retire debt and deleverage their balance sheets i will now hand the call back over to clint columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc

columbia counterparts to ensure a seamless closing and integration of the merger the partnership will bring together two communityfocused banks with complementary business models and cultures this morning we announced our regular quarterly dividend of this quarters dividend will be paid on august to shareholders of record as of the close of business on august this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now raquel we will open the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of matthew clark with piper sandler matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co very strong production this quarter and wanted to get a better sense of the type of commercial real estate production that youre doing assuming that retail office hospitality are still areas of some concern in terms of new business just want to get a sense for what drove that commercial real estate piece of production clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah just a sec let me get it in front of me i have too much paper so while andy finds the detailed map ill just speak in general in terms of the record production for the quarter and as i noted in my opening comments it was far surpassed the record previous record set in the fourth quarter of last year and so thats just a continuation of what we saw at the end of the third quarter of last year going into the fourth quarter and that momentum continued to build in terms of pipeline activity and what were seeing just broadly is even though theres a lot of liquidity still out there in the market its a very competitive atmosphere were taking market share ph in some longtime clients and thats what you saw that really drove that record production during the quarter i think andy has the detail that will respond to your question columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah so most of the growth is actually an owneroccupied cre and its a combination of owneroccupied office warehouse and warehousetype properties and then weve also done a little bit in the retail space but thats pretty modest at million so its predominantly owneroccupied matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then how does the pipeline compare to last quarter coming out of given the production is it pipeline is it down and you feel like you need to kind of backfill or im just trying to get a sense for the change on a percentage basis from last quarter or even yearoveryear christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc sure matt and as expected you would expect that after a record quarter at those levels that the pipeline would pull back some were very pleased with where its at and our bankers continue to prospect win new deals and were holding on to a lot of our existing loans on the books as well so yeah its retreated a little but in historic if you look at it historically were very pleased at the level that its at and it should lead to growth for us matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the new coupons at ph thats down pretty materially from last quarter i think at ph exppp i guess how much of that was related to the mix and then how much of that might be related to just be more competitive on price christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah ill take a start on that and then aaron can comment on maybe some more details it does have to do mostly with the mix during the quarter we had the opportunity to participate in some municipal deals that drove some larger balances those are highly competitive rfps our approach our expertise in that space allowed us to win those deals but those highquality credits certainly come along at a lower coupon and that skewed the number for the quarter and i think past that we see a more of a return to leveled out numbers and improving numbers and aaron is there anything youd like to add aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc id just add in matt that the loan yields during the quarter excluding ppp was ph and that compares to in the first quarter matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay and then just on i know its a small piece of the revenue pie but on the mortgage the weaker mortgage gain on sale and i think its embedded in your loan revenue fee line can you give us a sense for how much in the way of loans were sold in the specific gain this quarter versus last columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc so matt im not sure were going to provide the specifics on that but generally speaking the volume of sales as well as the gain on sale is not materially different from quartertoquarter what changed was the pipeline and the value of the pipeline so that was really what drove the decline sequentially so its more of the volume of activity in the business versus the gain on sale amount that drove the change matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co question on the just trying to ball together the margin and your securities investments i guess if you could kind of offer any thoughts on goforward what you think youd do with that earning asset balance as well as kind of stabilizing the margin and i know the goal is ph spread income  but just the interplay and anything you could kind of point to what you think back half thanks aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc the margin is going to continue to be a bit of a challenge i mean theres a lot of factors at play as you noted we have had a very significant increase in investment securities balances during the quarter and the balances that did come on came on at lower yields ultimately to see that the margin kind of rebound is going to take either improvements in the rate environments or a significant shift back toward loans so i think over the next couple of quarters youre going to have the noise of ppp continuing to add that we still have million of ppp loans on the balance sheet my expectation as i said much of that will be forgiven over this quarter and next and so that will continue to drive some of the fee income on that and benefit the margin underlying that youre going to see the full quarter impacts of the changes that i just discussed with respect to the securities portfolio and lower yields on both the securities as well as on the loan portfolio so theres going to be some fundamental pressure there that continues that said i do think that were getting closer to where i would expect that to bottom out and obviously im very hopeful that we get some improvement in the rate environment the rates this quarter were not ideal not only did we see the ph 10year come in quite a bit but the flattening was not ideal columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 encouragingly though some of the more recent forecasts that ive seen for rates are more suggestive that we could see a good lift by the end of the year so hopefully the operating environment in terms of rates show some improvement from here and then with the worst of the kind of balance sheet pressures kind of working through the system my expectation is that the core margin is closer to a bottoming than not but we probably still have a little further to go clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc and ill just add on to that that to me the wildcard around the margin is what happens with deposit growth and thats really created the liquidity and the shift into i guess the earning asset mix shift and as you know jeff from all the years you followed us that in a normal environment virtually all of our deposit growth comes in the second half of the year and we had another billion in the first half of this year of deposit growth so it certainly impacts the margin calculation and i know thats an important component of your modeling but were still at basis points for cost of funds and so where im really focused and the team is really focused is making sure that were growing net interest income and i think that if we should continue to have strong deposit growth while well push the loantodeposit ratio down and perhaps grow in the shortterm the size of the securities book it should result in increased revenue for us jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay i appreciate the commentary maybe one other just a different angle on the expense line you kind of noted some of the ppp impact there but thats a pretty low number you guys had talked about a mid to upper kind of run rate can we adjust that lower is it squarely kind of mid if we came in a bit im just trying to sense if thats come in or if theres significant investment in the second half we should look for aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah jeff i guess im just inclined to guide you lower at this point that said i commend the team for doing a great job controlling expenses and as chris noted were going to be doing a little bit consolidation here in the back half thatll help some but the ph fas91 in the second quarter were still pretty strong theres probably a couple million of that and i would expect that thats going to have much less of a beneficial impact on our expenses in the third quarter and then weve also got some project costs that im expecting are probably going to hit our data processing and software line in the third quarter so at this point i think that the prior guidance still stands particularly as were seeing a lot more of our folks get out and while theyve been active with clients throughout i think were starting to see a little bit more travel and entertainment kind of expenses and so thats going to probably ph push that up too but were certainly being very mindful of holding those costs in check jeffrey allen rulis q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jackie bohlen with kbw your line is open columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc sorry i unmute myself hi everyone a hi jackie jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so im going to give you a little bit of context for where my question is coming from so i apologize if this is a little bit wordy but i want to make sure i make it clear what im asking this is one of the one of the ph lesser quarters that ive had and looking through other earnings releases i really think that ive been asking the wrong question and so i have the opportunity to actually ask the right one which is i feel like ive been really focused on line utilization when what i should be focused on is actual line draws and you had if i did my math right excluding ppp you had balanced growth in the commercial business portfolio and so i want to see where thats coming from if you have a sense whether its from customers that are actually out there and spending more or whether its some of the new generation that you were talking about and just kind of how you think of the momentum going forward clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thats absolutely the right way to think about it because especially if youre looking at yearoveryear or even on linkedquarter as our bankers are out there originating new commitments and new balances on those commitments that it can skew that utilization ratio im looking at the line utilization number itself does not change from quartertoquarter but youre right to be thinking about the draws have increased just as the commitments have increased jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i think yeah i mean you have some context for that change because i think what youre really trying to figure out is how much of those roughly million of growth came from growth in new outstanding lines jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes just wondering my thesis and i dont know if this is going to play out or not is that though were not seeing line utilization change thats because youre adding new customers which is drawing the commitment level up and so its masking the benefit of some of the drawers that you are seeing does that sound fair christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 jackie i think thats a fair question and apologize for not having that right at the tip of our fingers id be happy to talk jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no i know its really a nuance sorry to put you on the spot like that christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no worries well see if in our information here we do have it and you can either get back if you have another question or well get back to you afterwards certainly its a great question jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc and the new balances the new clients that are coming on are certainly transferring line balances and it does mask the overall aspect of it so yeah its an excellent question jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and that i mean your comments right there chris kind of gets to the heart of what im looking at which is more just the general momentum that youre seeing more so than an actual dollar figure and then the second thing i wanted to ask is just related to construction i know demand is high in the market but obviously there are constraints relating to supply chains and just availability of land and inventory and everything and so im wondering what youre seeing in that market in terms of growth potential and how projects are moving along christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah so referring more to our builder banking group theyre having a fantastic year builders are still they have inventory theyre finding projects are delayed and taking longer theyre getting through to the end sales up into the second quarter were very strong i think the biggest challenge for us when you look at that segment is houses are selling so quickly that theyre not staying around on our books so the churn of it is pretty robust now were going to move into a season where house sales tend to slow down and things of that nature may give us a little bit of a lift there but todate its been extremely quick other than the delays from the supply chain jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 and jackie this is aaron i pulled up the sequential change if im understanding your question correctly the sequential increase in revolving lines at the bank increased by about million on a net basis jacquelynne bohlen q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thanks aaron and again i apologize for having such a technical question i was just trying to get a kind of a sense of new customer activity and what impact thats having on utilization rates clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thats a good question operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe just back to the question on deposits youre expecting similar second half deposit growth to maybe what we see historically in other words are you seeing some normalization developing in deposit flows or do we still have some of the accesses out there in the market in terms of money flowing in christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc wow thats a forwardlooking question that id love to have an exact answer for but historically yes youve seen that i think that it remains to be seen and theres still a lot of liquidity in the system weve talked in previous quarters about whats it going to take for that liquidity to exit the system all things being equal i think i cant pinpoint that well be at the same exact levels but there is a lot of economic activity money is changing hands and i would expect that our client base will continue to behave as they have with that said and i think one of the variables could be new client acquisition and what continues to come on in that space which may be an offset to if normal activity is not there we may see a pickup in that which would then offset it so all that around i would say yeah i would think its going to be fairly normal but the components of it may be different jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc i mean theres one other variable that comes into play and thats what we do through our cb financial services group and thats something that as clients begin to maybe look for returns above what were paying on bank deposit rates then we see some activity and weve seen that in prepandemic it was several hundred million dollars bank for a couple of quarters that move off our balance sheet into assets under management with our financial services group so we still drive positive economics from that and you can see some of that activity still occurring today and you see that with that upward trajectory in terms of the fee income that were driving from that group so thats something that as we progress through the third quarter or fourth quarter if thats a significant driver of net deposit balances then well certainly highlight that for you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay that was another question i had so i can scratch it off my list so i appreciate that andy question for you one of your quotes on the release is things are very strong and you appreciate all the puts and takes in terms of the reserve and provision but what does it take what more does it take to keep bringing the reserve down is it economic improvement that does it is it changing of your factors and i guess im just trying to get a bit of a forward look because of some of these negative provisions that weve seen in the last couple of quarters christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc right well for columbia we still have million plus in substandard loans and so we need to continue to work through and help those borrowers recover and that will have a meaningful impact on our level allowance for credit losses i think as the economy stabilizes and we do not see dramatic changes in economic forecasts the economic forecast will be less of a driver and more traditional levels of the problem loans chargeoffs and those kinds of activities will be driving the provision does that answer your question i mean i trying to be i guess a little bit more specific to colb jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah that does help i guess from an outsiders point of view i still see the reserve levels as relatively high particularly relative to your npas so i just kind of wanted to get a flavor for what we should expect in terms of the quarterly impact on the pl andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc okay jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay last question maybe for you clint just on this loan production and growth numbers that youve been seeing it feels like something is different in your model in a positive way and you guys always highlight expenses to average assets and weve touched a little bit on expected deposit growth so that brings up assets columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 as well but im just curious what kind of capacity you feel like you have to add assets without a lot of hiring and spending another way is what kind of leverage do you have in your business model and is it different than a couple of years ago technical difficulty jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc youre still there technical difficulty operator ladies and gentlemen this is the operator please stand by please resume clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc all right jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you hear me clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah jon that was the best answer ive even given unfortunately nobody heard it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i think you put me on mute and started hysterically laughing and you hit disconnect clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well im trying to decide if it was andy or chris that kicked something under the table but anyway jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc did you hear my question clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc i believe so jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc so what do you want to repeat it just to make sure jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc im just curious about the operating leverage in your business because im looking at the loan production is going up and you always highlight the operating leverage piece of the business and im just curious if is the business model a little bit different meaning you have the capacity to add assets without hiring a lot of new lenders and is there the potential for longerterm improvement in operating leverage based on some of the changes you made over the last couple of years clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah the short answer is yes to both of those but its more nuanced in terms of internal capacity and in particular in our ability to handle additional loan volume is something that weve worked on for the past several years and even with the things that weve discussed over the past year where we when we say that our bankers remained externally focused and we continued throughout the pandemic in a nearnormal operating capacity well that also included moving forward on internal initiatives in the back office process improvement increased automation and all of those types of activities as well as just the collaboration amongst our various teams and groups in getting the right banker in front of the client and thats resulted in relationships on both sides of the balance sheet driving activity to columbia trust company as well as cb financial services and thats always been the goal is to have that type of activity and volume to be able to scale our business so we have been working on it and i think that results of our participation in both rounds of the ppp program where we ph put over ppp loans for about billion just demonstrated the capabilities and the progress that weve made on that if you think it wasnt too long ago that well that just ppp alone from a volume standpoint was about double the number of loans that we would typically do in a year and then equate it to what our annual production was just a couple of years ago and so to be able to do that and in the midst of that have two of our top three quarters of production and do it in a very controlled manner it wasnt other than the first part of ppp which was all handsondeck effort everything else was handled in essentially a businessasusual fashion so thats the long winded way of saying yes we can do more with the existing talent and infrastructure that we have but i think its also important to note that theres some disruption thats occurring with some of the large national banks in terms of how they serve their clients and thats creating some dissatisfaction at the client level that were benefiting from but also they have some really good bankers and if we have the opportunity to bring in good bankers well make room on the bus for them jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good its a long game so i appreciate all that and i think it was a good quarter so thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks jon columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of andrew terrell with stephens andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey andrew andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey maybe just to start aaron can you remind us just what the approach youre taking from a duration perspective to investing in the securities portfolio is it seems like you might be buying in a bit longer duration just given where the overall portfolio duration during this quarter aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah ph we dont have to add a little bit further on the curve i dont think were going to extend beyond where weve been buying the overall duration in the portfolio is inched up were now right about five years and as you noted we split the portfolio between an afs and an htm portfolio so theres a little bit of differential between those two the afs is at about and the heldtomaturity is about the new purchases in the quarter were right around so as i said we have ph gone out some but we also have been pretty thoughtful of what were buying so were buying things that have lower likelihood of prepay were buying things that have pretty good upfront cash flows so that to the extent that we are seeing continued strong loan growth we and if deposit flows arent keeping up that we have those cash flows to reinvest into the loan growth so were being really mindful about what were doing and of course you know that we tend to stick with very highquality type of purchases so its a very deliberate process that we go through obviously with the size that the book has gotten to be we need to be very thoughtful about how were managing that and were doing so but i would not expect that youre going to see that portfolio duration extend the maturity from here andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay great thats helpful thank you and apologies for maybe the backtoback kind of technical questions but looking at it based on the slide deck about half of the loan book is variable and another about of that is currently out of floor rate right now just for those loans currently at floor rates how many rate hikes do you think we would need to see before breaking past kind of the average loan floor aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i dont have that offhand but its theyre various its a mix where theres some that are going to lift pretty quickly and theres others that are going to take a little longer so well we actually look at this interquarter and its something that were going to i think start providing some better disclosure for because our hope obviously is that rates are going to be moved ph even higher not lower and so i think we can start providing you with some additional context that will help with that columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc all right great that would be thatd very helpful and yeah lets hope so on the rate side okay thats it for me thanks for taking the questions operator your next question is from the line of matthew clark from piper sandler matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey just had a few followups just to circle the wagons on the depositrelated question kind of a traditional traditionally stronger second half in terms of growth and i assume youre also expecting that million of ppp loans a lot of that likely translates into deposits as well which is just going to cause that phenomenon to continue here in the second half is that fair aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think thats a fair assumption because to qualify for forgiveness if probably theyve already spent the money matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay and then just on the securities purchases can you give us the weighted average rate on what you bought this quarter and yeah thats my second question i guess aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah so that the rate on the new purchases was and which is actually up from the first quarter where were at so despite the drop in rates to the quarter the average purchased indiscernible i was pleased to see that and ph particularly given the volume that we added during the quarter we had about million of purchases and so i my expectation is that we wont be buying in that volume again going forward but that hopefully that answers your questions matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yeah and i guess my the followup part of that question was related to what the curve has done its kind of gone against you and everybody else so i guess what are your thoughts on i guess if you were to buy something today what is that kind of the blended rate on that knowing the volume of what youre going to purchase this coming quarter is going to obviously be lower aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc well i mean we are continuing to purchase i mean its not like were suspending that because were going to have cash flows and things will need to be reinvested but i would say that of the purchases that i have seen as ph waste theyre a little below where the average was in the second quarter but well see what happens through the quarter were still pretty early so i cant tell you directionally whats either going to happen columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 29jul2021 with indiscernible with purchases but at this point i guess were down a little bit from where we were in the second quarter but hopefully that turns matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just finally on the loan purchases i think you had mentioned it earlier on in your comments but i didnt pick i didnt catch it can you give us the amount of loans purchased and what specifically you bought and whats your appetite to do more of that going forward aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc not sure what youre indiscernible we did not make any loan purchases during the quarter matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay i know you did last quarter i just didnt wasnt sure if i heard you did more of it this quarter so i assume no more singlefamily resi purchases aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc we well periodically if it makes sense given paydowns in the portfolio we might do some topping up of that but it is something thats worked on in the second quarter matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator ladies and gentlemen this
