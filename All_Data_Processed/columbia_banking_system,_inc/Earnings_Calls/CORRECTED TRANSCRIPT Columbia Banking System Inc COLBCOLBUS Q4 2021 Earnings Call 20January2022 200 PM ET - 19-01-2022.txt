please refer to either our earnings release our website or our sec filings at this point id like to turn the call over to aaron aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you clint fullyear net income of million and eps of included a full quarter of earnings from our merchants acquisition of approximately million our performance was a reflection of strong growth in loans deposits and fee income combined with prudent spending and strategic investment excluding costs related to the merchants acquisition and encore combination of million pretax preprovision income was a record million exceeding the prior record set in by million fourth quarter earnings of million an eps of were a linked quarter decrease of million and respectively mostly due to the day two provision for the merchants loan portfolio quarterly pretax pre provision earnings declined by million to million with the decrease attributed to million of higher mergerrelated costs and million less interest income from the ppp portfolio partly offset by the full quarter earnings from merchants operations total deposits exceeded billion at yearend up billion from september and billion over the past year the merchants acquisition contributed billion to the sequential increase and our cost to deposits held steady at an alltime low of just basis points for both the quarter and the year this was down from basis points for all of the merchants acquisition added over million of liquidity to the balance sheet propelling the investment portfolio to billion with held in maturity and available for sale as of yearend the securities investment yield increased on a linked quarter basis from to however both quarters benefited from the prepayments of interest absent this the investment securities yield remained level at encouragingly new purchases during the quarter had an average yield above this level at and the duration of years the net interest margin decreased basis points on a linked quarter basis to mostly due to a decrease in the loan yields driven by a reduction in accelerated ppp fees and partly offset by higher yields on securities due to prepayments interest excluding ppp fees and prepaid interest the net interest margin declined basis point to the impact to margin from the merchants acquisition was de minimis for the year the net interest margin decreased by basis points due to reductions in loan and investment yields of bps and bps respectively as well as greater liquidity on the balance sheet ppp loans added basis points to the margin in driven by million of accelerated fee recognition as loans were forgiven this compares to when ppp loans negatively impacted the margin by basis points with only million of accelerated fee recognition columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 we believe our balance sheet is very wellpositioned for prospective rise in interest rates given its asset sensitivity we see significant opportunity in terms of improving yields as the fed begins to normalize monetary policy currently billion of loans within the portfolio were at their floor and we anticipate million to increase with a single 25basispoint rate hike meanwhile our deposit costs should remain among the lowest in the industry total loans rose by billion during the quarter to billion with billion coming from merchants adjusting for ppp forgiveness and day one merchants balances loans increased million or annualized new loan production was brought on an average tax adjusted coupon rate of million which compares to the overall portfolio excluding ppp loans of million noninterest income increased on a linkedquarter basis to million with for merchants for the year noninterest income decreased by million but when adjusted for the indiscernible share gain of million realized in the second quarter of it rose by million on the strength of card revenues financial services and trust income noninterest expense increased million on a linkedquarter basis to million and included million of new run rate expenses for merchants and an increase in acquisition and merger expenses of million offset by the million recapture for unfunded loan commitments our noninterest expense ratio declined to for the quarter and our operating efficiency ratio decreased points to with the addition of merchants we expect our quarterly noninterest expense run rate to be in the mid range in excluding deal costs expenses could start the year a little higher given seasonal factors and without the benefit of the merchant systems conversion planned for late this quarter the provision for income taxes was down slightly linked quarter to million representing the effective rate the higher rate stems from certain nondeductible merger costs income earned in california and other factors that trueup our full year effective rate to we expect our effective rate to be similar to the rate and with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron we had strong core loan growth in the fourth quarter powered by record production excluding ppp loans quarterly production of million was a new alltime fourth quarter high propelling full year production to billion for the first time in columbias history normal seasonality provided a bit of a headwind during the quarter with line utilization falling to and we continue to refill our pipelines and they remain to our satisfaction loans ended the year at billion which was up billion or and excluding the ppp portfolio up billion or during the quarter with billion attributed for merchants growth in cre led the way during the quarter with million of production predominantly with rental and leasing properties followed by ci production of million spread across all sectors during the quarter the mortgage team originated and sold million of loans with the mix purchased and refis for all of million of mortgages were originated and sold the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio now stands at ppp nonppp fixed floating and variable columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 ppp loans were million at the end of the year and merchants added million with overall payoffs during the quarter of million at yearend deferred fees related due to the ppp portfolio totaled million with the addition of merchants the geographic loan distribution is now washington oregon california and idaho with the remaining in other states we rose to number one sba position in the seattle district and are now the leading sba lender in both the seattle and portland districts going forward we have our sights set on being the leading sba lender in all of the communities we serve as was mentioned deposits grew by billion during the quarter with billion from merchants the deposit mix did not change remaining at business and consumer at year end the product mix shifted slightly from to demand and interest bearing clint mentioned the record setting year that our wealth management group had nearing million in revenue this has been the culmination of years of building internal partnerships and our focus on deepening existing client relationships and we are very pleased with the progress now well turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you chris the primary driver of this increase of million in the allowance for credit losses over the quarter to million is the increase in the loan portfolio from the merchant bank of commerce acquisition a day one allowance for credit loss reserve of million was added for purchase credit deteriorated loans in the acquired portfolio and a million provision was added for the remaining loans these additions were partially offset by a more favorable economic forecast and improvement in the credit quality of the overall portfolio the ihs market economic forecast is more favorable than last quarter particularly with respect to unemployment which is a major driver for the model last quarter the unemployment rate was expected to end at and remain above prepandemic levels through the end of the current forecast assumes an unemployment rate in at and remains at or below prepandemic levels throughout the forecasted period the current forecast for gdp continues to be healthy with a fullyear gdp growth expectation for remaining the same as the forecast last quarter at and growth expectations for only slightly lower than the forecast last quarter at despite the continuing challenges the pandemic has been causing our borrowers have been able to adapt to this new environment and have shown great resilience npas for the quarter improved basis points to basis points and passthrough loans were only basis points net chargeoffs annualized were basis points and our impaired capital ratio improved from to we are continuing to see credit quality improve across the whole portfolio and on the risk rating front loans rated watch or worse decline from million to million as of yearend okay back to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andy this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions and now katherine lets open the call for qa columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co clint maybe just to start with and not to make a big deal out of this but the lending team announcement that you had this week i think its a pretty good proxy for a group that at least was aware of the pending merger with umpqua and i guess maybe the timing of those discussions or did you as you engage with those folks prior to the umpqua merger and then secondly just there may be kind of talk about their attraction to the platform given the merger and how their confidence kind of going forward if you could clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah ill share with you what i can in terms of the timing it was post announcement and i think its back to some of the things that we feel and you probably heard from cort and tory in the last hour is that what were creating is a franchise that hasnt existed in the northwest for or years and for ci bankers they want to be in an organization where they know that theyre going to be able to meet the needs of their existing needs of their clients but also grow the relationship as those businesses grow and i think that they saw first what our capabilities are today on a standalone basis as well as the information we put out with respect to the combination with umpqua and they got excited by it and started the conversation and theyve hit the ground running theres im not going to share any numbers with you but even i was very pleasantly surprised by what they have in flight right now theyre keeping andy busy keeping him off the ski slopes so thats one aspect of it but i also want to share with you that weve done some other things we added a physical presence in the phoenix market for our national health care platform and we think thats going to be very complementary postclose to things that umpqua is doing with the announcements theyve made with hires in that market well be able to fold that in and have a more comprehensive offering in that market theres other markets that were also very actively engaged in conversations and looking at other teams that want to be a part of what were doing so more to come on that later but i do think its a i think its a testament to people that are in our markets that are familiar with both our organizations columbia and umpqua and they see that back to the comment that ive said many times is that we are more similar than what the market perception has been columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co sure good perspective i appreciate it clint just to shift gears maybe attack aaron a bit on the expenses could any chance you could sort of lay out how that mapped in the income statement where the merger costs were assuming legal data processing comp but any chance you could kind of discuss where those came from on the merger costs aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i can break that down for you and i think we said in the press release it breaks down between the two deals with of the total of the million million is related to merchants and the million is to umpqua but by line item it works out to about million is in the comp and benefits line about is occupancy another is in data processing software million is legal and professional about in advertising and promotion and then about in the other category jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it and then just a followon to your i think your guide you mentioned looking for a mid run rate on a quarterly basis ex the umpqua transaction maybe a little higher in the first quarter so youve kind of talked about expectations for i think if you think about growth rates i think that sets us but if we think about cost savings into that target of million is that what would you peg underlying expense growth rate in i know were getting way out there but safe to assume therell be some creep on a baseline ex the targeted cost saves clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc i guess were kind of mixed in standalone and combined there but the i think that and youve probably heard ron make similar comments on an earlier call but we are were very comfortable with the expense save targets that weve laid out certainly expenses all else equal are likely to trend higher as a result of some of the inflationary pressures that were obviously well aware of and have been enduring as well as the investments in the business that we intend to be making on a go forward basis so there is an element of expense growth in that were our internal targets for what we can achieve are better than what weve laid out in terms of the expense save guidance in the deal announcement jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc and jeff this is chris and ill add some color to that and at the beginning of this year we increased our starting wage to an hour for our nonexempt teams and as part of that process and youve been with us a long time youve heard of how we offset and were always looking for how we can cover that additional expense and we were able to find that offset through some of the financial things that we had and so we feel really confident that weve covered that increase to our starting wage and it wont show up in our ongoing run rate columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay i appreciate the detail there thank you ill step back operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey matt matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co maybe just sticking with the expenses do you happen to know the amount of cost saves that youve realized to date in the bank of commerce deal and whats left aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc the ill followup with you on that matt which i think were tracking right in line with what we expect in fact i think we might actually be a little bit ahead of what were expecting so were in good shape but i dont have that number right in front of me at the moment i can maybe try to pull it up before the call ends matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just you may have hit this during your prepared comments and i apologize if you did but on the better than expected cost control this quarter exmerger charges held in a lot better than expected can you speak to anything unusual i know you guided for the upcoming quarter and the outlook but anything unusual this quarter aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think we had the million benefit from the negative provision in the quarter i think that might be whats your what youre thinking out there matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co nothing above and beyond that though aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay okay and then on the commercial real estate growth stepped up meaningfully this quarter can you speak to the underlying properties you guys are financing and where youre sourcing the growth from in terms of customers whether existing or new clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah matt its a combination of both and its not straying from anything that we have typically done or looking at owner user as well as other types of projects that are out there as well but nothing that falls out of moving away from our historic portfolio and what we would normally do but i will say there is a good mix of existing clients as well as due to our approach we continue to attract new clients from other institutions and thats got a really positive outlook as we go forward matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the loan pipeline if you could quantify it and how it compares to last quarter or yearover year clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc were still very pleased with it of course its down slightly after a record quarter as weve had previous record quarters i think the piece there is while its down slightly we have all the confidence with what weve talked about previously of a new team coming on and just the focus of our bankers of being external out in the market talking to our clients talking to prospects that will rebuild that and the prospects are good for this year by all means matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hi david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc just ill start on the growth side i mean growth exceeded forecast record fourth year originations digging into the numbers it almost looks a little bit better when you look and see that payoffs and paydowns were pretty materially higher just curious whether theres just some noise in the payoffs and paydowns line from the bank of columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 commerce deal and essentially normal season seasonal activity at the yearend or whether theres any other trends youre seeing just kind of taking this into account with the improving origination activity less loan participations given the combination with umpqua does this imply that we could actually see potentially accelerating growth just given the continued strong originations and normalizing payoffs clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yes theres a lot in there david i would say to try to pull it apart a little bit ive been very pleased with the activity from merchants or i should say the lack of payoff activity the process that we went through and retaining the teams retaining randy eslick on the as a leadership down there weve held on to the clients many of them are excited about the opportunity to be with a larger organization to be able to take of their needs they dont have to look anywhere else and thats only going to get a chance when we move forward with the umpqua combination now bringing it back more to our legacy piece of it we did have a fair amount of payoffs and paydowns during the quarter of some cre types of transactions that building sold things of that nature obviously as you mentioned the good news is the teams are active and theyre out and the originations are more than offsetting that i think rising interest rates so as they materialize we could start to see house paydowns to be somewhat muted i would say though that im cautious on businesses will still sell properties will still sell and things of that nature so i think all signs are pointing in the right direction we just have some we have a little ways to go before we see how it actually materializes david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay that makes sense and then just touching on deposits so getting deposit growth has remained extremely strong just curious how you think about deposit growth as we go forward do you think loan growth might start outpacing deposit growth as we head into next year or just given the increasing contribution from ci would you perhaps see outsized deposit growth clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah deposit growth is one that weve we spent a lot of time looking at i would love to tell you we have the exact crystal ball that we can predict whats going to happen i think the story there really is weve attracted the deposits weve attracted new clients we havent changed our philosophy about how we price so were winning these relationships on these deposits based on our capabilities based on our bankers and their relationships and the solutions that theyre providing i think that puts us in a really good position should rates start to rise that well be able to maintain kind of our historical cost of funds that weve had and how we follow that up but i think that what was really in there is we have a lot of liquidity and well be very mindful as we start to see where the flows go from money being spent i would caution that all the money being spent is staying in the system and it comes right back around into another clients account typically but more importantly im going to point you back to our bankers are winning business and thats bringing on new relationships and many of them are significant and so thats going to be a piece that if we started to see some deposits leave im pretty confident were going to continue to win that type of business and it should be able to offset it all things being equal thats where i would look at that aspect columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc and ill just david ill just add with all the deposit growth that weve had and the last two years weve done that and it hasnt changed what i think is some structural advantages that we have in our deposit base roughly half noninterestbearing businessoriented and we had for again another strong year of deposit growth at basis points for cost of funds and so i think that quality highquality deposit franchise that weve been known for a very long period of time its actually been strengthened and not diluted by the growth and so its a good firstworld problem for us to have which is how do we deploy that liquidity we could have outstripped loan growth and so well see theres a lot of activity going on i think chris is trying to contain his excitement about the economic activity in our existing markets and then the focus that we have with our umpqua combination and the momentum that we still have each as separate companies and our strategy around having the integration management office to insulate our clientfacing bankers from all the integration activities i think weve seen that play out over the last three months and i think were going to see that momentum continue to carry well into and david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats a really good point and kind of dovetails into my last question i was hoping to get kind of an update on how the update on how the umpqua merger those discussions are going and just whether you i was hoping you could provide us with a little bit of color and detail around the increase in indiscernible office and just some of the things that that team is working on currently to help ensure a smooth integration and again like you said preventing the disruption on the producer side clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah so chris was in my office before the call and we were talking about an existing client relationship that wants to expand what they do with us significantly in anticipation of our combination with umpqua we also had another conversation about some production teams eric eid comes into my office and hes talking about vendor selection how the process for the redundant facilities or the excess facility space that we have something like even our hris system which sounds like its not just payroll its how we train and develop our people and the integration throughout our company and so thinking about the employee experience as we go through the integration so chris is very focused on the client piece and others its a whole executive team but im just giving you some illustrative examples of the types of things that theyre working on and how theyre staying i guess staying in their lane and executing on that vision of insulating the clientfacing bankers from any distraction theres a lot of activity around planning towards the day one close and converging processes and policies and all of those discussions are taking place chris and then on the umpqua from the umpqua team tory theyre not totally isolated from this they do sit on the steering committee that we have and so theyre involved but theyre not consumed by it ill tell you that eric and then his counterpart at umpqua drew they are consumed by integration planning activities right now david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great color thanks everybody operator thank you and we have a question from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi there jon arfstrom rbc hows everybody doing clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good how are you jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc good good question for you aaron just on the margin in the release it feels like youre almost optimistic on the outlook for the margin or at least less pessimistic if you set rates aside how do you feel about just the prospect of margin stabilization maybe some of the puts and takes you want us to think through aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i think were getting close i would highlight that that in the quarter we had a pretty good amount of what we called prepay income on the mortgage on the bond book and yes the that was about million so weve got a pretty good bump from that thats about where we have a little bit of that each quarter so that was about three times what we might ordinarily see in a quarter so that helped in our on our investment securities yield during the quarter the loan yields in the quarter if you look at where the tax adjusted coupon was exppp was million and the new loans came on the book at million which was about the same level as the prior quarter that does bounce around quite a bit but so the new loans are coming on still below where the portfolio is so i think theres still a likelihood for some pressure there but i think that were getting closer to a bottom or inflection point and i think very importantly obviously the tone around the likelihood of rate hikes weve already seen it exhibited in the at the longer end of the curve the tenure is up prematurely over the past quarter and were seeing that too in our new bond purchases already and hopefully well start seeing that in on the loan side as well though thats likely to take a little longer and we could ultimately see a little bit of slight compression before the real benefit of higher rate hikes materialize but we obviously have a fantastic funding base but the balance sheet is very asset sensitive we have really good disclosure in the deck i would point you to actually a new slide that we put in its slide jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc slide aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc investor presentation because its weve historically presented a pretty conservative picture in terms of our betas but and whats assumed in our interest rate sensitivity and so we provided some additional beta levels going down as low as which even still is above the beta that we exhibited during the last repricing cycle so i think that will give you a better picture of just how powerful higher rates can be to our net interest income as we hopefully get the benefit of that columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah i was just going to you answered my followup on that because it just feels like maybe your deposit base like others is a little bit different at this point than the last cycle and id probably take the bet on lower betas at least early on but i think thats good information aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc indiscernible and also it has to go back to clints earlier comment too about the strength of our noninterestbearing deposits and how our clientele is truly differentiated with our commercial focus are the percentage of noninterestbearing deposits the total percentage of the total increase during the last great rising cycle and theres not a lot of institutions to concur that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay andy one for you on the provision it looks like absent bank of commerce we would have had another negative provision or reserve release how do you how are you feeling about overall credit and theres anything that you would call out other than growth that would impact the provisioning going forward andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah your conclusion is correct we would have had a release obviously were feeling pretty good with where the portfolio stands we enjoyed a lot of healing during the quarter as well as during the year i think that the economic forecast is beginning to stabilize and as you know cecl is very dependent on the economic forecast that you used so as that stabilizes itll create less volatility in the model and i think that the provision will become much more stable as well quartertoquarter so in general i feel good about credit quality and i feel optimistic about the levels of provisioning that we would have to do even given growth jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks everyone thats all i had andrew l mcdonald a chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks jon operator thank you and im showing no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back to clint stein for closing remarks aaron james deer chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jan2022 actually before we go i just want to respond to matthew clarks question on the cost saves on the merchant steel yeartodate we have realized million annualized in terms of the cost saves by the end of this quarter i think we should be around indiscernible about a little over of what weve targeted and at this point our expectation is that we do better than target on a cost saves so were tracking as expected and looking good on that front ill turn it over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks aaron thank you for attending our fourth quarter call we look forward to seeing many of you in the coming weeks in the meantime have a
