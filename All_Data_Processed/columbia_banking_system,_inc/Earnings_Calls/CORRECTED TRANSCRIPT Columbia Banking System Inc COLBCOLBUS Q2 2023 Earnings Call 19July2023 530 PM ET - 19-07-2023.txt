these markets ill now turn the call over to ron ronald l farnsworth executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc okay thank you clint and for those on the call who want to follow along i will be referring to certain page numbers from the earnings presentation starting on slide we are projecting achievement of million in cost synergies as of june again we are well on track to hit the million annualized target as of september and are targeting the higher number by yearend as we complete the final stages of integration next on slide we present the remaining balance of discount marks as compared to the prior quarter and at closing for the afs portfolio the acquired discount was reduced million via accretion to interest income in our earnings release detail we include this million along with million of higher bond interest income from the portfolio restructure we completed postclose to arrive at the million of total accretion for bonds on the loan side we had million of rate accretion and million for credit the total marks declined million in  through a combination of accretion to interest income and the loan sale slide covers our liquidity including deposit flows during the quarter for comparability we presented the table on the left as if we were combined for all periods presented total deposits declined in the second quarter market liquidity tightening and the impact of inflation on consumer spending continued to pressure customer deposit balances we utilize shortterm brokered deposits and federal home loan bank borrowings to fund the outflows and maintain the higher on balance sheet liquidity the upper right table details are offbalance sheet liquidity with billion available as of quarterend below that we had cash and excess bond collateral not pledged for lines to arrive at total available liquidity of billion this represents of uninsured deposits as of quarterend on the next page slide we detail out the investment portfolio the upper left able takes you from current par to amortized cost to fair value noting the difference between current par and amortized cost is the combined net discount which will be accreted to interest income over time the decline in market value this quarter of course resulted from slightly higher market yields on the front end of the curve as you can tell im excited about this portfolio as it does give us significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality the overall book yield was with an effective duration of as of quarter end and lastly we only have million in ph hcm bonds which represents some crerelated bonds with no unrealized loss to better help investors given the combination accounting and moving parts on slide we provide an updated outlook for on several key financial statement items our lower nim assumptions incorporate the second quarters funding remix guided ranges incorporate stability at the upper end of the range and continue to remix at the lower end our gaap nim is further impacted by lower accretion estimates as higher interest rates have slowed prepayment assumptions delaying the realization of the discount into income our expense outlook includes an estimate for the fdic special assessment we expect to hit in  and we continue to expect a quarterly expense run rate excdi in the million to million range in  this run rate includes the realization of all cost savings by september and is unchanged from last quarters guide slides through provide summary financials for  but i want to take you forward to slide here we break out  gaap earnings to help investors understand the nonoperating and mergerrelated impacts and columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 resulting core bank results in the far right column the first column represents our  gaap fully combined results with the net income of million or per diluted share the second column includes our non operating designation for income statement changes mostly related to fair value swings along with million of merger costs included in noninterest expense which are detailed out in the appendix these net to a million reduction in  earnings resulting in the third column for operating income now our operating income for  sic  on a fully combined basis was million or per diluted share with our return on assets at and return on tangible common equity at fourth column presents the net effect of the merger accounting which net to million or per diluted share taking us to the last column we show the core bank excluding the merger accounting benefit with solid results of more than million in income or per diluted share and return on tangible equity while this is lower than expected when our combination was announced it reflects higher borrowing costs with qt deposit outflows even with the higher interest expense it is great to see the benefit of this combination with a return on tangible equity excluding the net merger accounting benefit now im going to reiterate this page is the key page the bridge from gaap reported earnings isolating non operating and fair value changes then the mergerrelated items of discount accretion and cdi and then to adjusted operating income the discount accretion will be a steady and reliable source of interest income over time as the majority is driven by rate not credit providing with a steady build of capital over time as well we continue to clearly highlight it here to aid investors in valuing both the accretion and the core bank appropriately okay with that moving ahead for a couple more items slide breaks out accretion from net interest income slide does the same for the margin the decline in nim from the prior quarter and from prior expectations resulted directly from higher borrowing cost to offset the qt fueled deposit decline the nim excluding paa for the month of june was slightly under the  level of and the excess liquidity held on balance sheet had a roughly basis point impact on the month of june nim slide breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio noting is fixed is floating and are adjustable and slide provides an updated view of our combined interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios we have taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a future declining rate environment as you can see here the trending over the past few quarters where our rates break down or our rates down risk have been reduced significantly and noted below we calculate our cycletodate funding betas which are calculated on a combined company basis over the periods presented for comparability as of the second quarter our interestbearing deposit portfolio has priced in of the fed funds rate increases notable here is the cost of interestbearing deposits which at for the month of june matches the quarterend spot rate of highlighting stability and finally in the back on slide we highlight our regulatory capital position noting our riskbased capital ratios increased roughly basis points in  we expect to quickly approach our longterm capital targets of on total riskbased capital which will provide for enhanced flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders and with that i will now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 thank you ron turning to slide origination volume of billion in the quarter was offset by prepayments payoffs and the decision to sell roughly million in nonrelationship loans as outlined in our earnings release excluding sales and reclassifications to heldforsale loans expanded by on an annualized basis during the quarter slide detail select characteristics of our loan portfolio by major category with added details surrounding production during the second quarter additional industry detail for our commercial portfolio is provided on slide and slide provides a number of data points on our office portfolio given investor focus on this asset category i encourage you to review it in detail as it provides credit and repricing information on this diversified granular portfolio that is primarily supported by properties located in suburban markets moving on slide highlights our reserve coverage by loan category additionally the remaining credit discount on loans provides a further basis points of lossabsorbing capacity the million provision expense recorded during the quarter reflects several variables which include stabilizing credit trends in the finpac portfolio and reserve release associated with nonrelationship commercial loans that were sold and reclassified slide provides an overview of our consolidated credit trends in general our credit performance is and has remained positive ex the anticipated trend in finpac chargeoffs as previously communicated finpac charge offs remained elevated during the second quarter still centered in the trucking sector of the portfolio earlystage delinquency trends continue to improve indicative that a plateau has been reached chargeoffs will retreat at a lag there is no indication of any spillover to the broader commercial portfolio or other sectors within finpac excluding finpac chargeoff activity at the bank remains at a very low level ill now turn the call over to tory torran b nixon presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thanks frank turning to deposits slide highlights the quality of our granular deposit base market liquidity tightening the impact of inflation on consumer spending and businesses use of cash contributed to the modest deposit contraction and remix that took place during the second quarter due to the ongoing efforts and expertise of our bankers we continue to have a very high rate of customer retention we successfully consolidated branches over a fourweek period in may and june an extensive planning process proximity of existing umpqua branches to locations that were closed and the outstanding customer service provided by our teams contributed to our ability to execute consolidations without disrupting our customers or impacting accounts in any discernable way as clint highlighted we are taking strategic actions to further support our focus on relationship banking the sale of nonrelationship loans aligns with our intent to deploy liquidity into businessgenerating activities that provide more balanced growth opportunities continued expansion of products and services like deposit gathering capabilities to support our commercial banking teams and wealth management options within existing and newer markets provides avenues for growth and enhance company profitability we continue to add talent across our footprint and our teams success drives our enthusiasm for future prospects i will now turn the call back over to clint columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks tory our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide we remain above both wellcapitalized and internal threshold targets we increased our regular dividend during the second quarter to per share highlighting the foundational strength of our combined organization and as ron discussed we expect capital to continue to accrete quickly in the coming quarters providing us with ample flexibility for future shareholder return this concludes our prepared comments the team is now available to answer your question towanda please open the call for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks and good afternoon clint maybe you could just tackle that last comment that you had on capital it looks like your cet1 target now north of or north of the target i should say i guess just indiscernible question that i mean you raised the dividend but kind of want to see or check in on the attractiveness of a buyback or further from here potentially on the dividend either an increase or special from here clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure so if you think about the various ratios the one that is the i guess the constraint at the current time is total riskbased capital our longterm target for that has been for quite a while is and so we still got a little bit of room to grow into that target and just in general if you take the regulatory requirements to be wellcapitalized at basis points so whatever ratio youre using thats going to align pretty closely with how we think about our optimum longterm targets so were not there on total riskbased capital yet but when we do get there and as weve talked over the past couple of quarters and in our prepared remarks capital will accrete pretty quickly and all those things you mentioned will be things that well discuss with our board and certainly remain distinct possibilities in terms of regular dividend special dividend and the potential for buybacks but not in the next quarter or so i dont think jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay got it then checking in on the i guess the expectations for deposits in the second half both deposit flows i guess thats the first question on balances the second question would just be your betas see the total beta at or interestbearing at i think ron mentioned maybe some indication of some stability there just wanted to check in on your terminal deposit beta expectation so one part deposit flows second part is sort of the terminal beta thanks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 hey jeff good afternoon this is ron let me take the last part of that and ill come back to tory for the first part so on the betas yeah were at the cumulative our model is closer to per the footnotes on that page but as we said pretty consistently in the last couple of quarters we expect to be below that by the time we get to the end of this recent cycle or at least a couple of quarter lag on the back end of that so id expect continued modest increase in that beta but staying well shy of the tory torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah i mean if you look at the kind of the flow deposit we did a lot of analysis over the course of the quarter i mean kind of go back to slide you look at the granularity of the deposit base i mean our average consumer deposit is our average commercial deposit is and most of the analysis really just showed this the flow of cash is normal business usage and some quantitative tightening inflation is up but just kind of normal business activity and normal business usage so pipelines for us on deposits look really really strong and as we went through conversion and the teams were out theyve kind of turned their attention outbound and really working hard to generate a lot of activity so we feel really good about the energy and the activities that are happening in the company on certainly on the fee income and on the deposit side jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and tory the inflation and marketrelated pressure impacting deposit levels has that abated at all i guess if we look at early in the second quarter to where we look at early now third quarter i guess im looking for three months look back are we in a better spot obviously we have tax season thats not impacting us seasonally in the second half but just want to i know its a tough question to answer but just in firmer footing in terms of that the inflation and market pressure items torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah i think the best way for me to answer that is if i look at even the change in the average account balance quarteroverquarter its from on the consumer side to and to so its just a natural flow of cash being used for business activities typically for us the second half of the year especially because of the ag portfolio you start to see a run up in deposit balances so my expectation is upon looking at the pipelines and thinking about kind of historical trend weve got some nice momentum or deposit activity in the second half of the year jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thank you im sorry one last just a housekeeping the outlook slide on the expenses for the million to million run rate i cant carve out you guys kind of talking about opportunistically you might have more cost synergies than you announced on the deal is that inclusive of those additional opportunities or are we looking at something lower than million to million and is that timing outside of this calendar year ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 hey jeff this is ron again that number does not include the additional above the million well talk more about that in october call once we hit the million outlook for the balance of  we could see going into early  clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well jeff this is clint again the one thing i would add to that is part of the reason we said early on that we had a higher internal target was the uncertainty around inflation but also while the merger was pending we expanded our footprint and were in some new markets and were going to invest in those markets and so part of that is maybe a reallocation of that expense into expanding in certain parts of our footprint jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate it thank you operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of matthew clark with piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey matt matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co maybe just on the loan sales i think they were mentioned in your prepared remarks and in the slide deck any sense for additional sales from here and just trying to get a sense for whether or not theres deliberate loan sales still to come and flattish loan balances are kind of a reasonable forecast consistent with this quarter torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hi its tory again dont really anticipate future loan sales at this point and where we exited from were just really transactional participations in larger syndications that just wasnt the right deployment of capital and liquidity from our perspective so it was a good move for the company and right thing to do and really kind of its over and kind of its moving forward matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay and then can you address a media report that came out just a couple of weeks ago on multifamily suggesting that umpqua was getting out of that business just want to confirm whether or not thats true or not columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah its tori again its definitely not the case and not accurate we existed the multifamily division which was a part of the commercial bank that had existed at kind of legacy umpqua bank for quite some time up billion to billion in assets small garden style apartments average deal about million and it was just we just made the decision that again is very transactional it wasnt in line with the commentary around really strong full relationship banking and so exited that business but we have many other parts of the company that will continue to do multifamily lending for our customers in the commercial real estate division and community commercial banking so we will continue to do lots of multifamily lending were just not doing it through the multifamily division matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc welcome operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah great thanks ron maybe a margin question looking at your slide you gave the range of on a core basis to for  and obviously you talked about what would it take to get to the high and low end of that to get to your full year guide of to that would imply kind of an exit if you assume the low end of around i guess i wanted to take your temperature on your thoughts about that entering if the fed stays at high rate like how do you view the core margin of this company trending once the fed is done ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey chris this is ron so again the  guide we included indiscernible based off of deposit flows in the third quarter and sort of talk a bit about indiscernible see how that plays out im not saying that the guide says on an exit velocity basis this is a blended this is an annual number but it also recognizes the fact that the first two months of the year was umpqua holdings standalone we closed the combination for the month of march and then thats filtered in through the year so one would assume if there are stable deposit flows we will be pretty consistent in the  as we expect to be in  and again thats going to be the determining factor christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so the to range for  that could also be the range for  based on i just want to make sure i got that buttoned up is that right columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc very much so very much so christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc again sensitivity within that range we based off deposit flows simple as that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood okay got it thanks and then on the expenses i just want to come back to it i know youve talked about investing some of the additional savings is that kind of what youre trying to message to us that you may have more to talk about next quarter but dont go in putting additional cost saves in the numbers is that kind of what youre trying to message clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sort of yeah chris this is clint yeah what we stated all along was that we were committed regardless of what was going on with inflation tight labor market and everything else to delivering a minimum of million of cost savings to the bottom line but that we also were working on other internal opportunities so that we had flexibility to address those issues and also during that time period separately umpqua and columbia both expanded into the phoenix market umpqua expanded into the colorado market and columbia into the utah market our commitment is to bank bring our full scope of services and solutions to those markets and so part of that just frankly is some retail locations and we can essentially kind of just put a rough number out on what each retail location costs us and so those are ways that by taking that extra amount and well tell you as we go kind of you might read about lets say we establish a branch location in utah well put out a press release youll read about it and then well talk about okay heres how we offset the costs so i think thats how you can expect the narrative to go but it will be outside of the scope of that million that weve been talking about christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then if i could just get to a couple of modeling quick ones on the tax rate a little help there will be great and then the special assessment most of your banks havent talked about it dropping in the third quarter at least that ive talked to is that i guess that would be in is that just a kind of a onetime or a step up in the investment rate ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey chris this is ron tax rate target indiscernible just a little bit above or a little bit below but we target internally and on the special assessment the consensus is that it would be expensed once the columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 rule is finalized we expect that here in the third quarter you see all the expense for that in  to be paid out in the course of two years christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thank you operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hello this is janet lee on for steve alexopoulos my first question is on nim so to for thats a fairly wide range can you talk through what level of noninterestbearing deposit mix is assumed for that low and high end of that guidance and whats your bias based on where you stand today in terms of the nim ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah this is ron again and following up just on the comments from earlier so if we see consistent flows on the deposit side like we saw in  in the third quarter wed be on the lower end of that range if it stabilized wed be in the middle and if it got better then the upper same for  from that standpoint so thats simply the driver there janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right is there so relative to of noninterestbearing deposit mix today do you think that pace of non interestbearing deposit outflows could lessen from here or will that stay fairly consistent of what you saw in the second quarter if you look through the second half of ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc again im just going back to what we talked about if we see consistent deposit flows including the mix shift reduction in noninterestbearing increase in money market areas and itd be in the lower end of that range third and fourth quarter if it stabilizes which it has through early middle of july but again its only that middle of july theres still two net months ago on the quarter and that would change so hope thats pretty straightforward right janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay okay and for the if you look at the second half of the year what is there a level of cash you want to maintain on your balance sheet over the near term versus billion or billion would you contemplate any borrowing paydowns versus what you have as of the second quarter over the near term columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah in a normalized world my expectations will be interestbearing cash flows will be about half of where they are now so you get a sense of what we consider the excess on balance sheet we think its prudent in this environment just given the uncertainties with the qt fueled the deposit outflows and id also point out that that cash is sitting at the federal reserve running at so the net effect of that is that additional billion is pretty small and talking maybe like six times of on quarterly basis so we just think its prudent to hold that at this point just based on the environment till the outlook clears before we make some moves janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and in terms of the reserve levels assuming no major changes in economic forecasts is the second level reserve ratio a good level you would like to maintain i understand that reserve releases some has to do with the lowered sales but in terms of the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean based on cecl right with the economic forecast thats where we feel the reserve should be i think if all else remains equal which is a big if right up or down it will stay about that level if not drift down to closer to over time and when i say over time i think about just longterm history of net chargeoffs and then the duration of the loan book its generally going to be like bps over the course of four years would give you at around bps so were a bit above that at this point based in part on the economic forecast based in part on the mrs et cetera so near term id expected to stay around the current levels unless theres a significant change in economic forecast janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks and my last question how should we think about the loan growth for the rest of torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hi janet this is tory nixon i think i touched on just briefly earlier the loan pipeline continues to grow and we are looking at a lot of really good strong opportunities in the company throughout our eight western states its for relationship banking were not making loans for people who dont put deposits with us and we dont provide fee income opportunities for so were looking at full relationship banking which is we feel is the best way for us to carry the bank forward i feel we have opportunity to grow the loan book and its going to be mid to lowsingle digits for loan growth but i think good prudent loan growth that supports relationship growth and relationship banking is what we will continue to do throughout the footprint janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo your line is open columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good afternoon everybody ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good afternoon jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe looking at the mortgage revenue how should we be thinking about revenue there with the normalized impact from hedging and the planned msr sale ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah this is ron id say levels would be consistent again assuming rates stay relatively consistent with where they are now thats obviously been the big story within mortgage lending over the last yearandahalf we are targeting that sale billion of msr just to reduce continue to reduce future volatility so that also played into the fact that you didnt have the msr fair value gain this quarter because we had locked in that price a bit earlier in the quarter before you saw some of the indiscernible market so still very much core product and indiscernible clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah thanks ron jared i think weve settled into a nice place with the pivot from more of a brokerage model into more of a bank model plenty of coverage out there ill tie it to torys comments around relationships were seeing our customers come in requesting purchases its granular across the footprint focusing more on heldfor sale and less on portfolio but its still products and its still out there wed still have some construction lending thats in the pipeline thats going to wind down over the next couple of quarters as well but i think the team there should be applauded for making the shift making the transition and i really like the offering that we have in the current environment jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks operator thank you please stand by for our next question our next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good afternoon everyone thanks for taking the questions i was hoping maybe just to follow up on the msr sale i know you get the capital relief from the reduction in the msrs but i just wanted to ask did you happen to disclose what the gain from the sale of the msr that you expect to book is just given those are pretty valuable right now columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc this is ron id say we carry that fair values so its not going to be a gain or loss on sale we basically price that billion at the locked in sale price roughly basis points in the overall balance of the portfolio the overall portfolio sit at as of quarterend so there is some liquidity discount that weve noticed here when it comes to the market itself with overall where the levels of that asset is but no additional gain or loss on that component of the msr when its sold brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay thank you for that clarification and i did just want to follow up also on the loans that you sold this quarter could you just walk me through maybe the accounting of how that works i mean what happened to the marks that were on those loans that you sold if there was a mark and then was the negative million change in the fair value of certain lhfi loans was that tied to that loan sale at all ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah brody this is ron again no the million was related to a separate portfolio thats carried at fair value and the fact that you had rates increase led to the fair value loss itll slip and become a fair value gain when rates decrease in terms of the loans that were sold that were marked we had a roughly loss on sale recognized in  therell be about a gain on sale recognized in  just given we didnt get all billion of that settled we had million of it sitting in held for sale we werent able to recognize it so itll be close to a push but that just means that the sale price was right on top of our march price in terms of the rate and credit discounts so no significant gain or loss on that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and i just want to follow up on the nim guidance and i hear you on the different scenarios on the mix shift dynamics but ron i think we tried to talk about in the past sort of what youre assuming for an interestbearing or a total deposit beta moving forward its obviously not the 50plus that indiscernible last cycle so just within that kind of to nim guide for the third quarter i guess what are you assuming for deposit cost or interestbearing deposit cost ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc were assuming the beta to move as it has over the last two quarters so small singledigit increase in the overall cumulative beta recognize   but still stay indiscernible by the time we get to the end of the year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right great thank you very much for that and then i did just want to follow up on the mortgage as well the gain on sale margins it seems like theres some differing dynamics amongst the banks this quarter reporting mortgage results i guess is the difference between what were seeing maybe with you and some others that have maybe different channels is that difference between retail origination channels and corresponding origination channels right now columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc if youre referring to again sale margin being higher than someone elses gain on sale margin yeah that could very much play into it for example if its wholesale its going to be a lower margin just by default because youre paying a commission to get the loan and to resell it so our gain on sale margins are relatively consistent around i think again that would be subject to volatility in the rate market over the near term but expect a relatively consistent number in that range over the balance of the year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then just real quick on the expenses that the fdic special assessment i think and maybe i was just quickly doing the math but it looks like youre saying about million is what to expect so it would kind of be fair to maybe talk that in as a onetime expense around that area for the third quarter ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc were estimating that just a bit underneath that so if you take the midpoint of the annual range from last april and you look at our updated guidance now youre probably talking high20 million range so somewhere in that range well see if it gets finalized and we do expect to expense all of that in the third quarter so there wont be any expense tail on it just be cash paid over time brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then the last one from me where do you view the normalized level of liquidity for the balance sheet going forward our cash balance is still a bit elevated and i guess if the deposit flows do start to stabilize at all would you look kind of maybe use those excess cash balances to pay down some borrowings ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah yeah we talked about this a couple of minutes ago right so ballpark i think ph interestbearing cash in an ideal world thered be about half of the level as it is now we brought on billion back on march just given the environment just to be conservative in the outlook with pressures so given theres still  deposit pressure out there we feel its prudent to hold onto that higher level in spring cash so as we see that change then that target level of on balance sheet cash will change but it hasnt happened as of this point and id say too of that billion in cash were sitting on at the fed so thats you could can see that itd be billion or so higher than ideal world and that is being carried in the borrowings when you look at the net cost of that given we got the cash parked at the fed its roughly on a quarterly basis so the number it gets indiscernible but not material we think its just pretty bold on the basis of liquidity for the time being brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it i guess one last one real quick just within the billion that you have in borrowings i guess like what portion of that could kind of quickly get paid down like how much of it is shortterm that could in theory get paid down through yearend if you decided to do so columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc we kept all of that in that call it two to fourmonth tenor so an idea that acting like a swap given a lot of that cash flow is in the bond portfolio if you do ever see rates down in the future but two to four months so a pretty quick turn brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you guys very much clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah thank you operator thank you please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of david feaster with raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc all right good afternoon everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just switching back to the loan side i appreciate your commentary obviously were focused on full relationships weve exited some of the more transactional businesses im just curious it looks like the growth that you did have excluding the loan sales was pretty broad based but where are you still seeing good risk adjusted returns right now and opportunity to gain those four relationships are there any segments or markets where you see more opportunity at this point torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah hey david this tory again certainly theres a ton of opportunity in this ci space for us throughout our footprint so weve got really highquality bankers throughout their eight western states and they have great pipelines great prospects a lot from within the bank existing customers and then new customers to the company so theres a ton of ci opportunities a lot of disruption depending on where you go in the footprint its a great opportunity for us so i see thats a big focus for us and will continue to be what comes with the ci columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 lending opportunity is going to be noninterestbearing deposits other deposits good core fee income kind of everything were looking for david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay that makes sense and then maybe just following up kind of on clints comments a bit earlier about the branch locations and supporting the hires that youve made i guess whats your appetite for additional hiring i mean theres been a lot of disruption and dislocation around you is that are you seeing opportunities for would it be more focused on the ci front are there any new segments that you would be interested in expanding into im just curious how you think about that and more market expansion or would it be kind of infill as we look at some of the expansion is it infill or truly market expansion at this point clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey david this is clint the answer is yes for all of those were always on the lookout for quality bankers that can help us grow our franchise long term and thats in the newer markets i mean thats how even with the pending merger of the size and magnitude that we had we were able to attract top talent in new markets and expand into arizona utah and colorado and so with the disruption yeah there are some opportunities im going to pass it over to tory and chris and let them talk about maybe some of the more specific things that theyre focused on christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah thanks clint and david this is chris quickly on your last question i would say theres a little bit of growth as i mentioned in that mortgage part of the portfolio of construction so that goes along with the commercial side as far as locations and segments i think weve talked over the years about the best time to hire somebody is when theyre available and theyre ready versus putting postings out there and trying to go into a market and build on that i think you find the best quality bankers so reiterating what clint said the answer is yes now with some in that were looking at the newer markets of we should have things out there soon around utah arizona follow up with colorado for some locations to support our bankers as tory mentioned earlier and then from there we do see some infill opportunities and we get our hands around some of the opportunities in southern california market and things of that nature itll look a little different itll be branches to support our commercial efforts our small business efforts and you wont see as many or the density that you would pick up in the northwest but yeah from there were pretty excited about those opportunities and ill kick it over to you tory torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc i dont think i have much to add we got a great company with a great opportunity and people want to work here and its a fun story to tell and im looking forward to us to continue to grow the organization christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 yeah i think with a model and what weve put together youre really seeing opportunities where people are intrigued to join up at our size with our capabilities and then ultimately with our philosophy of how we go to market as a community bank of scale david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats helpful and im just curious i guess what kind of branches are you looking to roll out i mean is it more prototypical branches are we looking at smaller footprints and then where does that kind of neighbor hub play into this that was a concept that you guys had been dabbling with im just curious kind of what is the branches that youre looking to expand look like christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc they will certainly be smaller thats anything that weve done where weve had the opportunity to move or lease things of that nature weve downsized considerably typically its more of an open concept you dont walk in and see a indiscernible to go along with that neighbor hub concept we have some things we call financial hubs that are very similar but they house other types of bankers in there with that neighbor hubs specifically there are certainly opportunities it requires a neighborhood that is a fairly dense walkable things of that nature and were always on the lookout for it the last one we opened was in boise and its right in the downtown core and its fantastic if youre over there check it out david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats helpful and then maybe just touching on credit more broadly i mean obviously you talked about the impact but outside of that i mean credits held up pretty well i mean npas are steady classified assets were down im just curious as you look at your portfolio is there anything that youre seeing thats causing you any concern or as you look in your crystal ball i guess how do you think about credit going forward and what are you watching perhaps more closely and maybe tighten standards the most frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc hey david this is frank yeah our portfolio certainly has held up very well and im personally not surprised by it i think what we continue to watch is you see some of the lower margin small businesses and consumers youre seeing delinquencies start to tick up there weve got our eyes on that but quite honestly i mean there are no big cracks developing im certainly watching the cmbs space as it relates to office as those cmbs pools begin to mature and valuations are completed and were seeing lower valuations we dont have direct exposure there but certainly on maturing obligations we are cognizant of the potential impact that could have on valuations and resizing deals within our portfolio we dont see that as an issue right now based upon the leverageaverse nature of our portfolio but thats something were watching very closely david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thats helpful thanks everybody operator thank you operator instructions please standby for our next question our next question comes from the line of andrew terrell with stephens your line is open columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc hey good afternoon clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc maybe just sticking on the last point on credit and office specifically and loan to values are really low at the book is obviously incredibly granular and more suburbanfocused but i was curious have you had any borrowers in the portfolio where you have gone through the process of reappraising the loan in the past quarter or just more broadly as you look at appraisals or valuations that are coming up in the market have you noticed any kind of trend or a level that valuations are declining for office properties or any kind of trends you can speak to there would be helpful clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah andrew theyre moving very slowly we just had one we just refinanced actually one in our portfolio with no issue so its kind of surprising how really relatively slowly cap rates and valuations are moving but other than that no we havent seen anything materially concerning or stressful in terms of rewriting some of these deals as immature andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay i appreciate the color and then on finpac specifically i think last quarter we talked about being a potential plateau in loss rates after that accelerated and we clearly saw a stepup again this quarter i guess can you give any color and i know its truckingrelated but were there a couple of larger deals within the portfolio that you charged off of this quarter and can you maybe just help give us some color on why the plateau has occurred here or that finpac loss rates should level off or potentially decline clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure weve guided this every quarter but when you look at yearend quarter and compare the day delinquencies to 60day delinquencies from that period to they are now down when you look at 91day and over delinquencies they are now over reduced and that sort of trend has been happening quarteroverquarter obviously since so when you look at the especially the later term delinquencies they are now reducing the earlier term delinquencies are reducing in that space and so that this portfolio is extremely predictive in that regard and so thats why i feel fairly comfortable in saying that the plateau has very likely been reached and we should see a decline from this point forward and the loss numbers the million in losses in the finpac portfolio of it has been related to the trucking portfolio as with the delinquencies so if you take off that million youre left with million and thats kind of the sweet spot of where finpac operates so things are looking as expected within that portfolio to me columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc great thats very helpful i appreciate it clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc sure andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc and then maybe a quick one for ron just going back to kind of discussion around the securities portfolio and then the borrowing position as well i understand kind of having the flexibility within the marked bond portfolio or the bonds and a gain position specifically but i guess with a little over billion of borrowings that are billion costs and potentially moving higher next week given those are shorter term i guess looking at like the spot yields on particularly the billion of securities in a gain position at a yield of on those the gain the bonds and a gain position i guess why not start to unwind or sell some of those bonds and pick up i dont know 100plus basis points on the margin and obviously be accretive to the nii as well i guess i appreciate some of the flexibility youve got but given the kind of underwater nature right now why not unwind some of that trade ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc well hey this is ron yeah so obviously though we took the discount through capital to get there by sell the bonds at these levels then im not going to recapture that so im very much looking at that more as a capital return over time from that standpoint and the borrowings weve got the flexibility to maintain these for the time being including the increase if need be over time so too early to talk about selling off bonds at the discounted prices id much rather have it when i have the discount come back and accrete to income over time andrew terrell q analyst stephens inc okay understood i appreciate it ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah thank you operator thank you please stand by for our next question we have a followup question from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey thanks for the followup maybe just a question on the health of the markets were hearing a lot about some of the strain in portland some of the other cities how is that how are your customers being impacted by that are you seeing more business moving to the suburbs or are you actually seeing businesses and people leaving the area and moving somewhere else columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 19jul2023 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc i think theres a little bit of all of that thats occurring so i think in the core downtown section of say portland businesses have moved to the suburbs umpqua bank is a great example of that weve seen some of that also in seattle but ill say this probably isnt a good measure but the mlb allstar events were in seattle last week and the city showed pretty well and its cruise season for the alaska cruises that leave from seattle and so theres quite a bit of tourism thats going on so theres a little more vibrancy but i dont think its businesses that are housed in those core downtown office towers likewise last night we had dinner in a section of downtown portland and it was pretty vibrant but it was more in the pearl district area and that tends to that hasnt really had the same impact that indiscernible that you saw on the news with the nights of riots or whatever it was so i would say a more optimistic on the core downtowns but i think that they still have a challenging path ahead of them the suburbs remain pretty vibrant and throughout our footprint so during the quarter chris tory frank and myself i think we visited customers in six of our eight states and a host of different industries and different sizes and theyre all very optimistic and their businesses are doing well and i think thats where you would have seen some of the optimism in torys response to the outlook for loans and then by default deposits because of the relationship focus that we have is a product of being out and seen what still pretty vibrant markets so i dont know if we end up with a soft landing i dont know if anybody does when it is its the recession thats never come but were seeing a lot of positive things from our customers and i think thats also why you see the credit metrics and absent that one little sector of kind of mom and pop trucking operations in finpac the credit portfolio continues to perform very very well i dont know tory chris if you want to add anything torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc no i mean i think youre spot on i think that the granularity of our markets we have customers in big urban markets and suburbs of those markets and we have a lot of customers in rural parts of the west and theres so much variety that its great for the bank its great for our balance sheet and its great for our earnings stream and to clints point going out and visiting all of these customers the one very consistent takeaway is how well everybody is doing and its great to see from what you read sometimes in media versus what you get with boots on the ground talking to people is very different jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen im showing no further questions in the queue i would now like to turn the call back to jacque bohlen for closing
