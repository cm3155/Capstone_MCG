president columbia banking system inc thank you clint and good morning everyone first quarter pretax preprovision income of million net income of million and earnings per share of were all new first quarter highs in spite of million of mergerrelated costs which decreased earnings by per share average earning assets increased by billion from the first quarter of including billion from the merchants bank acquisition this combined with the partial quarter impact of the feds march rate increase resulted in an increase in net interest income of million or over the prior year period linked quarter pretax preprovision income increased by adjusting for mergerrelated costs ppnr decreased by million partly due to the seasonal reset of payroll taxes and benefit costs as well as increased expense related to the higher starting wage we implemented yearend and more recent annual merit adjustments in addition loanrelated expenses normalized from a low level in the prior quarter total deposits ended the quarter at billion which was an increase of million from yearend first quarter inflows were predominantly in our money suite market product and our cost of deposits remained at our alltime low of just basis points total loans ended the quarter at billion excluding ppp balances loans increased by million or annualized growth was propelled by million in new loan originations and a modest increase in line utilization ppp forgiveness and paydowns dampened overall loan growth by million reducing total loan growth to million but still a solid annualized the net interest margin of was up basis points on the linked quarter basis mostly due to higher yields and investment securities and that was largely due to lower premium amortization on the portfolio ppp loans had a positive basis points impact in the first quarter which was down from basis points in the fourth quarter new loans were brought on at an average taxadjusted coupon rate of ph which compares to the overall portfolio excluding ppp of ph notably our balance sheet remains very wellpositioned for the rate increases expected to continue through the year still we may not see all of that benefit materialize in new loans given the intense price competition across our footprint as industry liquidity remains very high noninterest income was relatively flat on a linked quarter basis at million favorable nonrecurring items during the quarter included gains of and respectively on the sale of loans and the health savings account portfolio acquired from merchants bank in addition we had a gain on the sale of a vacant branch property these onetime items offset declines in mortgage banking and loanrelated income attributed to the higher interest rate environment noninterest expense of million increased by million linked quarter after adjusting for mergerrelated expenses of million in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter noninterest expenses columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 increased by million to million the linked quarter increase was mostly due to the aforementioned rise in compensation costs and loan expenses as well as a million increase in the provision for off balance sheet liabilities as seasonally elevated compensation costs drop off and merchants bank cost saves are fully realized we expect our expense run rate to be closer to the mid the provision for income taxes increased million on a linked quarter basis to million representing a effective rate and we expect our tax rate to remain in the to range ahead of our combination with umpqua and with that ill turn the call over to chris christopher m merrywell chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thank you aaron its been a busy quarter and we are seeing positive results from investments in our production and our support teams as aaron mentioned nonppp loan production of million was the largest first and our fourth highest quarter on record this is on the heels of our best quarter in company history exppp of million in the fourth quarter of our bankers continue to be successful in winning new business in the face of an intensely competitive lending environment as the economy has reopened and expanded our bankers deepened existing and built new relationships in all of our markets both producers and clients across our footprint appreciate the value of the upcoming combination with umpqua and the increased capabilities that it will bring our pipelines remain full and to our satisfaction line utilization was modestly during the quarter increases in construction line utilization were offset by the normal seasonal decrease in agriculture across the footprint a cold wet spring has delayed plantings for many crops resulting in weaker than normal advances we anticipate this to reverse in the second quarter as the warmer drier weather returns the quarterly production mix was fixed floating and variable the overall portfolio now stands at ppp loans nonppp fixed floating and variable as a result of higher rates we saw a drop in our mortgage warehouse business during the quarter with sold loans dropping from million to million overall the composition of the loan portfolio did not change materially deposits grew at an annualized rate of during the quarter and over the past months the sourcing of deposits was stable at business and commercial similarly the mix of deposits were fairly steady at noninterestbearing and interest bearing during the quarter we moved our wa branch to a new financial hub location and in july we will be opening our proctor district financial hub in tacoma and have begun construction on a new financial hub in astoria oregon these full service locations are uniquely focused on helping our clients achieve the comprehensive financial goals including investments trust services and other financial considerations now i will turn the call over to andy to review our credit performance andrew l mcdonald chief credit officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc thanks chris for the quarter we released million from our allowance this reduces our allowance from to compared to period end loan total driving the release was a decline in problem loans substandard loans declined million to around million or of total loans and special mention loans columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 declined million to around million or less than of total loans problem loans as a percentage of total periodend loans is now approaching prepandemic level to a lesser extent a modest decline in the loss rate for pass rated loans due to our most recent level of low chargeoff activity also contributed to the release the ihs markit forecast which we use for modeling purposes was fairly stable compared to last quarter and as such did not have a marked impact on our reserves for the quarter for example last quarter the unemployment rate was expected in at and remain at or below present prepandemic levels throughout the forecast period the current forecast also assumes the unemployment rate will end at and remain near pre pandemic levels throughout the forecast period the current forecast assumes full year gdp growth expectations for of compared to previous expectations of so last but not material in summary we are seeing credit quality metrics similar to that which we enjoyed prepandemic while we are pleased with this performance we remain cognizant of the current global environment and instability in europe along with the inflationary pressures here at home so while we are optimistic for the future performance of the portfolio near term we remain cautious as we look further down the road okay back to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks andy our regular quarterly dividend of was announced this morning this quarters dividend will be paid on may to shareholders of record as of the close of business on may this concludes our prepared comments as a reminder andy chris and aaron are with me to answer your questions now catherine well open the call for questions columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from jeff rulis with da davidson your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co a couple of questions on the loan portfolio the nonppp payoffs and prepays i think in the current quarter was a little over million combined what was that figure last quarter and then you touched on the line utilization what exactly was that percent that you touched on that was up a bit aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc i think the line utilization was up something like basis points let me see if ive got the exact number for you yeah it rose from basis points to basis points and what was the question on the ppp balances jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co what was i think prepays and payoffs in the nonppp i think it was a little over million in the current quarter if you combine those well how does that compare to the fourth quarter in other words payoffs and prepays indiscernible aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah they were down sequentially jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co fair enough i guess just borrowing that all up rolling into your growth outlook and expectation are pretty strong seasonal quarter on production wise how either specific or otherwise is loan growth expectations for the year christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah jeff i think that theres still a lot of liquidity out there and theres a lot of competition i think weve always been talking about midto highsingle digits i think thats a fair place to still project that out given everything thats going on in the market weve had had some new people that joined us back in the fourth quarter that we talked columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 about well start to see some production ramping up from that team and were working on other things as well but i think that midto highsingle digits is the right place to be jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay switching gears a little bit to the margin you mentioned premium amortization down linked quarter was that still an expense or did that flip to recapture in the quarter aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no thats still run as an expense but it was down sequentially probably around million jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it and aaron if you look at net of ppp impact the margin up basis points linked quarter to what how does that compare to the march monthly average on margin that aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc the sequential progression for the month when you back out kind of all the different ways it was actually pretty flat but we didnt get the real benefit in the loan yields until the last couple of weeks of the quarter and the and so thats just now starting to come through but i think what a good number to look at is where our taxadjusted loan coupon was exppp and that was up basis points sequentially to ph from and thats obviously very well poised to continue to see some nice lift here going forward jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from david feaster with raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good morning david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc i just want to touch just go back to the origination its great to see another record quarter i just wanted to get a sense of what you think is driving that is it theres a lot of factors is it the improved economic backdrop the benefits from the new hires that weve talked about less participations like youve mentioned moving upstream i columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 suspect its a combination of all that but just curious of your thoughts on whats driving the improved originations and then i know you talked about the pipeline being full but just in light of the record originations how is the pipeline trending quarteroverquarter and just the composition of that christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah david this is chris and i mean youre right it is a combination of all of that but specifically id say that its been a long time coming with our approach over the last couple of years of remaining open being there for our clients and ultimately for prospects so were winning new business thats coming from external to the bank because of that approach our bankers have been in front of people in front of our own clients theyre seeing opportunities for strategic investments things of that nature its fairly well balanced between true ci and cre as well now a little bit in the ag space and a little bit in construction as far as the new volume there but honestly i think the approach and then when you look at the trending combination and you see not just our bankers but you see our clients looking at the potential of whats coming downstream to potentially do more for them theyre voting on that aspect and signing up early some of them might be willing to go through a conversion and things with of that nature and i think that just bodes well for the process and what weve laid out there the new teams are starting to hit their stride it takes a little time the team that we announced that came on at the end of the fourth quarter theyre about days with us well start to see some positive impact from them as well and then again its just kind of a normal aspect of where weve always been of being out in front of clients and recognizing opportunities i would also mention that were seeing some positive uptick in the healthcare space both regionally and nationally as well david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just following up on the pricing front comparing the new production rates quarteroverquarter they were up a couple basis points obviously the rate hike came later in the quarter but just wanted to get a sense of how pricing and new loan yields are trending and then just any thoughts that you might have on the competitive dynamics in the market today christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah i dont think the competition has really changed much were still seeing some things where were choosing to walk away from longterm low fixed rates things of that nature we are seeing some improvement in the clients that value the advice and what were bringing to the table were seeing a little movement there youre right the increase came late in the quarter well see what takes place anything down the road but i would expect this is just kind of looking down the pipe that pricing competition is not going to let up but the rising rates should give us a little lift as well david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay that makes sense and then maybe shifting gears to the other side of the coin just talking on deposits i mean core deposit growth has been phenomenal youve got a tremendous lowcost core deposit base just wanted to get a sense of how you think about deposit growth going forward in light of the rising rate environment obviously you have the benefit of being able to be pretty defensive on this just given the strength of your deposit book but how do you i mean do you expect deposit flows to at least slow or maybe migrate within the portfolio or would you even expect maybe some outflows just any thoughts on trends with deposits would be helpful columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey david this is clint our crystal ball on that is a little fuzzy historically the first half of any year has been very little if any deposit growth and the last two to three years that hasnt been the case and obviously posted very strong deposit growth in the first quarter and i think some of that is just our continued growth and some of the market share that weve taken in certain areas that are less susceptible to seasonal fluctuations in deposits one of the things that we saw in the last rising rate cycle a few years ago was many of our customers with the deposit mix we have been heavily weighted towards commercial and noninterestbearing gives us a structural advantage but for those that that rate is meaningful we pushed several hundred million dollars off balance sheet during the last cycle through our cb financial services group and so were able to still serve that client without cannibalizing the cost structure of our entire deposit base and so those would be some of the strategies that well be leaning on chris and the entire team to implement as we go forward so if we see some declines in the deposits my expectation is its probably related to activities like that more so than necessarily complete attrition leaving the bank and ill turn over to chris to see if he has anything else to add christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah the only thing id really add there is our client base is not interest rate sensitive as some organizations and i think youve seen that over the historic performance of the cost of funds and such the options that clint mentioned were already looking at some of those and weve seen a little bit of movement but its not enough at this point to offset the growth that we had and yeah and i would say i think that clint talks about the crystal ball i think every time weve said we kind of think thats going to be flat we end up being wrong so its really hard to pinpoint and it is what im trying to say there but well keep managing it very closely and keep a close eye on it david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats helpful just one quick follow on to that do you have a sense of how much was from existing clients versus maybe new client that you brought in christopher m merrywell a chief operating officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc no i dont have that right here with me david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon maybe a question just on the environment and how its changed since the merger was announced more on the marks and the assumptions on the accretion from the deal weve seen i guess two columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 21apr2022 questions number one weve seen a lot of banks move securities into held to maturity to avoid the hit to oci i guess first question is is that something with the combination that might be being considered and two how might the marks changing from when the deal was announced impact capital return pro forma thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc well chris this is clint ill start just kind of high level and then ill turn it over to aaron for the actual substance that youre looking for relative to how we think about the deal and the impact of rates and the marks im somewhat indifferent the value that we saw in this combination was really executing on a shared longterm vision and that longterm vision hasnt changed the more that weve gotten into the integration planning the more excited i am about exceeding that vision and i said long term well weve all been at this for the better part of our careers and weve been through multiple business cycles and thats something that as a combined organization we know were going to go through and its just the timing of it our objective here wasnt trying to time a business cycle or beat a rate movement or anything it was the right time for us to consider this combination so what creates some noise in the modeling ill let aaron speak to the work i know aaron and ron and their teams have put a tremendous amount into modeling and analyzing that impact but i just wanted to kind of frame it that i really look at that as kind of a shortterm component of what really is a longterm decision that all of our companies made aaron james deer a chief financial officer executive vice president columbia banking system inc yeah and i would echo with what clint has said on that front about staying focused on the fundamentals but just from the rate impact point i guess the first point out that we did in fact move a good deal of our afs portfolio into held to maturity late last year in anticipation of rising rates and that helped give us a little bit of protection here as rates have started to move going forward i would expect that thered be good rationale for continuing to hold some of that there but more specific to the marks as they will be impacted for the deal well be looking at certain asset categories that would have been coming on at a premium now swinging to a discount thats going to increase the amount of goodwill but as clint indicated thats going to come back to us much faster in the form of net interest income so netnet its an accounting change the fundamentals are not really changed by those interest rate movements christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color thanks aaron operator thank you and there are no other questions this does conclude todays conference call thank you for
