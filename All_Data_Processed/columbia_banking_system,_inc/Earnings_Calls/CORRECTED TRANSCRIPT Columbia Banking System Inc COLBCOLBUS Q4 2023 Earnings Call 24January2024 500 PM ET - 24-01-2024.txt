clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thank you jacque good afternoon everyone was a tremendous year for columbia we closed and integrated our transformational merger with umpqua bank expanding our footprint to encompass eight western states and creating one of the largest banks headquartered in the west we achieved targeted net cost savings ahead of schedule and above our original projections even after taking franchise reinvestment into account with the integration behind us our priorities in and beyond have shifted to focus more fully on optimizing performance and driving shareholder value the fourth quarter was noisy and our results reflect that the fdic special assessment and other elevated expense items brought our quarterly expense run rate above prior guidance our cost of funds reflects the rate environment and the associated impacts of repricing cds and higherpriced funding sources like public deposits and brokered funds while these items mask the quality of our core deposit base they do not dilute it columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 relationship banking drives our franchise value and its the value proposition we bring to new and existing customers our fourth quarter results do not reflect this value and we were focused on improving controllable variables to offset macrodriven headwinds looking to the year ahead the competitive environment for deposits and impact of higher rates is likely to persist and the macro credit environment will likely normalize at minimum we were well situated to benefit during times of stress should they emerge our talented associates scaled franchise and offerings and customerfocused business model provide us with the resources to win business and longterm drive consistent repeatable performance ill now turn the call over to ron ronald l farnsworth executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc okay thank you clint and for those on the call who want to follow along i will be referring to certain page numbers from our earnings presentation slide lays out our  performance ratios knowing the decline in the quarter was driven primarily by the decline in noninterestbearing demand deposits as customers continue to utilize cash higher provision for credit loss based on slightly worsening economic forecasts and higher expense including in the fdic special assessment these are fivequarter views and recall we closed the combination at the end of february slide shows our summary balance sheet noting our deposits in total were flat from  given seasonal inflows primarily on public deposits mostly offset customers use of cash our tangible book value is up as our accumulated other comprehensive loss was halved during the quarter as bond markets rallied on slide we highlight the income statement trends gaap earnings were per share impacted by decline in merger expense as we completed the integration along with fair value changes due to market yield changes on an operating basis we earned per share in  lower than expectations again given noninterest bearing deposit flows higher costs on interestbearing deposits and an increased provision with slightly worse economic forecasts and higher expense given driven primarily by the fdic special assessment which at million reduced gaap and operating eps by per share turning to slide we break out  gaap earnings to help investors understand the nonoperating and merger related impacts on results the first column represents our  gaap results with net income of million or per diluted share and return on tangible common equity of the second column includes our nonoperating designation for income statement changes mostly related to fair value swings along with merger and exit and disposal costs included in noninterest expense which are detailed out in the appendix this net the million of income in  earnings resulting in a third column for operating income again our operating income for  was million or per share and results were impacted by the fdic special assessment and reserve build given again slightly worsening economic forecasts columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 the appendix shows trending on each of these columns and the fourth column includes discount accretion and cdi amortization noting this discount accretion will be a steady and reliable source of interest income over time as the majority is driven by rate not credit providing us with a steady build of capital over time and recall the cdi amortization does not impact tangible book value so the per share net for merger accounting was the equivalent of per share added to tangible book value in  well continue to highlight and trend it here to investors and valuing all our earnings streams our tangible book value excluding aoci increased during the quarter to per share moving to the next section on slide we highlight net interest income and margin our nim declined to for the quarter driven primarily by a higher cost of interestbearing deposits more than offsetting increased loan yields and lower costs from term debt slide breaks out the repricing and maturity characteristics of the loan portfolio noting is fixed is floating and are adjustable now slide provides an updated view of our interest rate sensitivity under both ramp and shock scenarios weve taken proactive measures to reduce the balance sheet sensitivity to a future declining rate environment you can see here the trending over the past year where our rates down risk has been reduced significantly and note that below we calculate our cycle to date funding betas which are calculated on a combined company basis over the periods presented for comparability as of the fourth quarter our interestbearing deposit portfolio has priced in of the fed funds rate increases notable here is the cost of interestbearing deposits which was for  and for the month of december the lift this quarter was influenced by several factors the decision in  to replace a maturing federal home loan bank advances for broker deposits was essentially neutral to the cost of interestbearing liabilities but it drove nearly of the increase in interestbearing deposit cost between  and  approximately of the quarters increase relates to an increase in the average balance and rate paid on public deposits and approximately million in customer cds with largely and 13month terms matured during the quarter with many repricing upwards of basis points higher the cost of interestbearing liabilities normalizes for balance sheet management decisions and the quarters 30basispoint increase was significantly lower than the increase in interestbearing deposit costs cost from interestbearing liabilities was in  compared to for the month of december and as of december slide breaks out noninterest income items wherein the largest changes in  relate to interestrate driven line items the changes in loans held at fair value at the bottom was a direct result of decrease in longterm yields this quarter next up on slide we note we achieved the million in cost synergies guided last quarter exceeding our original target of million by this amount is net of reinvestments made in various areas while we will continue to target efficiency improvements with the integration now largely complete we no longer consider future costsaving opportunities to be merger related  expense was above our previously guided range due to several elevated expense items noted on the right side of the waterfall from the prior quarter with increases driven by higher repairs and maintenance equipment purchases a branding campaign and most notably the million fdic special assessment on slide we introduce our outlook for on several key financial statement items our net interest margin remains sensitive to customer deposit balances with growth driving margin stability and perhaps expansion as we replace wholesale funding and outflows driving contraction our interest rate outlook which incorporates three rate cuts in the back half of the year does not meaningfully impact prepayment assumptions related to purchase columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 accounting our expense outlook incorporates a low singledigit level of growth from q4s adjusted run rate we see areas for efficiency improvement to offset the costs associated with franchise reinvestment and inflation to that end we consolidated five branches this month moving ahead to the next section on the balance sheet on slide we detail out the investment portfolio the table takes you from current par to amortized cost to fair value noting the difference between current par and amortized cost as a combined net discount which will be accreted to interest income over time the increase in market value this quarter of course resulted from lower market yields given the bond market rally again with the unrealized loss halving just over half of the portfolio is now sitting with an unrealized gain at year end which gives us significant flexibility to manage the balance sheet moving forward as you can tell im excited about this portfolio as it gives us significantly higher and stable earnings stream with greater optionality the overall book yield was with an effective duration of years at quarter end slide covers our liquidity including deposit flows during the quarter total deposits were essentially flat in the fourth quarter seasonal and targeted increases in public deposits nearly offset contraction in small business balances as other categories were relatively unchanged the upper right table details our offbalance sheet liquidity with billion available as of quarterend below that we had cash in excess bond collateral now pledged for lines to arrive at total available liquidity of billion slide provides the driver of annualized loan growth in  turning now to slide we present the remaining balance of discount marks as compared to the prior quarter and at closing for the afs portfolio the acquired discount was reduced million via the accretion to interest income in our earnings release detail we include this million along with million of higher bond interest income and the portfolio restructure we completed postclose to arrive at the million of total accretion for bonds on the loan side we had million of rate accretion million for credit the total marks declined million in  through accretion to interest income and finally in the back on slide we highlight our regulatory capital position and our riskbased capital ratios increased basis points as expected in  we do expect to quickly approach our longterm capital target of on total riskbased capital which will provide for enhanced flexibility to return excess capital to shareholders with that i will now turn the call over to frank frank d namdar executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc thank you ron slides through provide select characteristics of our loan portfolio including composition of our commercial book and an overview of our office portfolio which continues to perform well moving on slide highlights our reserve coverage by loan category also the remaining credit discount on loans provides for an additional basis points of loss absorbing capacity the million provision expense recorded in the quarter was primarily driven by a slight worsening in the economic forecast used in the credit models along with credit migration delinquency and nonperforming loan movements over the past two quarters suggest a move toward a more standard credit environment following a phase of exceptional high quality slide provides an overview of our consolidated credit trends in general our credit performance is and has remained positive excluding the anticipated trend in finpac finpac chargeoffs remain elevated during the fourth columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 quarter still centered in the trucking portion of the portfolio we continue to expect a slow recovery timeline over multiple quarters for this portfolio excluding finpac chargeoff activity at the bank remains at a low level i will now turn the call over to tory torran b nixon presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc thank you frank turning to deposits slide highlights the quality of our granular deposit base as ron noted small businesses use of cash drove a reduction in customer deposits during the fourth quarter as other commercial balances and consumer accounts were relatively stable in aggregate the fourth quarter included normal course of business use of cash like distributions dividends and yearend tax payments while public balances experienced a related increase public deposits were positively impacted by targeted efforts by our teams to grow public relationships and local communities as we work to reduce wholesale funding balances our teams remain focused on driving balanced growth in deposits loans and core fee income as they work to expand existing relationships throughout the bank bringing new prospects into the bank we see tremendous opportunity with our existing customer base to grow fee income we launched smart leads in as a way to capture additional business with our existing customer base through predictive analytics we generated an additional million in revenue since with million generated in alone highlighting increased traction with our teams and the benefits of our scaled organization we will continue to selectively invest in talent technology and locations that enable us to profitably expand our businesses as the efficiency opportunities ron noted maintain our dedication to growing in a cost effective manner and lastly our loan deposit and core fee income pipelines remain robust i will now turn the call back over to clint clint e stein president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc okay thanks tory our regulatory capital position is outlined on slide and as ron discussed we expect capital to continue to accrete quickly in the coming quarters providing us with ample flexibility for future shareholder return this concludes our prepared comments and our team is available to answer your questions so valerie please open the call for qa columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions one moment for our first question our first question comes from the line of david feaster raymond james your line is open david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good afternoon everybody clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc hey david david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc i appreciate all the guidance and maybe just talking about starting on the margin and digging into the some of the impacts of rate cuts im curious how you think about the nim trajectory obviously you guys include three cuts in your forecast how do you think about the impact of cuts you guys have ma have done a great job managing the downside in the rate sensitivity scenarios im just curious how you think about the trajectory and of the margin and how quickly youll be able to reprice some of those core deposits on the way down ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah david hey this is ron great question as i look into i mean if that were to come true and we see three rate cuts in the back half of the year or x number of rate changes as the market is predicting really key with that ph if i mean what happens to the deposit betas and then those rates down scenarios i think were pretty conservative in these numbers with betas in the low to mid30 range whereas on the rates up side were now at and we model on rates up so something tells me youre going to see most banks probably be north of their model results on the rates down side just given nature and the fact that deposit moved up so quickly so with that it would suggest that there could be potential upside on it but again under all of it is going to be whats going on with underlying customer deposit flows right so thats still the main driver versus betas i would suggest christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc indiscernible and david this is chris ill add to the rate part of that discussion that between tory myself and our teams we were already looking at the competitive market were looking at where rates are trending i think youll start to see us start moving potentially ahead of any sort of rate cut scenario and putting in place the longterm kind of more plan of if we get a rate cut and pick your month what are we planning to do so all of thats being laid out right now and we should be launching that relatively soon here but yeah just trying to get ahead of that aspect of it and i think you see the market is already kind of moving in that direction so itll just be a matter of historically can we follow or can we lead as weve done in the past and that would be the ideal situation columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and maybe kind of just a followup to some of this just staying on the deposit side in the prepared remarks it was alluded to some of the decline is being attributed to small business declines im curious maybe what are some of the drivers of that from your standpoint obviously theres some seasonality but how much of its activating deposits versus paying down debt using cash to fund growth or just less profitability at this point for some of the small businesses and just curious its early in the first quarter just curious how are you seeing things stabilize and how do you think about core deposit growth going forward christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah you got a lot in there david i would say the uses that you mentioned absolutely youre seeing that completely across the board you are seeing some small businesses that good operators have the ability to increase their prices and things of that nature but for many of them inflation is certainly taking a big impact and that goes across all items from products to service to the employment inputs and things of that nature we move into really kind of more of a seasonality type of situation in the first quarter as well i would say were in contact with the small business customers through our local presence mainly through the branches people are positive but ph theyre also would say looking down the road for when somethings going to take place thats going to provide them some relief we havent seen that quite yet and i think tory can speak to a little bit more on the commercial side there torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah david its tory on the commercial side its pretty kind of typical with the end of the year in  the one difference is you saw people that took they take excess cash that they have in their operating accounts and want to reposition that into some interest bearing account just with kind of a good course of business on their point from their standpoint but its a typical use of cash of dividends distributions tax payments those types of things investments ph at some customers are making investments and doing it with cash instead of borrowing for it so kind of some typical stuff that weve seen in the last year or so christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah and ph david same tory and i talked quite a bit about the momentum thats building and our teams getting excited about being out in the market integrations behind them and were seeing new business start to come on with some of the other things that are going on out there now its coming on at a higher cost than weve seen in the past but were driving those operating accounts were getting the full relationships with the focus and we say tory and myself see stories almost every day about somebody somewhere in the footprint bringing in a new name into the bank david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great thats great and i guess to that point im curious on the ci growth curious where are you having success driving growth how much of its from client acquisition versus increased utilization or deeper relationships or even the new hires that youve made im just curious your appetite for growth and whether youd expect the ci to be the key driver of loan growth going forward columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah david its tory again definitely ci growth as the place that we will grow the lending side of the house with full relationship banking so like we said i think very consistently were in eight western states great markets weve got great people they have very strong pipelines we saw ci growth kind of a mixture between new client acquisition as chris was talking about plus lending to existing customers doing their normal course of business so it was spread throughout the footprint so theres not one place where i can say we got most of our growth it was kind of spread throughout our footprint and as chris said i mean we feel very good about the pipelines and the activity thats occurring out in the field so david p feaster q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats great thanks everybody a thank you david a indiscernible david operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line timur braziler of wells fargo your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon followingup on the net interest income net interest margin commentary just with the expectation for deposits and funding to remain a source of pressure here in the nearterm and then the expectation for rate cuts in the back end of the year is there an outcome where nii inflects and grows in or is that more likely a event ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc well timur this is ron good question and again its going to be really a function of the cost of that deposit growth i could definitely see a scenario where you see a little on the lower end and front end if we do continue to see pressure on noninterest bearing demand specifically within that guide range but then once they start moving again i talked about earlier that deposit beta i think thats pretty conservative and i would suggest unless the regional banks think the model betas on the rates downside theyre going to be close to what they were on the upside so you could see a scenario exactly where you get some pickup in the second half timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then i guess looking at the deposit costs and some of the december spot rates is that a good ceiling here is that kind of where we expect the fundingbased to stall out or is there going to be some more mix columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 shift in the first half of the year to some of these higher cost categories like which could keep that lag around and costs for a little bit longer ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah obviously its an estimate but we would expect the lag to continue there and thats probably why we show the beta todate ph but we model over on the rates up side so you got that additional piece we also have in this past quarter we had about million of cds repricing that to 13month tenor so they have been sitting there for a year and those all repriced up close to basis points in the first quarter i want to say its around million to million of cds maturing which will reprice but will be less than basis points that just given the timing of those compared to when the fed was raising rates earlier in timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and i guess whats the thought process or the rationale for maintaining all of those balances rather than being more aggressive with rates here and letting some of that money walk ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc just overall liquidity levels where we feel comfortable sitting with cash on the balance sheet indiscernible at the fed and keep in mind too i mean weve got an incredible amount of optionality again compared to the average regional bank with little over half of our bond portfolio sitting in unrealized gain but then again too the goal would be to accrete that meaning discount up to par over the life of that book because thats all government rate from that standpoint so weve taken the approach of maintaining that flexibility so we earn back that discount which reduced capital a year back at the combination closing and by utilizing that we utilize overnight or wholesale funding in that two to fourmonth tenor to maintain that overall level liquidity we have reduced the overall level of on balance sheet liquidity where we were sitting up closer to billion early mid2023 indiscernible cash weve now taken that down into the call it ph to range i could see that probably dropping a little bit more in the but probably not too much more timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you ill step back ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thanks operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of brandon king of truist your line is open brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc good afternoon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i wanted to talk about the leaning into those public deposits could you just elaborate on the thought process behind that and if youre able to achieve that just based off rate or indiscernible relationships just give us the puts and takes there torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc hey brandon this is tory so we have a lot of existing customers in the bank that are municipalities spread throughout the footprint most of them are smaller rural communities and there we have strong relationships with them and just made a very significant effort to go out and call on that group and ask for more deposits in the bank and we it says a lot about the capability of the teams both in the branches and in commercial banking to have those relationships and to call on them to further deepen and strengthen those relationships and that was the effort its that time of year as tax payments come in so they have more money and distributed to us what we thought was really good idea christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc and brandon ill add to that as tory mentioned that local presence and working together its not just existing customers and then maybe getting a little bit of a price ph stop on some of that reserve money that can lead you into were talking about full relationships were talking to them about their operating accounts that sales cycle takes a little longer but were already seeing positive momentum into new names that came on board in a money market type of account that are i want to investigate my operating account with you thats when that relationship really gets cemented and that as tory said thats what they do people they live they work in the communities they know the individuals that are at the public entities and theyre building relationships and theyre asking for the business and with our capabilities with the new ph team capabilities that came on board for a lot of our footprint as well were getting looks and were winning that were going to win that business and that momentum is building clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah and its a great funding ph alternative to not on the operating we get the operating account but then with their surplus liquidity we provide an ph alternative to the local government pools and its a way of providing bringing in deposit balances without cannibalizing our core deposit base or repricing the whole sector of our deposit base and so its kind of a different lever that we can pull help creates noise and in my prepared remarks i made a reference to the results of the quarter dont necessarily reflect the quality of our deposit base but thats what i was really getting at is that this is just a lever we can pull and the fall when tax proceeds are coming in for municipalities is a great time to pull that lever brandon king q analyst truist securities inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 got it got it and just my followup would be could you do you care to quantify the level of the amount of public funds deposits you have and would you consider these deposits higher beta relative to maybe some of your more core deposits a yeah torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc i think you have to bifurcate it because we do have the operating relationship with virtually all of these public entities and so thats going to behave more like a traditional part of our portfolio and then you have the what i referenced as an alternative to the local government pools and so i think rons got the detail youre looking for ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah we do highlight that in those trends on page of the earnings presentation but in total billion of total public deposits and that was up roughly billion a little under billion for the quarter and of that youre going to be probably in the ph range would be the core operating accounts probably tops but a good stable base brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay and just lastly ron i know youre working to kind of reduce asset sensitivity just given the full rate curve and the potential for rates to come down are there any actions that youre considering or looking at that would make sense at this point to achieve that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah great question its really difficult on the derivative side just given pricing and expectations but we took that shot and we did that you can see the trending there too on page of the presentation with how we repositioned the portion of the bond portfolio in that first week post close back in  and then also utilization of shorterterm wholesale funding we had the broker deposits or home loan bank advances to help offset the deposit flows during the year those two items in and of themselves basically act as a like a swap benefits you in rate down because youre locked out cash flows on the bond portfolio and youll have fully floating down cash flows on the right side of the balance sheet so that was really the majority of the change from a year back to now where in the past year back we had a more traditional asset sensitivity profile and today were relatively neutral brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 yeah thank you clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc thanks operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty of kbw your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks for the question ron maybe on your expense guide for a minute the billion or billion what im interested in your comments on what the revenue environment would be at different points of that guide ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good question chris generally the historically the movement on the expense side directly tied to revenue would have to do with home lending back in a different much lower rate environment right you see seasonality over the course of the year which would drive higher revenue in the second and third quarter lower seasonal in first and fourth youd have corresponding expense trends along the lines id say our outlook here is not for significant rates down ph world to where home lending is picking up significantly in volumes so its going to be really range bound within that nim is going to be the driver of the revenue side and i think over the course of the year ex any legacy home lending seasonality youre generally going to see higher payroll taxtype items in the first two quarters of the year and then those tail off in the second two quarters of the year you also generally see annual merit cycles which basically approximates inflation rates at the start of the second quarter so you see a little bit of a lift and then stabilization over the course of the year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful thank you and clint maybe on capital you noted in the release tier of is about your target and your total is within basis points could you help us on when the buyback would be more of a discussion or announcement is it when you hit you have to build a buffer to how are you thinking about the buyback given the outlook clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah i think that i mean is kind of like the fed trying stick the ph lending on the economy its difficult to just get to and keep it there and so i think that wed want a little bit of a buffer before we implemented the buyback probably not a huge buffer but enough that we could do a meaningful buyback and still be above after you took that into account columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 so i know im not giving you like hard and fast timeline or number but we do see and you can see the trend over the last three quarters of how capital builds there are some things as the rate environment we do get three cuts i think that that gives us some additional optionality even over and above what we already have on our balance sheet some flexibility that can put us in a position to do a buyback sooner than later what were probably really talking is a one quarter or two quarters before we would do it just naturally through steady state with the bps bps of capital accretion each quarter christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats helpful and then just a followup would that be the top use of capital beyond growing your business that youve talked about or is there an alternative use i know you have dividend thats pretty competitive but inorganic growth at all on the table clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah the regular dividend obviously is something that we have talked about that we want to be consistent and provide that and for some of our investors thats a its a very important component of their investment in our company the organic growth component of it tory mentioned in his prepared remarks the pipelines and ive had the opportunity to meet with some of our market leaders over the past days and when they talk about what their pipelines look like and the opportunities they have in front of them from a business perspective many of you have seen ron in person when he talks about the bond portfolio and he just gets giddy thats the same type of reaction that our bankers have with the opportunities that theyre currently in the middle of pursuing but even with that said i think the capital generation is so strong that any level of reasonable organic growth i dont think it outstrips the building of those ratios between the regular dividend organic growth and so it does leave us with buyback options potentially depending on if buybacks were didnt make sense then we could always look at whether a special dividend makes sense and then to your question inorganic growth i think that were it feels like were in a time period like we were in mid2020 where the ma markets are kind of frozen the math is very hard right now i know theres been a few things announced but those arent healthy thriving franchises that would be of interest to us we dont feel like that itd be additive to our longterm value but that will change with the passage of time and so i do think that theres going to be some opportunities to at least look at things but as weve said before the size company we are the eight states that were in theres not a plethora of opportunities that move the needle for us so wed be very selective and disciplined about looking at any type of inorganic opportunities christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for all the color appreciate it operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson your line is open columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon wanted to clarify is it safe to assume a loan growth expectation would mirror your balance sheet growth expectation of no growth to or possibly outstrip that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc hey jeff this is ron good afternoon good question and yeah i mean ideally over time you want the deposit growth to match the loan growth and thats our goal here over the course of jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so loan growth that maybe no growth i want to kind of pair that up clint with kind of the field and that getting us out there is there a point where youre kind of tamping down your kind of loan officers on hey we got to true it up with deposit growth im just trying to get the assumptions underlying of a pretty limited growth and kind of meet that with kind of the team and youre going on the anniversary of the merger close just want to kind of get the sense for feet under those folks and starting to produce you know pretty significant net growth clint e stein a president chief executive officer director columbia banking system inc yeah its a great question it gets back to the response i had on inorganic growth and when we think about there weve talked for the last couple of quarters about being relationshipcentric and in a qttype environment where were holding back and being very restrained is on transactional real estatetype things our ci teams small business bankers i mean theyve got a green light and the ability to go out but i dont think theres a single banker in this company that doesnt that and i use the term banker purposely we dont have lenders we have bankers and that they need to go get the full relationship needs to come with deposits and theyre not going to fund dollar for dollar i mean thats not the nature of it but thats why we have our robust strong retail network to help with the funding but thats where i think the optimism is the integrations behind us weve shut down the integration management office and theyre ready theyre on the their front foot theyre ready to go play offense and tory i dont know if you have anything to add torran b nixon a presidentcommercial banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah jeff its tory i would just maybe reiterate a little bit of clints comments around just the salesforce and the bankers in the footprint their strong desire to grow market share to really to manage what we have and keep what we have and continue to expand with what we have but to grow market share and that sometimes is a relationship that includes a loan and sometimes its a relationship where theres no lending activity a deposit only or deposit and core fee income relationship is very valuable and supports this local presence that chris always talks about and this ability to grow their book of business and our focus is definitely on the ci side of the house and as you could see in the growth in real estate its been its flattened and on purpose and were pushing on the ci front and so weve got a lot of great bankers in great markets that are out pounding the pavement and looking to bring in new names into the bank columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co appreciate it wanted to maybe hop over the credit side of things and really kind of looking at that kind of the ph crosshairs going to finpac thinking about i think midlast year we were kind of pointing to maybe it was hopeful or some signs forming that those trucking losses would ph add lower it looks like were bouncing back up and i guess kind of over the course of if you think about losses in finpac is it safe to assume we could still be in that to for the full year or do you see any trend that we could kind of come off a cliff with that frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah hey jeff yeah i do not expect that this trend goes all through i mean if we look at the loss curves and really the vintages that have caused this pain the vintages were really the last half of and all of from a loss curve perspective were through all of and were about halfway through so i believe we will see at the end of the second quarter those losses start to tail off at a more rapid way than they have historically and dont forget i mean the fourth quarter is a tough barometer for collecting because of all the holidays that are during that quarter and in this space i mean remember i mean finpac is it may be a subsidiary of the bank and provides a valuable product set for the bank but at its core its still a finance company in a finance company this type of activity and what were seeing currently is not abnormal and if you go out there and survey our competitors theyre experiencing the exact same thing even at a worse clip than we are what is encouraging is that it is isolated to the trucking portfolio and we do see the light through the data that we have that there is an end in sight and i do believe itll be halfway through this year jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it just to kind of get into that vintage and i appreciate the color there frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co that the thought that as we moved into the back half of and hopeful of a decline was it that you got into some of those vintages that were like oh wow this is also troublesome is that why sort of the extended frank d namdar a executive vice president chief credit officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean and were coming out of and we did see that was also displaying some of the elevated loss characteristics and so we kind of had a feeling that it would it would be a long drag out process for getting back to that clip but we do see it in the early returns i will tell you for the vintage theyre very columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 positive so that is encouraging that the tweaks that weve made to the model and the criteria really in the portfolio as a whole but in particular the trucking portfolio is really seems to be paying off in the vintage jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great thank you and then one last one ron ill take another crack i didnt really response on the margin trajectory i know it resides with deposit success but i guess to put it more clearly you expect more compression in the first half of versus the second half when you layer on potential rate cuts your basis points of cuts ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc thats correct just given the fact that weve got that conservative estimate in there for the deposit betas and that will really be a driver of if we do see the rates down environment i expect well outperform and i expect our betas will be above the on the down i mean theyre closer to like i said earlier to on the up overriding all of that of course will be whats going on with just basic customer deposit flows and you heard enough conversation on that point today so well see how it plays out jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co if were talking million million for the full year you may shoot to that midyear and then its kind of a coming up is sort of how you would trend line that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc in that view over the course of the year you saw a couple of rate cuts in the second half of the year and we like most banks expect that ph it will overperform on our deposit betas to the rates downside and yeah thats true statement jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc jeff thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of brody preston of ubs your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good evening everyone ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 good afternoon brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc ron i just wanted to ask a few questions on nii the billion of loans that you have above floors do you happen to know where those flow rates are ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc theyre sitting more than three cuts down brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc well have that detail into the next quarters release but theyre definitely more than three cuts down brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc all right would they be more than the forward curve down the five or maybe six depending on the day ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i dont have that in front of my hands but again recall going back over the last two yearandahalf two years as rates were increasing it was easily more than what six cuts would be ph bps is easily more than bps ago that we started to slow down talking about loans are going above their floors brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay i noticed that you shifted some of the borrowing base to btfp this quarter i think it was maybe million of utilization you still got a lot of fhlb lines and if im remembering correctly those are pretty short from a duration perspective i think theres like an 80somethingbasispoint gap between the cost of your borrowings right now and what btfp is would you consider shifting the rest of the borrowings to btfp to help with the margin and if so is that contemplated in your guidance at all ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc we are looking at that its not the full amount of the home loan bank advances just given the capacity at the btfp but we are looking at that here over the course of the first quarter brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great so if i look at the nii sensitivity slide that you all provide it looks like in either up and down and kind of scenario its negative for nii and all but a couple of them as of december and then i columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 dont think you have a lot in fixed asset repricing so if we got no cuts maybe that kind of incremental deposit beta creep and lag that youve talked about would continue so i guess im struggling a little bit ron to think about holistically like what whats the best rate environment that you could foresee just kind of looking at those pieces of the puzzle ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean interesting question i would suggest this that in anyones interest rate risk modeling if theyre looking at the difference between and and saying theres exact precision in that theyre not being truthful with you right theres so many assumptions that go into that over the course of the year inclusive of customer deposit flows betas timing lags so i kind of look at all those as relatively neutral within their if theyre within a point or two of each other just because i know thats generally the ph great range youre going to be facing over the course of the year brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and what is the nib mix thats contemplated within your nii guidance im sorry if i missed that ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc within the traditional nii guidance or interest rate sensitivity analysis which is what this is you generally assume a static balance sheet and then things reprice into themselves so again thats where i got to earlier talking about within the range of the guide if were better on the deposit side then were going to be on the upper end if were not were going to be on the lower end brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then last one for me just if i take the pieces of your of your guidance billion of average earning assets on the margin and then you factor in the expenses if i do something just like last three quarters average fee income assume thats the run rate annualize it and grow it by low to midsingle digit it kind of implies like ph mid on ppnr am i far off the mark there ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc brody i dont have the calculator out in front of me to run through that math with you id just ask were not providing the inputs in the guidance on eps were not giving an eps guide but theres other maybe specific questions that might help you on the modeling side i highly suggest contacting jacque shes great and shell set you straight brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for taking my questions everyone columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc you bet thank you operator one moment please our next question comes from the line of matthew clark of piper sandler your line is open matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks for the questions and brody ph sounds thats kind of where i am right now first question just on expenses relative to the balance sheet size if we end up at the low end of that average earning asset range the billion i believe is it fair to assume that noninterest expenses will be at the low end as well billion versus billion ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc theres potential for that obviously we have efficiency improvements that were working through as well but theres also just enough uncertainty when you look into the year inclusive of inflation rates to say our target is going be somewhere relatively in the middle of that and theres downside theres upside and see which way it plays over the year but we wanted to just make sure we recognize that there is some level of uncertainty to timing and flow over the course of the year so not giving a specific guide on that by quarter or the trajectory matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co im just trying to be consistent with the balance sheet size relative to expenses should we be consistent or not ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc there is a little bit of movement with the balance sheet size but again you also have changes in say for example deferred loan costs which are influenced by the balance sheet size or we get leverage within deposits per branch which doesnt necessarily have an impact on expenses other than incentives so its just difficult to say with precision at this point matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co understood okay and then just the stepup in other noninterest expense i think it went from excluding merger charges so call it i dont know million and change million million up from million last quarter anything unusual in there that we should strip out going forward im just trying to get a sense for ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah no good question i take a look at slide again jacque did a great job showing the movement in the bridge and a good chunk of those items inclusive of the fdic special assessment but a good chunk of those items are elevated and not expected to continue at those levels columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co yeah i know the fdic thats obvious but im talking about in the merger were stripping all that out im just talking about anything else beyond fdic and merger charges ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean you look through again on that bridge on slide youll see some items related to small equipment repairs and maintenance something more on the occupancy and equipment area but then you got legal title and other those are in the other area so lets try to call those out on the bridge matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay got it okay fair enough and then back on the deposit beta outlook for kind of the remainder of the cycle did i hear you correctly that youre expecting the cumulative interestbearing deposit beta to get to at the peak is that what i heard ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc that is what our models would suggest but then again recognize that those are models matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co understood okay just want to make i heard that and then just on the provision i mean its obviously a moving target in any given quarter but it looks like a decent stepup in reserve build here and i understand classified increased a little bit but not meaningfully i think most macro models actually improved this quarter so im a little surprise in the stepup in reserve build relative to the migration in the macro but how should we think about provisioning going forward and is this a somewhat outsized you think or not were going to assume higher chargeoffs just with normalization but im trying to get a sense for kind of reserve coverage and whether or not this provision might be a little elevated ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean good question i guess in terms of the models and the slightly worsened economic forecast i mean there are dozens of variables that go into cecl models not simply just gdp or cpi rates you also have things along the lines of vacancy rates or rent changes within various markets that we operate which factor into those so i would characterize it as just in total across again those dozens of variables they were just a little bit worse but that just means they were a little bit better a quarter ago and theyre all a guess right theyre all projections which we factor in the model from that standpoint so underlying trends though id refer back to franks comments earlier right we do expect well see some abatement on the finpac side and then the rest is going to be whats going on with the overall economy two or three quarters from now and then more interestingly of those forecasts looking ahead over the life of the portfolio at those points in time so columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i have more specifics for you on that but thats what were dealing with matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co understood okay and then sounds good ill leave it there thank you ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah thank you operator thank you one moment please our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets your line is open jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good afternoon ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc good afternoon jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey just most of my questions have been asked and answered but on slide the red bar on deposit pricing its kind of looking at that over the last couple of quarters and ron what do you think that bar looks like in the first and second quarter i know theres a lot that goes into it but i guess its this this rate of change in deposit pricing and im just if you could take a stab at what you think that looks like over the next couple of quarters that might help ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah look i mean good question i would refer back to we do disclose in here the spot rates as of yearend so use that as your starting point for when you look into  but i also say that the bps change as delivered in the walk on page was really a good chunk of that was related to the decision we made back in late in  where we brought on broker deposits to help just home loan bank advances which are in the borrowings category right so i wouldnt expect as big of a move but again it depends on what we do with those balances over the course of the year but that was really a good chunk of the driver there of that about bps in  columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc now thats specific to interestbearing deposits i talked about though we saw in interestbearing liabilities it wasnt as big of a change and thats just because of a shift from a little bit higher cost borrowings and to similar cuts in broker deposits jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay okay yeah that was kind of my next question i wanted to ask about funding cost peaking and i think you may be saying youre reasonably close on that is that fair ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc yeah i mean we give models right but lets also assume generally a twoquarter lag on the back end of that christopher m merrywell a presidentconsumer banking of umpqua bank columbia banking system inc yeah jon this is chris and as i mentioned earlier in the call hey jon this is chris as i mentioned earlier in the call were starting to see the market pull back a little bit so i think towards are we at the peak we cant tell you that i dont know it appears that were were somewhere there i would expect it to start slowing down from what we experienced in the previous quarters and some of the that are coming due on the cd side theres not as big of a lift between their current rate and where we project we might be in a month or two so all that being said i think the pace is going to certainly slow down and well see what everybody does out there its a fluid market as well so but pace should slow down jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay ron one more crack at the most annoying question of the call but the margin trajectory is it safe to assume the way it sits right now with your guide ushape jshape type margin for with kind of a midyear trough is that fair ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc i think again assumptions around that are going to be around timing and number of cuts and where the betas are but underlying all of it is going to be where core customer deposit flows so just not prepared to give a guide in terms of what that looks like by quarter were giving you an estimate of what we feel it could for the full year from our target standpoint jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough thank you columbia banking system inc colb corrected transcript  earnings call 24jan2024 ronald l farnsworth a executive vice president chief financial officer columbia banking system inc all right thank you jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah operator thank you im showing no further questions at this time let me turn the call back over
