sector actions to address covid trade agreements the uncertainty of the results of monetary and fiscal policies the impact of elevated levels of sovereign and state debt capital market disruptions changes in demand and pricing for new and used equipment and geopolitical events significant fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates and volatility in the price of many commodities could also impact john deeres and the companys results the future financial effects of covid are unknown due to many factors as a result predicting the companys forecasted financial performance is difficult and subject to many assumptions in the face of the ongoing challenges associated with managing the global pandemic john deere was able to complete a successful year and is positioned to continue providing differentiated solutions for customers john deere expects to benefit from improving conditions in the farm economy and stabilization in construction and forestry markets covid effects and actions during the effects of covid and the related actions of governments and other authorities to contain covid have affected the companys operations results cash flows and forecasts the companys first priority in addressing the effects of covid continues to be the health safety and overall welfare of its employees the company effectively activated previously established business continuity plans and proactively implemented health and safety measures at its operations around the world the economic effects of covid have reduced customer demand for some of john deeres products and services particularly construction and forestry equipment which resulted in lower shipment volumes during most of all of john deeres factories have operated some at reduced capacity due to component shortages or lower demand as a result the companys acquisition volume of wholesale receivables decreased during however the companys acquisition volume of receivables and leases excluding wholesale was slightly higher in when compared to the company worked closely with its customers including john deere dealers and retail customers during and as necessary provided shortterm relief on obligations owed to the company in response to the economic effects of covid on customers the relief was provided in regional programs and on a casebycase basis with customers that were generally current in their payment obligations for retail customers the relief generally included payment deferrals of three months or less and primarily related to construction accounts the relief provided to dealers generally included payment deferrals of three months or less and shortterm interest rate reductions in certain markets and primarily related to agriculture and turf dealers the receivables and leases granted relief represented approximately percent of the receivable and lease portfolio at november see notes and compared with the total revenues and net income attributable to the company were as follows in millions of dollars table start total revenues net income attributable to the company table end total revenues decreased in due to lower financing rates partially offset by a higher average portfolio net income in was about the same as in with lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values and income from a higher average portfolio largely offset by a higher provision for credit losses and unfavorable financing spreads the net income was also affected by favorable discrete adjustments to the provision for income taxes revenues the finance income and lease revenues earned by the company were as follows in millions of dollars table start change finance income earned from retail notes revolving charge accounts wholesale receivables lease revenues table end finance income on retail notes increased slightly in due to higher average portfolio partially offset by lower average financing rates finance income on revolving charge accounts decreased in primarily due to lower average financing rates while finance income on wholesale receivables decreased due to lower average financing rates and lower average portfolio the increase in lease revenues was primarily due to higher lease payments higher compensation from john deere on operating leases and higher average portfolio balances revenues earned from john deere totaled million in compared with million in the decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation paid by john deere for waived or reduced finance charges on wholesale receivables due to lower average financing rates and lower average portfolio revenues earned from john deere are included in the revenue amounts discussed above and in other income on the statement of consolidated income expenses significant expenses incurred by the company were as follows in millions of dollars table start change interest expense administrative and operating expenses provision for credit losses depreciation of equipment on operating leases provision for income taxes table end the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower average borrowing rates the decrease in administrative and operating expenses was primarily due to lower impairments and reduced losses on operating lease residual values partially offset by foreign exchange losses and higher employeeseparation expenses the provision for credit losses increased primarily due to an increase in the allowance for credit losses and higher net writeoffs of retail notes the provision for credit losses as a percentage of the total average balance of receivables financed was percent for and percent for the depreciation of equipment on operating leases increased primarily due to updated depreciation estimates and higher average balances of equipment on operating leases the higher provision for income taxes in was primarily related to favorable discrete tax adjustments in the prior year as well as a higher effective tax rate and higher pretax income in the current year see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information receivables and leases acquired and held for the fiscal years ended november and november receivable and lease excluding wholesale acquisition volumes and balances held were as follows in millions of dollars table start fiscal year volumes fiscal year end balances change change retail notes agriculture and turf construction and forestry total retail notes revolving charge accounts financing leases equipment on operating leases total receivables and leases excluding wholesale table end retail notes bearing fixed finance rates totaled approximately percent of the total retail note portfolio at november and november total receivables days or more past due nonperforming receivables and the allowance for credit losses were as follows in millions of dollars and as a percentage of the receivables balance table start dollars percent dollars percent receivables days or more past due nonperforming receivables allowance for credit losses table end the delinquency status of receivables granted relief due to covid is based on the modified payment schedule see note receivables days or more past due continue to accrue finance income the company ceases to accrue finance income once receivables are considered nonperforming an allowance for credit losses is recorded for the estimated uncollectible amount the allowance for credit losses is subject to an ongoing evaluation based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical net loss experience by product category portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions in the companys major markets and geographies commodity price trends and credit risk quality the company believes its allowance is sufficient to provide for losses inherent in its existing receivable portfolio see note for additional information related to the allowance for credit losses deposits withheld from dealers and merchants representing mainly the aggregate dealer retail note and lease withholding accounts from individual john deere dealers to which losses from retail notes and leases originating from the respective dealers can be charged amounted to million at november compared with million at november compared with the comparison of the results with can be found under the heading compared with in the managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of the companys s with the sec offbalancesheet arrangements the company had other miscellaneous contingencies at november that were not material and for which it believes the probability for payment is substantially remote the company had no accrued liability at november related to these contingencies aggregate contractual obligations the payment schedule for the companys contractual obligations at november in millions of dollars is as follows table start less than more than total year years years years onbalancesheet total debt interest relating to debt accounts payable deposits withheld from dealers and merchants operating leases offbalancesheet purchase obligations total table end principal payments payments related to securitization borrowings of million classified as shortterm on the balance sheet related to the securitization of retail notes are included in this table based on the expected payment schedule see note includes projected payments related to interest rate swaps the previous table does not include unrecognized tax benefit liabilities of approximately million at november since the timing of future payments is not reasonably estimable at this time see note it also does not include unused commitments to extend credit to customers and john deere dealers as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding shortterm borrowings and longterm borrowings see notes and respectively to the consolidated financial statements critical accounting policies the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses changes in these estimates and assumptions could have a significant effect on the financial statements the accounting policies below are those management believes are the most critical to the preparation of the companys financial statements and require the most difficult subjective or complex judgments the companys other accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents an estimate of the losses inherent in the companys receivable portfolio the level of the allowance is based on many quantitative and qualitative factors including historical net loss experience by product category portfolio duration delinquency trends economic conditions in the companys major markets and geographies commodity price trends and credit risk quality the company has an established process to calculate a range of possible outcomes and determine the adequacy of the allowance the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly by product category different assumptions or changes in economic conditions would result in changes to the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses the total allowance for credit losses at november november and october was million million and million respectively the allowance increase in was primarily due to the negative economic effects related to covid and other macroeconomic issues which have significantly affected certain retail borrowers particularly of construction equipment see note the allowance decreased in due primarily to decreases in loss experience the assumptions used in evaluating the companys exposure to credit losses involve estimates and significant judgment the historical loss experience on the receivable portfolios represents one factor used in determining the allowance for credit losses compared to the average loss experience over the last five fiscal years this percent has varied by an average of approximately plus or minus percent holding other factors constant if this estimated loss experience on the receivable portfolio were to increase or decrease percent the allowance for credit losses at november would increase or decrease by approximately million operating lease residual values the carrying value of the equipment on operating leases is affected by the estimated fair values of the equipment at the end of the lease residual values upon termination of the lease the equipment is either purchased by the lessee or sold to a third party in which case the company may record a gain or a loss for the difference between the estimated residual value and the sale price the estimated residual values are based on several factors including lease term expected hours of usage historical wholesale sales prices return experience intended equipment use market dynamics and trends and dealer residual guarantees the company reviews residual value estimates during the lease term and tests carrying value of its operating leases when events or circumstances necessitate changes in residual value assumptions would affect the amount of depreciation expense and the amount of investment in equipment on operating leases the total operating lease residual values at november november and october were million and million and million respectively estimates used in determining end of lease market values for equipment on operating leases significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense hypothetically if future market values for this equipment were to decrease percent from the companys present estimates the total impact would be to increase the companys annual depreciation for equipment on operating leases by approximately million
