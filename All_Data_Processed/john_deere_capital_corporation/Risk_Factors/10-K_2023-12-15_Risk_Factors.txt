item risk factors the results of our operations are affected by our relationships with john deere see our relationships with john deere for additional information regarding our relationships with john deere the following risks are considered material to our business based upon current knowledge information and assumptions this discussion of risk factors should be considered closely in conjunction with managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations mda including the risks and uncertainties described in the forwardlooking statements the notes to consolidated financial statements and the risk factors of deere company included in exhibit to this annual report on form 10k and incorporated herein by reference these risk factors and other forwardlooking statements relate to future events expectations trends and operating periods they involve certain factors that are subject to change and important risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially although the risks are organized by headings and each risk is discussed separately many are interrelated the risks described in this annual report on form 10k and the forwardlooking statements in this report are not the only risks we face strategic risks our profitability and the financial condition of our operations are dependent upon the operations of john deere our volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products the results of our operations are affected by our relationship with john deere including among other items the terms on which we acquire receivables and borrow funds from john deere the reimbursement for interest waiver and lowrate finance programs from john deere the compensation paid by john deere in connection with our purchase of trade receivables from john deere and the payment to john deere for various expenses applicable to our operations in addition we have joint access to certain lines of credit with john deere if there were significant changes in the production or sales of john deere products the quality or resale value of john deere equipment john deeres liquidity capital position debt ratings and access to capital markets the reputation of john deere or high inflation higher interest rates supply chain constraints or other factors impacting john deere or its products such changes could significantly affect our profitability financial condition and access to capital markets in addition if there were changes to sales incentive programs offered by john deere to retail customers in which we receive reimbursement for interest waiver and lowrate finance programs this could decrease our market share of john deere financed equipment volumes and profitability we may be impacted by general negative economic conditions and outlook causing weakened demand for john deeres equipment and services limiting access to funding and resulting in higher funding costs for us and john deere the demand for john deeres and our products and services depends on the fundamentals in the markets in which we operate and can be significantly reduced in an economic environment characterized by high unemployment high interest rates cautious consumer spending inflation lower corporate earnings and lower business investment negative or uncertain economic conditions that cause john deeres customers to lack confidence in the general economic outlook can significantly reduce their likelihood of purchasing john deeres equipment these economic events adversely affected and may continue to adversely affect john deere and our operations sustained negative economic conditions and outlook also affect housing starts energy prices and demand and other construction which dampens demand for certain construction equipment john deeres turf operations and its construction and forestry segments are dependent on construction activity and have also been affected by recent adverse economic conditions decreases in construction activity and housing starts could have a material adverse effect on john deeres and our results of operations if negative economic conditions affect the overall farm economy there could be a similar effect on john deeres agricultural equipment sales uncertain or negative outlook with respect to pervasive us fiscal issues as well as general economic conditions and outlook such as market volatility and continuing interest rate increases by the federal reserve have caused and could continue to cause significant changes in market liquidity conditions such changes could impact access to funding and associated funding costs which could reduce our earnings and cash flows john deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its smart industrial operating model and leap ambitions john deeres failure to realize the anticipated benefits of its smart industrial operating model and related business strategies in production systems precision technologies and aftermarket support could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition based on our dependence on john deere operations several factors could impact john deeres ability to successfully execute the smart industrial operating model including among other things failure to accurately assess market opportunities and the technology required to address such opportunities failure to develop and introduce new technologies or lack of adoption of such technologies by john deeres customers and failure to holistically provide lifecycle solutions in addition if john deere is unable to optimize its capital allocation in connection with the smart industrial operating model including capital allocation for the development and delivery of financial solutions we provide we and john deere may not be able to realize the full benefits of the smart industrial operating model which could have an adverse effect on john deeres and our financial condition and results of operations similarly john deere may not realize the anticipated benefits of its leap ambitions and related goals in the expected timelines or at all as part of the leap ambitions john deere adopted various goals it expects to achieve by or john deere may not be able to achieve these goals for a variety of reasons some of which may be out of its control for example john deeres estimates and assumptions related to efficiency of its products and the adoption of precision technology may not be accurate certain materials such as quality battery cells and cameras may become unavailable or too costly or infrastructure required to achieve its goals such as sufficient charging stations or fuel availability may become too costly or may not be developed on the expected timeline the actual or perceived failure of john deere to achieve its leap ambitions could negatively impact its ability to execute the smart industrial operating model john deere may face risks associated with international national and regional trade laws regulations and policies and government farm programs and policies which could significantly impair john deeres profitability and growth prospects as our volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products these macroeconomic drivers could also negatively impact our profitability and growth prospects international national and regional laws regulations and policies directly or indirectly related to or restricting the import and export of john deeres products services and technology or those of its customers or for the benefit of favored industries or sectors could harm john deeres global business john deeres profitability and growth prospects are tied directly to the global marketplace restricted access to global markets could impair john deeres ability to export goods and services from its various manufacturing locations around the world and could limit the ability to access raw materials and highquality parts and components at competitive prices on a timely basis trade restrictions negotiation of new trade agreements nontariff trade barriers local content requirements and imposition of new or retaliatory tariffs against certain countries or covering certain products including developments in uschina trade relations export control and sanctions against russia have limited and could continue to limit john deeres ability to capitalize on current and future growth opportunities in international markets these trade restrictions and changes in or uncertainty surrounding global trade policies may affect john deeres competitive position furthermore trade restrictions could impede those in developing countries from achieving a higher standard of living which could negatively impact john deeres future growth opportunities arising from increasing global demand for food fuel and infrastructure policies impacting exchange rates and commodity prices or those limiting the export or import of commodities could have a material adverse effect on the international flow of agricultural and other commodities that may result in a corresponding negative effect on the demand for agricultural and forestry equipment in many areas of the world john deeres agricultural equipment sales could be harmed by such policies because farm income influences sales of agricultural equipment around the world additionally changes in government farm programs and policies can influence demand for agricultural equipment as well as create unequal competition for multinational companies relative to domestic companies we may be unable to manage increasing political economic and social uncertainty in certain regions of the world which could significantly change the dynamics of john deeres and our competition customer base and product offerings globally john deeres efforts to grow its business depends in part upon access and developing market shared and profitability in additional geographic markets including but not limited to argentina brazil china india and south africa in some cases these countries have greater political and economic volatility greater vulnerability to infrastructure and labor disruptions and differing customer product preferences and requirements than john deeres other markets in fiscal as a result of the war in ukraine john deere suspended shipments of machines and service parts to russia the suspension of shipments to russia reduced actual and forecasted revenue for the region among other impacts having business operations in various regions and countries exposes us and john deere to multiple and potentially conflicting business practices and legal and regulatory requirements that are subject to change these practices and legal requirements are often complex and difficult to navigate including those related to tariffs and trade regulations investments property ownership rights taxation repatriation of earnings and advanced technologies expanding business operations globally also increases exposure to currency fluctuations which can materially affect our financial results while john deere maintains a positive corporate image and its brands are widely recognized and valued in its traditional markets the brands are less known in some emerging markets which could impede john deeres efforts to successfully compete in these markets john deere may be affected by changing worldwide demand for food and different forms of renewable energy which could impact the price of farm commodities and consequently the demand for john deere equipment this could result in higher research and development costs related to changing machine fuel requirements changing worldwide demand for farm outputs to meet the worlds growing food and renewable energy demands driven in part by government policies including those related to climate change and a growing world population are likely to result in fluctuating agricultural commodity prices which directly affect sales of agricultural equipment lower agricultural commodity prices directly affect farm incomes which could negatively affect sales of agricultural equipment and result in higher credit losses while higher commodity prices benefit john deeres cropproducing agricultural equipment customers they could result in greater feed costs for livestock and poultry producers which in turn may result in lower levels of equipment purchased by these customers in addition changing renewable energy demands may cause farmers to change the types or quantities of the crops they raise with corresponding changes in equipment demand finally changes in governmental policies regulating biofuel utilization could affect commodity demand and commodity prices demand for john deeres dieselfueled equipment and result in higher research and development costs for john deere related to equipment fuel standards these changes could have a negative effect on our results john deeres ability to understand its customers preferences and requirements and to develop manufacture and market products that meet customer demand could significantly affect its business results john deeres ability to match new product offerings to global customers preferences for different types and sizes of equipment and various equipment features and functionality at affordable prices is critical to its success in addition our ability to anticipate and deliver on customers changing preferences for financial solutions is critical to our success this requires a thorough understanding of john deeres and our existing and potential customers on a global basis particularly in growth markets such as argentina brazil and india failure to deliver quality products that meet customer needs at competitive prices ahead of competitors could have a significant adverse effect on john deeres and our business in addition customer preferences in the markets served by john deere are changing as a result of ongoing social and regulatory focus on sustainability as these markets transition to less carbonintensive business models as regulations and social pressure drive change john deere must continue to proactively monitor trends and develop alternatives and enhancements that elevate and complement its product offerings for example even though john deere plans to offer electric hybridelectric and battery electric equipment solutions john deere may be unable to keep up with the rising demand for electric agriculture turf and construction equipment the development of alternative farming techniques carbon sequestration technologies and new lowcarbon biofuels are changing farmers business models and equipment needs if john deere fails to continue to develop or invest in emerging technologies to meet changing customer demands john deere will be at risk of losing potential sources of revenue which could affect john deeres and our future financial results john deeres and our ability to adapt in highly competitive markets could affect our business results of operations and financial condition john deere operates in a variety of highly competitive global and regional markets with other manufacturers and distributors that produce and sell similar products in addition john deeres industry is attracting nontraditional competitors including technologyfocused companies and startup ventures john deere competes on product performance innovation and quality distribution sustainability customer service and price aggressive pricing or other strategies pursued by competitors unanticipated product or manufacturing delays or john deeres failure to price its products competitively could adversely affect john deeres business results of operations and financial condition which could negatively affect our results the equipment finance industry in which we operate is highly competitive we compete for customers with commercial banks and finance and leasing companies based upon service finance rates charged and other finance terms in addition the competitive landscape is evolving as technology is unlocking new capabilities for traditional competitors and enabling new digital entrants our ability to maintain and expand our market share is contingent upon us offering competitive pricing developing and maintaining strong relationships with dealers and customers making substantial investments in our technological infrastructure and effectively responding to changes in the agriculture and turf equipment and construction and forestry equipment markets in addition any expansion into new markets may require us to compete with more experienced and established market participants failure to effectively manage these challenges could adversely affect our market share and pressure to provide competitive pricing could have a negative effect on our results of operations and financial condition john deere relies on a network of independent dealers to manage the distribution of its products and services if dealers are unsuccessful with their sales and business operations it could have an adverse effect on overall john deere sales and revenue john deere relies on the capability of john deere dealers to develop and implement effective sales plans to create demand among purchasers for the equipment and related products and services that the dealers purchase from john deere if john deeres dealers are unsuccessful in these endeavors john deere will be unable to grow its sales and revenue which would have an adverse effect on john deeres and our financial condition in addition the dealer channels ability to support and service precision technology solutions and emerging power solutions may affect customers acceptance and adoption rates of these products the unavailability of specialized technicians to service john deeres equipment may result in overburdening dealers servicing capacity dealers may have trouble funding their daytoday cash flow needs and paying their obligations due to adverse business conditions resulting from negative economic effects or other factors dealers may exit or john deere may seek to terminate relationships with certain dealers if they are unable to meet customer needs the unplanned loss of any john deere dealers could lead to inadequate market coverage negative customer impressions of john deere and may adversely impact john deeres and our ability to collect receivables that are associated with that dealer environmental climate and weather risks unfavorable weather conditions or natural catastrophes that reduce agricultural production and demand for agriculture and turf equipment could directly and indirectly affect john deeres and our business the purchasing decisions of john deeres customers particularly the purchasers of agriculture and turf equipment can be significantly affected by poor or unusual weather conditions such conditions include insufficient levels of rain which prevent farmers from planting new crops and may cause growing crops to die or result in lower yields excessive rain or flooding can prevent planting from occurring at optimal times and may cause crop loss through increased disease or mold growth temperatures outside normal ranges which can cause crop failure or decreased yields and may also affect disease incidence natural disasters such as regional floods hurricanes or other storms droughts diseases wildfires and pests either as a physical effect of climate change or otherwise which have had and could in the future have significant negative effects on agricultural and livestock production adverse weather conditions in a particular geographic region particularly during the important spring selling season and drought conditions can adversely affect sales of certain mowing equipment and can similarly cause lower sales volumes each of these conditions could have a negative impact on farm income which can affect demand for agricultural equipment and the financial condition and credit risk of our customers and john deeres dealers governmental actions designed to address climate change based on the emergence of new technologies and business models in connection with the transition to a lowercarbon economy could adversely affect john deere and its customers there is global scientific consensus that greenhouse gas ghg emissions continue to alter the composition of earths atmosphere in ways that are affecting and are expected to continue to affect the global climate these considerations have led to new international national regional and local legislative and regulatory responses various stakeholders including legislators and regulators shareholders and nongovernmental organizations as well as companies in many business sectors including us and john deere are continuing to look for ways to reduce ghg emissions the regulation of ghg emissions from certain stationary or mobile sources or the imposition of carbon pricing mechanisms could result in additional costs to us and john deere in the form of taxes or emission allowances required facilities improvements and increased energy costs these results would increase john deeres and our operating costs through higher utility transportation and materials cost and could prevent john deere from selling products into certain markets increased input costs such as fuel and fertilizer and compliancerelated costs could also affect customer operations and demand for john deere equipment further we are subject to additional international and national european regulations relating to climate and environmental risk which are continually evolving and could affect the financing operations and climaterisk processes developed by us regulators in europe and the us have also focused efforts on increased disclosure related to climate change and mitigation efforts the eu recently adopted the european sustainability reporting standards esrs and the corporate sustainability reporting directive csrd that will impose disclosure of the risks and opportunities arising from social and environmental issues and on the impact of companies activities on people and the environment the csrd will need to be transposed into member state law before it becomes effective which is expected to occur in similarly the state of california recently passed the climate corporate data accountability act and the climaterelated financial risk act that will impose broad climaterelated disclosure obligations on certain companies doing business in california including us and john deere starting in the securities and exchange commission sec has included in its regulatory agenda potential rulemaking on climate change disclosures that if adopted could significantly increase compliance burdens and associated regulatory costs and complexity financial risks changes in government banking monetary and fiscal policies could have a negative effect on us policies of the us and other governments regarding banking monetary and fiscal policies intended to promote or maintain liquidity stabilize financial markets andor address local deficit or structural economic issues may not be effective and could have a material impact on our customers and markets central bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year most of our retail receivables are fixed rate while wholesale financing receivables are generally variable rate we have both fixed and variable rate borrowings historically rising interest rates impact our borrowings sooner than the benefit is realized from the receivable and lease portfolios our operations and results could also be affected by financial regulatory reform that could among other things have an adverse effect on us and our customers by limiting their ability to enter into hedging transactions or to finance purchases of john deere products government policies on spending can also affect john deere especially the construction and forestry segment due to the impact of government spending on infrastructure development john deere and our operations including those outside of the us may also be affected by nonus regulatory reforms being implemented to further regulate nonus financial institutions and markets changes in tax rates tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could have a negative effect on us and john deere we and john deere are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions john deeres and our domestic and international tax liabilities are dependent upon the location of earnings among these different jurisdictions tax rates in various jurisdictions may be subject to significant change john deeres and our effective tax rates could be affected by changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities or changes in tax laws or their interpretations if john deeres and our effective tax rates were to increase or if the ultimate determination of taxes owed is for an amount more than amounts previously accrued john deeres and our operating results cash flows and financial condition could be adversely affected our consolidated financial results are reported in us dollars while certain assets and other reported items are denominated in foreign currencies creating currency exchange and translation risk we are a global company with transactions denominated in a variety of currencies we are subject to currency exchange risk to the extent that costs are denominated in currencies other than those in which we earn revenues additionally the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements is the us dollar certain of our assets liabilities expenses and revenues are denominated in other countries currencies which are then translated into us dollars at the applicable exchange rates and reported in our consolidated financial statements therefore fluctuations in foreign exchange rates affect the value of those items as reflected in our consolidated financial statements even if their value remains unchanged in their original currencies while the use of currency hedging instruments may provide us with some protection from adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates by utilizing these instruments we potentially forego any benefits that may result from favorable fluctuations in such rates changes in interest rate risks or market liquidity conditions could adversely affect our financials and our earnings andor cash central bank policy interest rates continued to increase in fiscal year rising interest rates could have a dampening effect on overall economic activity andor the financial condition of our customers either or both of which could negatively affect customer demand for john deere equipment and customers ability to repay their obligations to us rising interest rates may cause credit market dislocations that can impact funding costs which can affect our ability to offer customers competitive financing rates while we strive to match the interest rate characteristics of our financial assets and liabilities changing interest rates have had an adverse effect on our financing spreadthe difference between the yield we earn on our assets and the interest rates we pay for fundingwhich has affected our earnings in addition actions by credit rating agencies such as downgrades or negative changes to ratings outlooks can affect the availability and cost of funding for us and can increase our cost of capital and hurt our competitive position because we are a financing company negative economic conditions in the financial industry could materially impact our operations and financial results negative economic conditions could have an adverse effect on the financial industry in which we operate we provide financing for a significant portion of john deeres sales in many of the countries in which we operate we are exposed to the risk that customers and others will default on contractual obligations and may experience credit losses that exceed our expectations and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations our inability to access funds at costeffective rates to support our financing activities could have a material adverse effect on our business our liquidity and ongoing profitability depend largely on timely access to capital to meet future cash flow requirements and to fund operations and costs associated with engaging in diversified funding activities additionally negative market conditions could reduce customer confidence levels resulting in declines in credit applications and increases in delinquencies and default rates which could materially impact our writeoffs and provision for credit losses our results could be adversely affected by a decrease in the value of used equipment or higher than estimated returns of equipment on operating lease we sell repossessed equipment and equipment returned to us at the endoflease terms primarily through the john deere dealer network we estimate the endoflease term residual value at the inception of the operating leases based on a number of factors including lease term expected hours of usage historical wholesale sale prices return experience intended equipment use market dynamics and trends and thirdparty residual guarantees used equipment values may decrease as a result of any one or a combination of factors including market conditions supply of and demand for used equipment and technological advancements in new equipment depressed prices for used equipment may result in or increase a loss upon our disposition of offlease or repossessed equipment and in the case of repossessed equipment we may be unable to collect the resulting deficiency in addition lower residual value estimates could result in increasing operating lease depreciation impairment losses and losses on the sale of matured operating lease inventory which would decrease our earnings we could suffer operational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and manage risk we use models to forecast losses project revenue and expenses assess and control our operations and financial condition perform automated credit decisioning assist in capital planning and forecast and assess capital and liquidity requirements for credit market operational and strategic risks however models are subject to inherent limitations from simplifying assumptions uncertainty regarding economic and financial outcomes and emerging risks our models may not be sufficiently predictive of future results due to limited historical patterns unanticipated market movements customer behavior and liquidity which could limit their effectiveness and require timely recalibration in addition our models may be adversely impacted by human error and may not be effective if we fail to properly oversee and review them at regular intervals and detect their flaws during our review and monitoring processes regardless of the steps we take to help confirm effective controls monitor and test implement new technology and implement new processes we could suffer operational and financial harm if our models fail to properly anticipate and help us manage risks manufacturing and operational risks changes in the availability and price of certain raw materials components and whole goods have resulted and could continue to result in disruptions to the supply chain causing production disruptions increased costs and lower profits on sales of john deere products as our volume of receivables and leases is largely dependent upon the level of retail sales and leases of john deere products supply chain disruptions and impacts of price increases could negatively impact our future volumes john deere requires access to various raw materials components and whole goods at competitive prices to manufacture and distribute our products the price and availability of these materials have varied significantly in the last months while john deere has seen stabilization in the supply chain and some commodity pricing improvements john deere anticipates potential fluctuations due to inflation geopolitical and economic uncertainty and regulatory and policy instability including import tariffs and trade agreements the latter have the potential to significantly increase production and logistics costs and have a material negative effect on the profitability of john deeres business particularly if john deere is unable to recover the increased costs due to market considerations or other factors john deere has experienced changes in the availability and prices of these raw materials components whole goods and freight over the past several years especially in fiscal years and global logistics network challenges resulted in delays shortages of key manufacturing components increased order backlogs increased transportation costs and production inefficiencies from a higher number of partially completed machines in inventory which increased john deeres overall production and overhead costs increases in such costs have had an adverse effect on john deeres business operations john deere relies on its suppliers to acquire the raw materials components and whole goods required to manufacture their products significant disruptions to the supply chain resulting from shortages of raw materials components and whole goods have and could continue to adversely affect john deeres ability to meet commitments to its customers in addition certain materials and components used in john deere products are acquired from a single supplier or are proprietary in nature and cannot be alternatively sourced expeditiously furthermore if john deeres customers are unwilling to accept price increases for its products or if john deere is unable to offset the increases in costs raw material costs or shortages could have a material adverse effect on john deeres operational or financial results which could negatively impact us resources risks our ability to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees could affect our ability to execute our strategy our continued success depends in part on our ability to identify and attract qualified candidates with the requisite education background and experience as well as our ability to develop engage and retain qualified employees failure to attract develop engage and retain qualified employees whether as a result of an insufficient number of qualified applicants difficulty in recruiting new employees or inadequate resources to train integrate and retain qualified employees could impair our ability to execute our business strategy and could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition while we strive to reduce the impact of the departure of employees our operations or ability to execute our business strategy and meet our business objectives may be affected by the loss of employees particularly when departures involve larger numbers of employees such as those we could experience if a surge occurs in the number of employees voluntarily leaving their jobs higher rates of employee separations may adversely affect us through decreased employee morale the loss of knowledge of departing employees and the devotion of resources to recruiting and onboarding new employees security breaches and other disruptions to our information technology infrastructure could interfere with our operations and could compromise the information of us as well as our customers andor john deere dealers exposing us to liability that could cause our business and reputation to suffer in the ordinary course of business we rely upon information technology networks and systems some of which are managed by third parties to process transmit and store electronic information and to manage or support a variety of business processes and activities including credit application and collection of payments from dealers and other purchasers of john deere equipment we use information technology systems to record process and summarize financial information and results of operations for internal reporting purposes and to comply with regulatory financial reporting legal and tax requirements additionally we collect and store sensitive data including intellectual property proprietary business information and the proprietary business information of our customers and john deere dealers as well as personally identifiable information of our customers and employees in data centers which are often owned by third parties and on information technology networks the secure operation of these information technology networks and the processing and maintenance of this information is critical to our business operations and strategy despite security measures including a vulnerability disclosure program and business continuity plans our information technology networks and infrastructure have been and may be vulnerable to intrusion damage disruptions or shutdowns due to attacks by cyber criminals employees suppliers or dealers errors or malfeasance supply chain compromises disruptions during the process of upgrading or replacing computer software or hardware power outages computer viruses ransomware or other malware telecommunication or utility failures terrorist acts natural disasters or other events although we have not suffered any significant cyber incidents that resulted in a material business impact we have from time to time been the target of malicious cyber threat actors the occurrence of any significant event could compromise our networks and the information stored there could be accessed obtained publicly disclosed lost altered misused or stolen any such access disclosure alteration misuse or other loss of information could result in legal claims or proceedings government investigations liability or regulatory penalties disruption or shut down of our operations and damage to our reputation which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition furthermore as security threats continue to evolve and increase in frequency and sophistication we may need to invest additional resources to protect information security our operations are affected by risks associated with our use of vendors and other thirdparty service providers we rely on vendor and thirdparty service providers for a variety of products and services to run our core credit operations such as customer invoicing collections and software solutions this reliance exposes us to risks of those third parties failing to perform financially or contractually to our expectations these risks could include material adverse impacts on our business such as disruption or interruption of business activities cyberattacks and information security breaches poor performance of services affecting our customer relationships and possibilities that we could be responsible to our customers for legal and regulatory violations committed by those third parties while conducting services on our behalf while we have implemented ongoing monitoring to address this risk there can be no assurance that our vendor and thirdparty relationships will not have a material adverse impact on our business legal and compliance risks our global operations are subject to complex and changing laws and regulations the violation of which could expose us to potential liabilities increased costs and other adverse effects our global operations are subject to numerous international federal state and local laws and regulations many of which are complex frequently changing and subject to varying interpretations these laws and regulations cover a broad spectrum of subject areas including advertising antimoney laundering antitrust consumer finance environmental climaterelated health and safety foreign exchange controls and cash repatriation restrictions foreign ownership and investment human rights labor and employment and data privacy these laws may vary substantially within the different countries in which we operate compliance with these laws and regulations is costly and may further increase the cost of conducting our global operations in addition we must comply with the us foreign corrupt practices act and all applicable foreign anticorruption laws including the uk bribery act which generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments or providing anything of value to improperly influence government officials or private individuals for the purpose of obtaining or retaining a business advantage regardless of whether those practices are culturally expected in a particular jurisdiction although we have a compliance program in place designed to reduce the likelihood of potential violations of such laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate such laws and regulations or our policies and procedures violations of these laws and regulations could result in criminal or civil sanctions and have a material adverse effect on our reputation business results of operations and financial condition changes to existing laws and regulations or changes to how they are interpreted or the implementation of new more stringent laws or regulations could adversely affect our business by increasing compliance costs limiting our ability to offer a product or service requiring changes to our business practices or otherwise making our products and services less attractive to customers legislative and regulatory changes and other actions that could potentially affect our business may be announced with little or no advance notice and we may not be able to effectively mitigate all adverse effects from such measures we are subject to governmental laws regulations and other legal obligations related to privacy and data protection any inability or perceived inability of addressing these requirements could adversely affect our business the legislative and regulatory framework for privacy and data protection issues worldwide is rapidly evolving and is likely to remain uncertain for the foreseeable future we collect personal information and other data as integral parts of our business processes and activities this data is subject to a variety of us and foreign laws and regulations including oversight by various regulatory and other governmental bodies many foreign countries and governmental bodies including the european union eu and other relevant jurisdictions where we conduct business have laws and regulations concerning the collection and use of personal information and other data obtained from their residents or by businesses operating within their jurisdictions the eu general data protection regulation and the california consumer privacy act among others impose stringent data protection requirements and provide significant penalties for noncompliance new privacy laws will continue to come into effect around the world in the future any inability or perceived inability to adequately address privacy and data protection concerns even if unfounded or comply with applicable laws regulations policies industry standards contractual obligations or other legal obligations could result in additional cost and liability to us damage our reputation inhibit revenue and otherwise adversely affect our business legal proceedings and disputes in which we are and may in the future be involved could harm our business financial condition reputation and brand we are subject to a variety of legal proceedings and legal compliance risks around the world we face risks of exposure to various types of claims lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations in the ordinary course of business the most prevalent of which relate to retail credit matters the uncertainty associated with substantial unresolved claims and lawsuits may harm our business financial condition reputation and brand the defense of lawsuits and government inquiries or investigations has resulted and may result in the expenditures of significant financial resources and the diversion of managements time and attention away from business operations such legal proceedings may also affect our assessment and estimates of loss contingencies recorded as a reserve and require us to make payments exceeding our reserves general risks john deeres and our reputation and brand could be damaged by negative publicity john deeres brand has worldwide recognition and significantly contributes to the success of both our businesses john deeres reputation is critical to growing the customer base john deeres brand depends on the ability to maintain a positive customer perception of the business including the core values of integrity quality innovation and commitment negative claims or publicity involving john deere its products or services its culture and values its stance on environmental social and governance topics customer data or any of its key employees or suppliers could damage john deeres reputation and brand image regardless of whether such claims are accurate damage to john deeres reputation could adversely impact its and our ability to attract new and maintain existing customer employee dealer and business relationships additionally negative or inaccurate postings articles or comments on social media and the internet about john deere could generate negative publicity that could damage the reputation of john deere us or the john deere brand further adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against john deere or us or legal action initiated by john deere or us could also damage john deeres and our reputation and brand image undermine customer confidence and reduce longterm demand for john deere equipment even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to john deeres or our operations if the reputation culture or image of john deeres brands are damaged or john deere or we receive negative publicity then our revenue financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected unexpected events have and may in the future increase our cost of doing business or disrupt our operations the occurrence of one or more unexpected events including war acts of terrorism epidemics and pandemics such as the covid19 pandemic civil unrest fires tornadoes tsunamis hurricanes earthquakes floods and other forms of severe weather in the us or in other countries in which we operate or in which john deere suppliers are located have and could in the future adversely affect our operations and financial performance such events have and could cause complete or partial closure of one or more of john deeres manufacturing facilities or distribution centers temporary or longterm disruption in the supply of component products from some local and international suppliers and disruption and delay in the transport of john deere products to dealers endusers and distribution centers existing insurance coverage may not provide protection from all the costs that may arise from such events the potential physical impacts of climate change on john deeres facilities suppliers and customers and therefore on john deeres operations are highly uncertain and will be particular to the circumstances developing in various geographic regions these potential physical effects may adversely affect the demand for john deeres products and the financial performance of john deeres and our operations
