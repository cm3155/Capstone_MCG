management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases third quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of

barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you very much good morning everyone as always the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of the only significant item this quarter was discretionary net investment securities losses in corporate of million as a result of repositioning the portfolio by selling us treasuries and mortgages our strong results this quarter reflect the resilience of the franchise in a dynamic environment touching on a few highlights we had record third quarter revenue in markets of billion we ranked number in retail deposit share based on fdic data and credit is still healthy with net chargeoffs remaining low on page we have more detail revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear excluding the net investment securities losses it was up nii ex markets was up billion or driven by higher rates nir ex markets was down billion or largely driven by lower ib fees and the securities losses and markets revenue was up million or yearonyear expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear driven by higher structural costs and investments and credit costs of billion included net chargeoffs of million the net reserve build of million included a million build in wholesale reflecting loan growth and updates to the firms macroeconomic scenarios partially offset by million release in home lending on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up basis points versus the prior quarter which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions partially offset by the impact of aoci rwa was down approximately billion quarteronquarter with growth in lending more than offset by continued active balance sheet management and lower market risk rwa given our results this quarter we are well positioned to meet our cet1 targets of in the fourth quarter and in the first quarter of these current targets include a basis point buffer over the growing regulatory requirements which provides flexibility over the coming quarters jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 to conclude on capital with the future increases in our riskbased requirements slr will no longer be our binding capital constraint so we announced the call of billion in prefs this quarter and issued billion in sub debt to rebalance our capital stack now lets go to our businesses starting on page before i review ccbs performance let me provide you with an update on the health of us consumers and small businesses based on our data nominal spend is still strong across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories with combined debit and credit spend up year onyear cash buffers remain elevated across all income segments however with spending growing faster than income we are seeing a continued decrease in median deposits yearonyear particularly in the lower income segments and not surprisingly small business owners are increasingly focused on the risks in the economic outlook now moving to financial results this quarter ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear in consumer business banking revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates deposits were up yearonyear and down quarteronquarter we ranked number in retail deposit share based on fdic data up sic basis points yearonyear making us the fastestgrowing among the top banks and we are now number in la in addition to new york and chicago making us topranked in the three largest markets client investment assets were down year onyear driven by market performance partially offset by flows home lending revenue was down yearon year on lower production margins and volume moving to card auto revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher card nii partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up and while revolving balances were up driven by strong net new account originations and growth in revolving balances per account they still remain slightly below pre pandemic levels and in auto originations were billion down due to lack of vehicle supply and rising rates expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by the investments were making in technology travel marketing and branches in terms of actual credit performance this quarter credit costs were million reflecting net chargeoffs of million which were up million yearonyear largely driven by loan growth in card as well as a reserve release of million in home lending card delinquencies remain well below pre pandemic levels though we continue to see gradual normalization next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was down yearonyear ib fees were down versus a strong third quarter last year we maintained our number rank with a yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were down reflecting lower announced activity this year underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market volatility resulting in fees down for debt and down for equity in terms of the fourth quarter outlook we expect to be down versus a very strong prior year and while our existing pipeline is healthy conversion will of course depend on market conditions lending revenue of million was up versus the prior year driven by higher nii on loan growth moving to markets revenue was billion up yearonyear fixed income was up as elevated volatility drove strong client activity in the macro franchise partially offset by a less favorable environment in jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 securitized products equity markets were down against a record third quarter last year this quarter saw relative strength in derivatives lower balances in prime and lower cash revenues on lower block activity payments revenue was billion up yearonyear excluding the net impact of equity investments it was up and the yearonyear growth was driven by higher rates and growth in fees securities services revenue of billion was relatively flat yearonyear expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by compensation credit costs were million driven by a net reserve build of million moving to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of million record revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins partially offset by lower investment banking revenue gross investment banking revenue of million was down yearonyear driven by reduced capital markets activity expenses of billion were up yearonyear deposits were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter primarily driven by attrition of nonoperating balances while our core operating balances have shown stability as payment volumes continue to be robust loans were up yearonyear and sequentially ci loans were up sequentially reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization cre loans were up sequentially driven by lower prepayment activity in commercial term lending and real estate banking finally credit costs were million predominantly driven by a net reserve build of million while net chargeoffs remained low and then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of for the quarter revenue of billion was up yearonyear predominantly driven by deposits and loans on higher margins and balances largely offset by reductions in management fees linked to this years market declines expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by compensation including investments in our private banking advisor teams technology and asset management initiatives for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion across fixed income equities and alternatives aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion were down and yearonyear respectively driven by lower market levels partially offset by continued net inflows and finally loans were flat quarteronquarter while deposits were down sequentially driven by migration to investments partially offset by client flows turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was a net loss of million compared to a net loss of billion last year nii was million up billion yearonyear driven by the impact of higher rates nir was a loss of billion down million primarily due to the securities losses i mentioned upfront and expenses of million were higher by million yearonyear next the outlook on page going forward we will also provide guidance for total firmwide nii for the fourth quarter we expect it to be approximately billion implying full year nii of approximately billion and we expect nii ex markets for the fourth quarter to also be about billion implying that we expect markets nii to be around zero which brings the full year to about billion while were not giving nii guidance today you will recall that at investor day we talked about a fourth quarter nii ex markets run rate of billion with potential upside for the full year todays guidance for the fourth quarter of this year implies an approximate run rate of billion and from this much higher level we would now expect some modest decline for the full year jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 in addition theres quite a bit of uncertainty surrounding the trajectory of key drivers including rates deposit reprice and loan growth so keep both of those things in mind as you update the estimates in your models moving to expenses our outlook remains unchanged and as it relates to the card net chargeoff rate we now expect the fullyear rate to be approximately below our previous expectations so to wrap up we are happy with the strong diversified performance of the quarter as we continue to navigate an environment of elevated uncertainty with that i will turn it over to jamie for some additional remarks jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jeremy thank you very much hello everybody yeah i just want to give you a little more insight into how were looking at capital interest rates a little bit so capital planning were very comfortable with the earnings power of this company which you could see is enormous and the margins and the returns and more importantly than that is that were growing franchise value i think all around the firm and in most areas were up in market share in a few areas were not and of course that disappoints us but the earnings power gives us lot of confidence that well get over that in the first quarter but we always have to keep in mind the volatility and a bunch of other things so we know we have to deal with basel iv we dont know when and how this is going to be and any change in gsib such as an uncertainty in the back of our mind aoci aoci was traditionally countercyclical but in this kind of environment is more procyclical so think of if rates go up another basis points thats billion easily can handle it just in the back of our mind cecl cecl already incorporates a percent of what we think the adverse consequences might be but obviously if the environment gets worse well have to add to reserves andor if we change our outlook meaning that we think the chance of adverse events are higher well change our reserves put in the back of your mind that if unemployment goes to or youre probably talking about billion or billion over the course of a couple of quarters again easy to handle not a big deal it just does affect capital a little bit and then rwa management i mean i think were showing that we can easily manage rwa and drive it down in some areas and up in other areas and stuff like that with what i would say a very limited financial effect and the way you should look at this is we dont tell commercial bank or investment bank dont get new business dont serve your clients so were serving clients the way we always do and you see the loan book growing in a lot of areas but there are some discretionary things which barely affect us so were not putting conforming mortgage on the balance sheet whether we originate them or whether correspondents originate them for the most part because it makes very low sense to do that on the balance sheet and we make other choices and so there are a lot of tools to manage it obviously with the capital requirements going up were going to find ways to reduce rwa and im talking about over years strategically i think without affecting our basic franchises interest rates i think the way to look at it is were fairly neutral at this point to interest rates going up or down jeremy said the billion please do not annualize that there are a lot of uncertainties today and im just going to mention a few were not worried about them its not going to change things dramatically but it does change things whats going to be qts effect on deposits how much deposit migration youre going to have in this new jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 technological environment and there are pluses and minuses in that and of course there are lags there are lags in consumer theres going to be some lags in treasury services theres going to be some lags in commercial banking so its just on the back of our mind were going to kind of actively manage that and the other thing i want to point out is that taking investment securities losses for the most part is going to be sic because we want to sell rich securities and replace them with cheap securities we dont want to be locked into something we think will get worse and not take a chance to buy something that we think will get better so you might expect to see that taking place now than sic that maybe some securities loss sic losses in the future we can do that were not doing we can do this to manage interest rate exposure but for the most part we can do that with swaps too or other things we just do it the most efficient and effective way and i want the people managing these portfolios to know that we can sell things we dont want to own and buy things that we do want to own and other than that we think it was a very good strong quarter across the board and i guess well open for questions now jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks jamie lets go ahead and open up for questions question and answer section operator please stand by and the first question is coming from the line of ken usdin from jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks a lot good morning i just wanted to follow up on the nii and the deposit side to jamies comments there obviously one of the toughest uncertainties is to understand how we think about flows and mix and beta so just starting to see it it looks like in terms of deposit costs starting to increase so how do you think about it now in this new environment where we might go to maybe higher in terms of how betas might act over the course of this cycle as compared to any prior cycles and previous thoughts thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks ken good morning okay so at investor day youll recall that jenn said that we expected betas to be low this cycle as they were in the prior cycle which was a low beta cycle by historical standards and what were now seeing as we see the rate hikes come through and we see the deposit rate paid develop is that were seeing realized betas being even lower than the prior cycle just through the actuals and the question indiscernible is why is that and its of course we dont really know but plausible theories include the speed of the hikes which probably means that some of this is lag but also the fact that the system is more better positioned from a liquidity perspective than in prior cycles so as we look forward we know that lags are significant right now we know that at some point that will start to come out obviously in wholesale they come out much faster thats probably starting to happen now but the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 exact timing of how that develops is going to be very much a function of the competitive environment in the marketplace for deposits and well see how that plays out ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and then just the second followup on jamies points about like okay if things do look worse ahead looking ahead you might have to build a little bit more understandable over the next couple of years can you just help us understand just where you are in your scenario now as scenarios build and just today still looks great tomorrow theres some more uncertainty so how do we just get to start to understand how quickly and how you get your handle on that magnitude of acl delta and how do you think about it versus either i dont know pandemic peak or day one cecl its very hard for all of us to see this of course jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah as you know i think cecl is an enormously bad accounting policy honestly i wouldnt spend too much time on it because its not a real number its a hypothetical probabilitybased number im trying to make it very simple for you so if you look at the pandemic we put up billion over two quarters and then we took it down over three or four after that and all it did was swing all these numbers and it didnt change that much yeah im trying to give you a number but obviously this number would be plus or minus several billion but if unemployment goes to and that becomes the central kind of case and then you have possibility it gets better and possibility it gets worse we would probably have to add something like billion or billion that probably would happen over two or three quarters ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i mean thats as simple as i can make it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co right now what we have right we already have a percent in these adverse and severe adverse case if we change that next quarter that will be part of that billion im talking about ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes okay understood thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 operator the next question is coming from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i guess just following up jamie so appreciate cecl and the modelbased approach i think you were quoted in the press talking about the potential for a recession in the next six to nine months would appreciate any perspective in terms of are you beginning to see cracks either in commercial real estate consumer where it feels like the economic pain from inflation higher rates is beginning to filter through to your clients would appreciate any insights there jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ill take that ebrahim thanks the short answer to that question is just no we just dont see anything that you could realistically describe as a crack in any of our actual credit performance i made some comments about this in the prepared remarks on the consumer side but weve done some fairly detailed analysis about different cohorts and early delinquency bucket entry rates and stuff like that and we do see in some cases some tiny increases but generally in almost all cases we think thats normalization and its even slower than we expect jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think id say were in an environment where its kind of odd which is very strong consumer spend you see it in our numbers you see it in other peoples numbers up prior to last year up precovid balance sheets are very good for consumers credit card borrowing is normalizing not getting worse you might see and thats really good so you can go into a recession youve got a very strong consumer however its rather predictable if you look at how theyre spending and inflation so inflation if its reduces that by and that extra cap money they have in their checking accounts will deplete probably by sometime midyear next year and then of course you have inflation higher rates higher mortgage rates oil volatility war so those things are out there and that its not a crack in current numbers its quite predictable it will strain future numbers ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and just tied to that i think the other thing that investors from the outside worry about is interconnectedness of the system be it the uk gilts market lbos how much are you worried about that part of the business in terms of having a meaningful impact in terms of a capital shock at some point over the next year just given all the qt happening around the world jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well i mentioned qt as being one of the uncertainties because its a very large change in the flow of funds around the world who are the buyers and sellers of sovereign debt theres a lot of sovereign debt but i think if you look at the gilt thing alone its a bump its not going to change what we do or how we do it and youre going to see bumps like that because of all the things i have already mentioned its inevitable that youre going to see them whether they create systemic risk i dont know jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 i have pointed out its harder for banks to intermediate in that and that creates a little bit more fragility in the system that does not mean that youre going to see a crack of some sort but again its almost impossible not to have real volatility based on the facts we already told you those are large uncertainties that we know about today and in the future ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and great messaging on the call today thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning hey jeremy at the investor day you noted that expense growth in would slow from this years level and might be slightly higher than consensus expectations at the time so is that now that you get closer to next year does that still hold and if the economy does get worse than expected is there some levers to pull or is it just still investing heavily regardless jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks jim so broadly yes it still holds no real change on the outlook just to remind everyone at investor day i think the consensus was billion for we said you were a little low i think it got revised up to sort of the billion or something like that and thats now still roughly in the right ballpark obviously were going through our budget cycle were looking at the opportunity set and the environment set for next year so its not set in stone but broadly on the question of investment and im sure jamie will agree here that our investment decisions are very much throughthecycle decisions and so were not going to tend to change those just because of a sort of difference in the shortterm economic environment of course the volume and revenuerelated expense can fluctuate as a function of the environment as you would expect jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co now i would just like to add so obviously id just like to add obviously compensation go up or down dramatically so youll have different estimates about investment banking revenues and markets revenues and we cant really adjust for your numbers for that but i just want to point out the other side of this were making heavy investments and we have among the best margins in the business i think thats a very good thing jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 right and maybe on that front leveraged loan write were there any leveraged loan writedowns this quarter and is that and how do you is that market beginning to clear or are there still overhangs jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co there were no real leveraged loan writedowns this quarter and that market isnt yet to clear we own our share of it is very small so were very comfortable jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay thanks operator the next question is coming from the line of john mcdonalds sic john mcdonald from autonomous you may proceed john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning jeremy wanted to ask about your ear disclosures what we call your rate sensitivity disclosures they look a little different than peers and when we look at the sensitivity to basis points of higher rates beyond the forward curve it looks like youre liability sensitive can you give us some context of maybe the limitations of that disclosure and how we should put that in context of the assumptions behind it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks john and id love to have a very long conversation with you about this but im going to keep it short here its really all about lags so as our disclosure says we do not include the impact of reprice lags in our ear calculation so as a result of that the entire calculation is based on modeled rates paid in the terminal state as you well know right now were in the middle of some very significant lags which are affecting the numbers quite a bit and which we expect to persist for some time so as a result of that what i would expect in the near term is something quite similar to what weve experienced this year as you know this year as rates have gone up weve revised our nii outlook from billion at the beginning of the year to now billion so as we look forward in the near term from here i would expect similar type sensitivities to rate fluctuations given the lag environment that were in john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and just to follow up on jamies comments about not annualizing the fourth quarter is that where the risks lie to annualizing the fourth quarter what are some of the puts and takes you said it might be down a little bit from that fourth quarter annualized jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah look ive already mentioned you have a rapidly changing yield curve deposit migration everyone does ear differently so one is lag one is we assume deposit migration some people dont our ecr is included in there some people dont and all of that i just think for your models because of all that kind of stuff just use a jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 number less than annualized in the billion so instead of billion use a number like billion and i just keep it as simple as possible and we dont know we hope to beat that but with all the stuff going on you just got to be a little cautious and conservative john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks operator the next question is coming from the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc well good morning i agree with ebrahim that your presentation this morning was quite crisp and impactful so im going to ask the question that i think has been sort of the key debate to the stock all year so at investor day in may you mentioned a rotce target of and that was before we found out that the scb would be higher in june as we think about your capital build is going faster than expected and you think about the revenue power that shows through in this firm plus or minus what may happen with cecl do you think you can achieve rotce next year jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah this is obviously a good question the answer is yes and one of the things we always look at is normalized rotce so were very honest were not overearning on nii maybe a little bit because of lags and stuff like that but not a lot but we are overearning on credit think of credit card the weve never seen a number that low were quite conscious of that so we dont brag about the this quarter thinking thats going to continue forever its not and obviously we may adjust that a little bit but its not a material adjustment were going to find weve got a lot of great bright people and were going to find a lot of ways to squeeze some of these things down including like ccar and scb and liquidate some assets and change business models just a little bit if you look at our acquisitions for example they were nongsifi acquisitions noncapital nongsifi all services and service related so thats what were going to do over time and were pretty comfortable that well get very good returns so yeah were quite and next year is totally dependent on what happens in the environment but the other thing i would look at maybe well give you this number another time is what would we earn in a recession we would have pretty damn good returns in a recession i mean so i feel very good about that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you for that jamie and this is a supermicro question as a followup for jeremy why would markets nii be zero next quarter and should we expect that to be zero next year jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks erika jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its terrifically simple were financing the markets businesses at the yield curve so youre earning the same thing youre paying to finance the trading book jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah erika i mean basically as rates go up the funding cost goes up and the offsets on the other side in many cases were through derivatives or derivativelike instruments so it goes through nir fundamentally we believe the markets business revenue is rate insensitive you can see that history through our disclosures this year so as you look out to next year with the forward curve implying a much less biased evolution of fed funds you shouldnt expect to see as many changes at least from rates of course we can sometimes see somewhat more unpredictable changes from balances but that should be unbiased one way or the other erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thanks operator the next question is coming from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jamie once again im trying to reconcile your actions with your words youve said publicly you mentioned the hurricane you mentioned a recession you mentioned look out and there are all sorts of risks i dont think anyone disagrees with that on the other hand your reservestoloans are still well below cecl day one so your actions with the reserving dont seem to reflect your more pessimistic comments about the economy so how do i reconcile the two jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so the way to do that is in our reserves today there is a significant percentage probability that we put on adverse and severe adverse already so its in there already a lot of people work in these cecl reserves our economists jeremy a lot of other folks so its not set by me because i happen to think that the odds might be different than other people but i completely understand what youre saying but the numbers are very good we have some of that im trying to be very honest about if things get worse here is what it might mean for reserves that may be different because of course these calculations change all the time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 the other thing michael which is another thing which in cecl the timing of when something happens is very important so if it happens if you said a recession is going to happen in the fourth quarter of next year that would be very different to you say its to going to happen in the first quarter of next year mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah i just understood it as the lifetime losses on the loans as opposed to that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co it is but some loans yes but some loans have a short life and some loans have a long life mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so lets just cut to the chase where are you versus three months ago i mean is it you certainly got headlines with the hurricane comment and all that and its look like as you said you have debt tightening qt tighter capital rules for banks you have like the trifecta of tightening by the fed and then you have wars and everything else so i dont think anyone and the stock market supports your view about all the risks out there but are things better worse or the same as they were three months ago jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co theyre roughly the same were just getting closer to what you and i might consider bad events and my hurricane ive been very consistent but looking at probabilities and possibilities there is still for example a possibility of a soft landing we can debate what we think that percentage is yours might be different than mine but theres a possibility of a mild recession consumers are in very good shape companies are in very good shape and theres a possibly of something worse mostly because of the war in ukraine and oil price and all the things like that i would not change my possibilities and probabilities this quarter versus last quarter for me mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co on a different point yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah last followup i know you invest through cycles youve always done that youre consistent but i mean your head count increase is probably going to be the highest in the industry i mean head count from to your cib youre adding head count and if you did expect weakness in nine months from now wouldnt you wait to hire people maybe get them a little cheaper jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 no mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thanks a lot operator thank you the next question is coming from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi a couple of questions one just on the investment spend could you give us a sense as to the areas that youre leaning in the most as we should be thinking about into next year because youve obviously done a lot this year with regard to technology advancement companies that youre buying to enhance your digital capabilities and international expansion in particular on the consumer side so just thinking through is this continuation on those themes or is there something else we should be looking for jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co betsy its exactly what we showed you at investor day almost no change so take out that deck we broke out by business kind of investment investment spend tech spend its pretty much on track for that betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and the inflation that drives some of that cost structure you can deal with through just efficiencies elsewhere is that fair jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co believe it or not that was in the numbers we gave you in may betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then separately on the bond restructuring that you did this quarter and the comments around look we dont need to hold stuff we dont need to hold we dont want to hold would that that kind of suggests to me that therell be more bond restructuring as we go through the next quarter is there any reason why you didnt clean the whole thing up this quarter jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no i think i said we sell rich securities and buy cheap so you look at if you look what happened to mortgage spreads they gapped out they gapped in we bought they gapped out we sold and that kind of stuff getting getting you could have different point of views but and i do expect future bond losses going forward i just dont think thats real earnings so i think but i want our people our experts in the investment area to know if they really want to sell something were going to sell it were not going to sit here and lock ourselves into something thats gotten very very rich because we feel like we cant take a bond loss and remember it doesnt affect capital and in fact when you reinvest it which we tend to do we actually have higher earnings going forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks operator the next question is coming from the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and let me just add too like you saw the clos gapped out in europe i want our people when they gap out like or basis points i want them to be willing to buy they might sell something to do that but that is a very smart thing to do glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thank you this is glenn so look from time to time weird things happen in the market we get these losses like archegos and now this uk pension ldi issue so my question for you is besides that do you have risk in the derivatives book and is this situation done its more of when you meet with risk committee are there pockets of leverage that youre considering on these big market moves whether it be the dollar or rates where we are not thinking of like a or do you view the ldi issue as an isolated event jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey yeah hi ill mention and jeremy you might have something to add so the ldi thing is a bump in the road and i think the bank of england is also trying to get through this thing without changing all the policy about monetary policy and qt and i was surprised to see how much leverage there was in some of those pension plans and my experience in life has been when you have things like what were going through today there are going to be other surprises someone is going to be offsides we dont see anything that looks systemic but there is leverage in certain credit portfolios theres leverage in certain companies theres leverage so youre probably going to see some of that i do think youre going to see volatile markets you already see very low liquidity so something like the ldi thing could cause more issues down the road if it happens constantly and stuff like that but so far its a bump in the road the banking system itself is extraordinarily strong jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi would the dollar qualify as one of those superstrong moves that could put people offsides and if so how do you make sure you protect jpmorgan against that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well were not taking them we generally hedge when it comes to big currencies and stuff like that but yes dollar flows qt emerging markets hedge funds yes that would be a category that might something might happen there it wouldnt be it shouldnt be something thats going to affect jpmorgan that much in fact it usually creates an opportunity for jpmorgan glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah on that point glenn i was going to say the same thing what was traditionally the case that emerging markets struggle sovereigns struggle with the kind of dollar strength that were experiencing right now but our emerging markets franchise folks have been through these cycles before so we manage through it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you both appreciate it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i mean just to add to the strength of the franchise i remember looking back at our emerging markets results by quarter over a decade it was shocking to me how few quarters and how few countries we ever lost money we may have had low returns in some quarters but it was shocking we made money in argentina almost every year for the last years and i think there was one quarter we put up reserves for one of the oil companies and took them down but its kind of very the stability is striking operator the next question is coming from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jeremy and good morning jamie you guys have been talking about the system the liquidity with jamie you referenced qt also the fragility of the system can you share with us what are the metrics you guys are looking at to see if the system does have a problem on liquidity just this week you probably saw that the swiss national bank upped its reserve currency swap lines to billion so what are some of the things you guys focus in on to see if theres going to be maybe more some liquidity issues that could lead to greater problems jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean gerard broadly if you just look at standard regulatory reporting of lcr ratios in the us banking system everyone just has very significant surpluses and of course we can go into the question of as qt plays through and how that interacts with rrp and loan growth whether that puts some pressure on banking system deposits but thats starting from a very very strong position so theres a lot of cushion there for that to come down before you start to have a real challenge from a liquidity perspective jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and we look at everything from the fed repo to quantitative tightening to net issuance of treasuries net issuance of mortgages and treasury volatility and treasury bidask spreads and treasury markets and all that were looking at all of that the banking system itself is extremely strong extremely strong it is not what youre going to see will not be in the banking and there may be a bankers offsides somewhere but itll be somewhere else itll be somewhere else it might be in credit it might be in emerging markets it might be in fx but youre likely to have something like that when you have events like the ones were talking about gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then in terms of the investment banking and capital markets businesses can you guys give us any color into pipelines how they stood at the end of the third quarter and as youre going into the fourth quarter what youre seeing in terms of those business lines jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and ive always pointed out to you all the pipelines come and go okay youve seen that the size weve never had before so pipeline is not necessary to see i would put in your model lower ib revenues next quarter than this quarter based on what we see today markets we have no idea seasonally its generally a low quarter in the fourth quarter but we dont know this quarter because theres so much activity taking place and your guess is as good as ours gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very fair thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank you may proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc can you guys talk about the outlook for loan growth the next few quarters and besides some of the obvious areas like leveraged lending and correspondent mortgage you already talked about any areas that youre tightening around the edges jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 yeah matt let me take your last question first so in general no we underwrite through the cycle we havent we didnt really loosen our underwriting standards in the moment where everything looked great and so we dont see any need to tighten now really a lot of consistency there in terms of the actual loan growth outlook we had said for this year obviously only one quarter left that wed have highsingle digits no meaningful change to that outlook there probably a little bit of a headwind as a function of rates as you mentioned and some of the rwa optimization in mortgages as we go into next year we remain very positive and optimistic about the card story across a range of dimensions in terms of both outstandings and revolver normalization but for the rest of the loan growth environment its going to be i think very dependent especially in wholesale on the macro situation we know that in recessionary environments we tend to see lower loan demand at the same time weve got a lot of great initiatives going and client engagement and new clients so well just have to see how that plays out next year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and i guess when we read the headlines about home prices going down in some markets and car prices starting to roll i mean why doesnt that drive some tightening in those businesses jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well it has i mean look at the volumes in mortgage have dropped and cars quota have dropped and stuff like that and thats already in our numbers and we would expect that to continue that way matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator the last question is coming from the line of charles peabody from portales partners you may proceed charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc yeah im just curious in your guidance on nii where you kind of implied fourth quarter would be peak run rate next year do you factor in any impact from a possible treasury buyback program which could redirect liquidity out of the money market system into the banking system and therefore keep your deposit betas lower do you think about that at all as a possibility jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes i think i i dont know if you were listening when i said it before qt net issuance of mortgages net issuance of treasuries globally is going to reduce deposits and create certain forms of volatility and absolutely we incorporate that on our thinking including lags the change in the yield curve change in spreads and all those things in the numbers we gave you and thats why were trying to be conservative with nii that while you can annualize the billion to billion if you have a model put in billion and it incorporates all of that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14oct2022 charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co youre welcome operator at the moment there are no further questions on the line jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase
