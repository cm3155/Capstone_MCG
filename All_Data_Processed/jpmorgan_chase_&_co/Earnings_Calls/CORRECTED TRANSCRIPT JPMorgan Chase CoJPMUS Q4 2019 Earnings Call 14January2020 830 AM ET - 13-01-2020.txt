management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases fourth quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jennifer piepszak ms piepszak please go ahead jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone ill take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and revenue of billion with a return on tangible common equity of underlying performance continues to be strong deposit growth accelerated in the fourth quarter across consumer and wholesale with average balances up yearonyear we saw solid loan growth with card and awm being the bright spots as average loans across the company were up yearonyear excluding the impact of home lending loan sales in prior quarters client investment assets in consumer business banking were up and asset wealth management aum was up reflecting stronger market performance versus the prior year as well as organic growth we ranked number for the full year in global ib fees with wallet share and gross ib revenue in the commercial bank was a record billion in cib markets we were up yearonyear compared to a weak fourth quarter last year however its important to note the quarter was very strong in absolute terms in fact a record fourth quarter and credit performance continues to be strong across the company onto page and some more detail about our fourth quarter results revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear with net interest income down million or on lower rates largely offset by balance sheet growth and mix and higher cib markets nii noninterest revenue was up billion or on higher revenue in cib markets and awm and continued strong performance in home lending and auto expenses of billion were up on volume and revenuerelated costs credit remains favorable with credit costs of billion down million or yearonyear reflecting modest net reserve releases and net chargeoffs in line with expectations turning to the full year results on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of sic and revenue of billion all records and delivered a return on tangible common equity of revenue was up billion or yearonyear with net interest income up billion or on balance sheet growth and mix as well as higher average shortterm rates partially offset by higher deposit pay rates noninterest revenue was up billion or driven by growth across consumer and higher cib markets revenue and expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by continued investments as well as volume and revenuerelated costs partially offset by lower fdic charges jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 revenue growth and our continued expense discipline generated positive operating leverage for the full year and on credit performance remained strong throughout credit costs were billion in consumer credit costs were up million reflecting an increase in card due to balance growth largely offset by lower credit costs in home lending and in wholesale we were up million largely due to reserve releases and higher recoveries both in moving to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the fourth quarter with a cet1 ratio of up slightly versus last quarter the firm distributed billion of capital to shareholders in the quarter including billion of net repurchases and a common dividend of per share and while on the topic of capital its worth noting given the actions we have taken we fully expect that we will remain in the gsib bucket before we move into the business results ill spend a moment talking about cecl on page as you know the transition to cecl was effective on january and therefore there is no impact to our financials on the page is the cecl adoption impact an overall net increase to the allowance for credit losses of billion which is at the lower end of the range we provided this was driven by an increase in consumer of billion mostly coming from card partially offset by a decrease in wholesale of billion in card the increase is a result of moving to lifetime loss coverage versus a shorter loss emergence period under the incurred model whereas in wholesale modeling changes like using specific macroeconomic forecasts versus throughthecycle loss rates under incurred result in a decrease especially given the forecasted credit environment recognition of the allowance increase has resulted in a billion aftertax decrease to retained earnings as you can see on the page also important to note we have elected to use the transition approach to recognize the impact on capital and now turning to the businesses well start with consumer community banking on page in the fourth quarter ccb generated net income of billion and an roe of with accelerating deposit growth of client investment assets up and total loans down for the full year results in ccb were strong with billion of net income up and an roe of on revenue of billion up fourth quarter revenue was billion up yearonyear in consumer business banking revenue was down driven by deposit margin compression largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher noninterest revenue on the increase in client investment assets as well as account and transaction growth home lending revenue was down driven by lower nii on lower balances which were down reflecting prior loan sales and lower net servicing revenue predominantly offset by higher net production revenue reflecting a increase in originations and in card merchant services auto revenue was up driven by higher card nii on loan growth as well as the impact of higher auto lease volumes card loan growth was with sales up reflecting a strong and confident consumer during the holiday season expenses of billion were up driven by revenuerelated costs from higher volumes as well as continued investments in the business including market expansion largely offset by expense efficiencies on credit this quarter ccb had a net reserve release of million this included a release in the home lending purchase creditimpaired portfolio of million reflecting improvements in delinquencies and home prices which was partially offset by a reserve build in card of million driven by growth net chargeoffs were billion largely driven by card and consistent with expectations jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 now turning to the corporate investment bank on page for the fourth quarter cib reported net income of billion and an roe of on revenue of billion a strong finish to the year for the full year cib delivered record revenue of billion and an roe of in investment banking ib fees reached an alltime record for the full year we maintained our number rank in global ib fees and grew share to its highest level in a decade for the quarter ib revenue of billion was up yearonyear outperforming the market which was flat advisory fees were down following a record performance last year on a sequential quarter basis fees were up meaningfully as we benefited from the closing of some large transactions and for the year we ranked number and gained share debt underwriting fees were up yearonyear due to higher bond issuance activity as clients accelerated their funding to take advantage of attractive pricing conditions to strengthen their balance sheets and for the year we maintained our number rank overall and we were number for leadleft positions in both high yield bonds and leveraged loans equity underwriting fees were up yearonyear reflecting strong performance in the us and latin america the new issuance market continued to be active and for the year we ranked number in equity underwriting as well as ipos our overall pipeline continues to be healthy as strategic dialogue with clients is constructive equity markets remain receptive to new issuance and the rate environment is favorable for debt issuance moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear driven by record fourth quarter revenue in both fixed income and equity markets fixed income markets was up benefiting from a favorable comparison against a challenging fourth quarter last year but also reflecting strength across businesses notably in securitized products and rates driven by strong client activity and monetizing flows equity markets was up driven by strength across cash and prime treasury services revenue was billion down yearonyear primarily due to deposit margin compression which was largely offset by organic growth while securities services revenue was billion up expenses of billion were up compared to the prior year with higher legal volume and revenuerelated expenses as well as continued investments now moving on to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of million and an roe of for the fourth quarter and for the year billion of net income and an roe of fourth quarter revenue of billion was down yearonyear with lower deposit nii on lower margins largely offset by higher deposit fees and a gain on a strategic investment gross investment banking revenues were million up yearonyear driven by increased large deal activity full year ib revenue was a record billion up on strong activity across segments with record results for both middle market and corporate client banking expenses of million were up yearonyear driven by continued investments in banker coverage and technology deposit balances were up yearonyear as we continued to see strong client flows loan balances were up yearonyear ci loans were up driven by growth in specialized industries and expansion markets partially offset by the runoff in our taxexempt portfolio cre loans were up where we continue to see higher originations in commercial term lending driven by the low rate environment offset by declines in real estate banking as we remain selective given where we are in the cycle finally credit costs were million with an nco rate of basis points largely driven by a single name which was reserved for in prior quarters underlying credit performance continues to be strong jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 now on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management reported net income of million with pretax margin of and roe of for the fourth quarter and for the year awm generated net income of billion with both pretax margin and roe of revenue of billion for the quarter was up yearonyear as the impact of higher investment valuations and average market levels as well as deposit and loan growth were partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear and for the quarter we saw net longterm inflows of billion driven by fixed income and multiasset and we had net liquidity inflows of billion aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion both records were up and respectively driven by higher market levels as well as continued net inflows into longterm and liquidity products deposits were up yearonyear driven by growth in interestbearing products and finally we had record loan balances up with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending now on to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was a loss of million for the current quarter driven by approximately million of net markdowns on certain legacy private equity investments sequentially revenue was down million due to lower rates the benefit recorded in the prior quarter related to loan sales as well as the pe losses i just mentioned yearonyear revenue was down also primarily driven by lower rates expenses of million were down million yearonyear due to the timing of our contributions to the foundation in the prior year and turning to page for the outlook at investor day as always well give you more information on the fullyear outlook however for now ill provide some color and reminders about the first quarter we expect nii to be approximately billion market dependent adjusted expenses to be about billion and as a reminder the effective tax rate in the first quarter is typically impacted by stock compensation adjustments and as a result is currently estimated to be approximately with the managed tax rate about to basis points higher so to wrap up was a year of record financial performance across revenue net income and eps our outlook heading into is constructive underpinned by the strength of the us consumer and despite expected slower global growth and the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainties we remain wellpositioned as we continue to build on our scale and benefit from the diversification of our business model and with that operator please open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 question and answer section operator first question comes from ken usdin of jefferies jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning hi jenn how are you jenn i was wondering on terms of the nii outlook you talked about the billion level obviously getting to a point of stability can you help us outside of day count can you help us understand just where we are in terms of repricing of the balance sheet what happens if rates generally stay flat from here just in terms of the rate side of the equation if we hold volume aside jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure as we look at rates paid on the retail side we didnt obviously have reprice on the way up and so theres little to do on the way down in fact there from a rates paid perspective we continued in the fourth quarter to see rates paid tick up a little bit on migration from savings to cds and then on the wholesale side we did see rates paid come down as you would expect and we did see betas accelerate after the second cut so there we saw more of a decline in cib than we did in cb or awm as you might expect importantly though as we always say on the wholesale side we price client by client and so were not going to lose any valuable client relationships over a few ticks of beta and then i would just say in terms of the outlook with the fed on hold the implieds do still have one cut later in and based on the latest implieds well give you more detail at investor day as we always do but i would say nii for the full year of flat to slightly down as the headwinds from rates will be offset with balance growth ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes got it and just one question on just the volume side of things ex the mortgage loans sales last year you were still in that like core growth and obviously talk a lot about the environment and how theres been some settling out but at a lower level just whats the status of just corporate and commercial customers now that were closer to phase one getting finalized umca is on the table whats the backdrop of just economic activity as you guys see it jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so the fourth quarter definitely i would say stabilized seems trade certainly stabilized things broadly speaking stopped getting worse and so we saw sentiment improve a bit which i think contributed to the overall success of the fourth quarter and then certainly there are some puts and takes jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 the us consumer remains in very strong shape both from a credit perspective sentiment spending obviously labor markets very strong and the fed and the ecb on hold and then capital spending is still a bit soft but sentiment is at least certainly better than it was six months ago so we have a broadly speaking constructive outlook as were heading into here operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i have a question on credit and cecl and you guys have been pretty clear that your business decisions are based on economic outcomes and not accounting outcomes but cecl does materially change the way in which timing change the timing in which earnings accrete to book value and capital obviously with a higher upfront hit but you guys have also been shifting your loan book pretty materially towards cards which have a much higher loss content than your total book so i guess twofold question one is how do we think about provisioning in this context should we think provisioning is going to be well above chargeoffs as your reserve ratio moves up because i would think your alll ratio postcecl adoption which i think is about it should move up as cards which have a much higher loss content and that continue to grow in the mix so just how do we think about provisioning in the context of the mix shift and cecls adoption and then i guess secondly if there is a change in the macro environment and the credit environment does get worse and cecl that inflection goes through your reserves and your provisioning is there a point where cecl actually does change the way you think about pricing and underwriting in that environment jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill start with the provisioning so look i think its fair to say under cecl you could have incremental volatility given that reserves are more dependent on specific macroeconomic forecasts but there that would depend of course on our ability to have foresight into the timing and extent of those downturns in card specifically as you say in any one period of growth or a downturn you could see an increase in reserves in the sense that were taking life of loan versus the next or months so thats true and then on the wholesale side you could see some differences of course because there are modeling differences between specific macroeconomic forecasts and through the cycle having said that we continue to believe that that incremental volatility would be material sic immaterial for us and of course net chargeoffs are not changing saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and then from a pricing perspective we dont foresee in the near term any pricing changes the cash flows with the customer have not changed and so we dont see any but it is true as you rightly point out that there is an increased cost of equity in the sense that were taking reserves upfront versus through time so over time you could see that but were not expecting it in the near term jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it i guess on the provisioning side my question is more just on an ongoing basis as the mix changes more towards higher loss content lending which obviously has higher margins and higher profitability over the course of the loan in theory but like in that context is it fair to say your provisioning levels also could be materially above your chargeoffs because i would think that your reserve ratios your alll ratios do have to move up as that mix changes on your balance sheet jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co it could be it could be of course saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so thats just timing particularly on the card side its just timing saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co but its difficult to know again because it relies on our ability to have perfect foresight into the timing and extent of a downturn saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it no thats fair thanks a lot appreciate it jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure operator our next question comes from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch so i was hoping to get a little bit more credit on what happened in the quarter to produce such stellar results understand that obviously the fourth quarter comp was light but billion is still a pretty heavy number for a fourth quarter for jpmorgan so any color you could provide would be very helpful jennifer jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so youre talking about markets erika erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch markets thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay sure so there at goldman in early december i did say we expected to be up meaningfully i would say the performance was broadbased in rates we call out securitized products im sorry in fixed income we call out securitized products and rates which were bright spots but broadly speaking obviously equities had a very strong quarter as well so its really across the franchise and we saw very strong client flow and we had success monetizing those flows so just a very healthy environment for us and really strong performance erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it my followup question is that a quarter ago or two quarters ago the revenue backdrop for banks in general or the outlook was starting to deteriorate and i think management gave us some color that youll continue to invest your efficiencies and initiatives no matter what the changes are in the revenue environment but you could cut back on certain expenses if revenue environment was changing that being said your revenue production seems to always outperform to the upside so as you think about is the best way to think about expenses just that overhead ratio jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so look on the efficiency ratio i would say that we run the company with great discipline whether its relentlessly pursuing expense efficiencies or investing with discipline through the cycle but because the efficiency ratio is an outcome not an input and is about expenses and revenue were not going to give a target for any one year we think about operating leverage over time and as we always say were not going to change the way we run the company for what could be temporary revenue headwinds and on expenses i would just say that at investor day last year marianne told you that we expected the cost curve to flatten post in adjusted expenses were up we expect them to be up less than that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc is jamie on the call jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co he is mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc im sorry jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes he is mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so just a question for jamie because in the first paragraph you mentioned easing trade issues helped market activity and i know this is a very simple question but can you talk about the connection between easing trade issues and better trading and you said that was better toward the end of the year is this something that you expect to remain or is this a oneoff quarter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thats a really hard question to answer mike so obviously trade caused a lot of consternation that has eased off a little bit i dont think its going to completely go away because you still have potential ongoing trade issues with china and europe and stuff like that but i think because that sentiment got better trading got better but how long that continues we dont know mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then jennifer you mentioned expense growth was it should be less than that this year you guys had also mentioned that your technology spending might be leveling off so as that levels off maybe you see jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 paybacks from prior investments any sense of where tech spending will be this year versus the prior year and how you think about that and i know well get more at investor day jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure of course so i think you can think about tech spending on a fully loaded basis being in line with what i described for the company and we continue to realize efficiencies from investments in tech but as you well know we continuously invest in tech and so theres a fair amount of velocity in the investment portfolio there as investments roll off and were investing in new technology and innovation so you can think about tech spending as being broadly in line with how i described the company in terms of trend operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one on asset growth in the last couple of years fourth quarter you have to go through this exercise of trying to squeeze down to hit the gsib target and then in addition this year i think you sold some residential mortgage loans to investors or at least the investors are taking the risk of it and then youre requesting to have regulatory capital reflect that transfer of risk to an investor pool while youre keeping the customer relationship when i see these things im wondering how youre thinking about how much room you have for asset growth as we go into and is there an opportunity to potentially do more of this residential mortgage loan trade to free up space for growth maybe you could speak to that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so were bound by standardized capital and so of course that is a consideration for us and one of the reasons that were looking to structure loan sales as you described in the mortgage business so we think that theres more we can do there and then on gsib we remain hopeful that we will see the refinements there and recalibration that the fed has been talking about for some time because that will become increasingly difficult so both are at the margin constraints for us but broadly speaking i wouldnt say that were constrained given where we are on our capital ratios betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 and as i think about cecl appreciate the commentary you had earlier on the call im just wondering a couple of things one why do you think you ended up towards the low end of your billion to billion increase in reserves that you outlined earlier and what kind of estimates you have for the economic outlook youve got the assumption for the economic outlook in the reasonable supportable period et cetera and so im just trying to understand what kind of forecast you have in your model so that i understand whats embedded in your scenarios and in your allr ratio jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so i think we ended up at the low end as we through the year continued to get more certainty around what the macroeconomic forecasts were going to look like and so i think thats really whats driving it obviously portfolio mix as well continued to be very strong in terms of performance of the portfolio and then on the estimates for the economic outlook as you rightly say there is the reasonable and supportable period which for us is two years and so we do use multiple weighted scenarios there so we weight multiple scenarios with the one most likely getting the greatest weight and thats where you end up with what looks like a reasonably benign outlook for the reasonable and supportable period which also obviously would contribute to us hitting the low end of the range jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and jenn are we going to disclose some of those variables over time jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats a great point jamie i shouldve said that yes there will be more disclosure about cecl in the q for the first quarter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co this means all the banks are going to be showing these ridiculous forecasts and going forward and the differences and will spend time talking about that as opposed to the actual business jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but well disclose what you need to know to make it clear what were doing and why were doing it jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats right so youll see more in the qs jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 operator our next question is from matt oconnor from deutsche bank matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi matt matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc two quick followups to some themes that have been talked about i guess first on expenses the full year outlook was pretty clear less than growth but the first quarter seems a little bit higher than maybe i would have thought up yearoveryear and i dont know if thats just rounding and im getting too obsessed over million here or there or if youre upfunding some investment spend and if so what thats for jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so the first quarter tends to be a bit higher for us if you look through history and so but there you can think about it comparing it yearoveryear we have volume and revenuerelated expenses increasing a bit of an increase on investments but both are being partially offset by expense efficiencies matthew derek oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then the other followup question is just on capital allocation obviously its a good problem to have but the ratios keep going up the capital generation keeps going up the stock keeps going up youre obviously buying back a lot of stock the goal is to get the dividend i think higher over time but maybe just talk about how you think about buying back stock at these levels if theres other call it creative uses of capital like i always think about all the money you spend on technology does it make sense to buy technology versus do it organic so just maybe address some of those things thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so on the ratio ill just remind you that of course we have our capital distribution plan approved once a year and so since our last ccar filing we have realized some rwa efficiency and weve outearned relative to the assumptions in the ccar filing and so thats part of the reason why weve seen the ratios float up there on stock buybacks as you rightly point out our first priority is always going to be to invest for organic growth and so we are always looking to do that first and foremost and then to have a competitive and sustainable dividend and only then to distribute excess capital to shareholders through buybacks and we have said that it makes sense to continue to do that at or above times tangible book which is about where we are now we will obviously when distributing excess capital always be looking at the alternatives but at a rotce and or dividend payout ratio sic dividend yield there is a high bar for the alternatives jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 operator our next question comes from jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and youre absolutely right about acquisitions we did do instamed this year which is an electronic system that hooks up providers and consumers of healthcare i think the number is like or are still done by check so if there are opportunities like that we absolutely would be on the hunt for them jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats right and wepay last year yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and wepay the year before jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jennifer jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc question on credit you obviously put up some real good numbers once again on credit quality and i noticed that you had a nice material decline in the wholesale nonperforming assets quartertoquarter can you give us any color on what brought that down and could you tie in also any concerns that you may have about the energy portfolio i know its not material but there is some concerns out there about energy credits jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so on wholesale nonperforming loans in the cib that was some namespecific upgrades that we had in the cib and then in the commercial bank that was related to chargeoffs taken in the quarter and then on energy really nothing there thematically i would say like any sector we have upgrades and downgrades and this quarter was no exception but i wouldnt say anything thematically in our portfolio that were concerned about jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i dont know if i heard you correctly on the last answer to the stock repurchase program i understand of course its driven by your ccar results but if the price of the stock and its a good problem to have gets to a level that you consider to be too high i think you may have said times tangible book value what then happens if the price ever gets to a point where you guys think its just too high to buy it back what do you do with the excess capital at that point have you given that much again its a good problem to have i understand that but have you given any thought to that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure we give a lot of thought to it and i agree it is a highclass problem and so weve said that at or above times tangible book makes sense if it continues to go up were going to continue to look at alternatives most importantly within the company in terms of how we should really think about the returns on buying our stock back at a higher level versus perhaps thinking about the returns a bit differently in terms of organic growth jamie i dont know if theres anything you want to add jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no you said it all operator our next question is from steven chubak of wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning so jennifer wanted to start with a question on capital quarles indicated in a recent interview that he plans to implement the bulk of the scb in ccar also alluded to the possibility of deploying a countercyclical buffer as part of that im just wondering if the countercyclical buffer is actually deployed or incorporated within the test is that something thats underwritten as part of your cet1 target and are you anticipating changes to the gsib coefficient calculations that you alluded to earlier in the call as part of the coming cycle as well jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks steven so you touched on a number of things that are all important and i think whats most important to us is that we end up with a cohesive framework across all of them the comments from the vice chair have been constructive in the sense that he always reiterates that he thinks the level of capital in the system is about right and so well have a firmer view when we see a final rule as you say we do expect to see something in based upon the comments that we have heard just like you have and we expect that our target will not be impacted because we do constructively hear the vice chair say over and over that the amount of capital in the system is about right and then but we cant have a firm view until we see the final rule jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 and then on gsib we remain hopeful that were going to see the refinement that the fed has been talking about perhaps not full recalibration until basel iv which is what the vice chair recently said but certainly there are a number of refinements that weve been talking about and the fed has been talking about for years and we remain hopeful that well see them very soon steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that color jennifer and just one final one from me we saw really strong ficc results as well as really strong institutional deposit growth and i was hoping you could speak to what impact the fed balance sheet growth is actually having on all of your different businesses or how thats manifesting because it seems to be providing a pretty nice tailwind whether its some increased activity as well as some benefit in terms of deposit growth that youre seeing across the overall franchise but institutional in particular jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so youre absolutely right on the wholesale side the fed balance sheet expansion was for sure a tailwind for us although i would say the more meaningful portion of our deposit growth on the wholesale side in the quarter was from strong organic growth in client acquisition audio gap and it was a tailwind and elsewhere i would say obviously it was the right thing to do and provided stability in the repo markets throughout the quarter operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning quick question on the deposit cost could you just break down maybe by segment where the big drivers were that you saw had the big reduction in deposit costs linked quarter was that in securities services was it wealth management jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure sure brian so on that ill start with retail where we saw rates paid tick up a bit and thats on migration from savings to cds we have seen cd pricing come off its peak but continued migration from savings to cds and then on the wholesale side you see bigger declines in rates paid in treasury services for sure and then a little bit less so in the commercial bank and awm and again as we always say these are namespecific client byclient decisions and while we feel good about where we are these are decisions we make client by client and were certainly careful and have a lot of discipline not going to lose valuable relationships over a few ticks of beta brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and then a separate question in the commercial bank youve seen loans come down quarteronquarter for end of period and generally modest growth yearoveryear whats the sentiment now in the middle market and the corporate client is it a sentiment issue is it just a timing issue there from seeing better loan growth jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 sure so there are obviously some puts and takes which ill run through but broadly speaking i would say what were seeing is more a function of our own discipline than it is a function of demand and in ci we feel good about the growth that were seeing in the areas where were focused in specialized industries and market expansion but of course thats offset partially by the taxexempt portfolio thats running off and then in cre good growth in commercial term lending as we continue to have opportunities there given the rate environment and then that is offset by real estate banking where we are very disciplined given where we are in the cycle jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i would just add when capital expenditures come down all things being equal which theyre not but all things being equal youll see a reduction in some lending because companies need less money to pay out receivables and inventory and plant and equipment operator our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore isi jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there hi quick question on open apis and what the big picture is here and how it impacts you and the rest of the banking industry meaning theres concerns over data security and things like that but jpmorgan has plenty of agreements with some of the bigger providers so im just curious to get your big picture thoughts on what level concern should we have whats the good and the bad jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah there i would say glenn our customers data privacy and security is of utmost importance to us and we think over time the best way for us to do that as securely as we can is to have thirdparty apps only access data through our apis and so we are working name by name to get those agreements in place and we hope through time that is exclusively the only way that third parties can access our customers data we think thats the most secure way to do it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but very importantly is that that data is the data the customer agrees to give them on the basis they agree to give it to them so its not unlimited access to customer data and the customer will have the ability to turn it off as opposed to today if you gave your bank pass code to someone theyre taking your data every day maybe even every minute and you dont even know about it because you forgot jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats a great point and were going to make it super easy for our customers to be able to do that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi so you will give them the tools to control that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes you can imagine a dashboard where they will have jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co that is the full intent jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i got it and then just curious if youve seen any followon impacts youve seen repricing on parts of the illiquid markets and for specifically some of the unprofitable parts of those companies and is that just a repricing and everybody that owns them will take some hits a little bit slower progress on banking front and thats it or is there anything bigger there to worry about with whats going on in the illiquid side jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co are you talking about the private companies glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yes i am sorry jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay yeah look there are a lot of private companies a lot of them do well some dont some will fail some have access to capital now and they wont have access to capital in a downturn but its not a systemic issue its just the capital markets there are a lot of private companies and so i dont think its that big a deal you just have an adjustment in access to capital that will happen periodically operator our next question is from marty mosby of vining sparks marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp thank you jennifer you were kind of foreshadowing a lower tax rate as you kind of move into the first quarter and then the tax rate here in the fourth quarter was a little bit lower than what we expected is there anything thats permanent here are there some things that are just kind of rolling through these two quarters jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i wouldnt say theres anything permanent there the first quarter is typically lower for us marty you can think about full year as being plus or minus and of course that would depend on any nonrecurring items we might have or any change in regulation but plus or minus and then of course the managed tax rate is typically to basis points higher than that marty mosby q analyst vining sparks ibg lp and then a bigger question when we came into the net interest margin was around and then now as were coming out of the net interest margin has fallen below so interest rates went up basis points and then down basis points and weve netted down a negative basis points so i was just curious in that path its either the way the fed kind of inflected very quickly that created a little bit more pressure in the net between deposit pricing and loan pricing or do we think that this is probably just some of the competition that came in after the tax reform and maybe this is just the evidence of some of that competition with the increased profitability that we got from the benefit from the taxes jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so there i would say marty on that sort of the last several hikes there was some catchup there because we had some lags on reprice in the rising rate environment so if youre just looking at the last few hikes the betas would certainly be higher than what were seeing in terms of the first three eases here but broadly speaking on nim we dont nim is an outcome for us not an input and as we think about looking forward certainly the environment is very competitive it always has been and nii the outlook for is at this point based upon the implied flat to slightly down and we do expect balance sheet growth operator our next question is from andrew lim of société générale andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi morning thanks for taking my questions wondering if you can give a bit more color on your markets performance there obviously its done very well geographically though is there much more weighting there on the us versus europe and apac jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i would say andrew that it was broadbased we can have jason and team follow up specifically on a geographic breakdown but it was largely broadbased andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk right and would you say with confidence that youre gaining market share in both territories there jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co again i dont have the split on market share by region but jason and team can certainly follow up on that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah im not sure we want to start disclosing that regularly jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but i do believe that market share went up in pretty much in most markets but you cant say most markets in all products jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator and our next question is from alison williams of bloomberg intelligence alison williams q analyst bloomberg lp research good morning so i had a similar question just circling back to trading and the cib more broadly so obviously the bank has gained share but can you speak to future opportunities and runway and maybe this is more of a question for investor day but specifically businesses like cash management transaction banking and corporate clients in general youre a leader in the us anecdotally we hear us banks have been making gains in europe can you speak at all to that opportunity jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so as you said well give you more color at investor day for the treasury services business we feel really good about where were positioned i think going forward there will obviously be some rate headwinds there which we think can be offset by organic growth but given the investments that we have made there jamie mentioned instamed earlier we feel really good about the capabilities that were adding and what were seeing in terms of organic growth there but we can talk to you more about that at investor day alison williams q analyst bloomberg lp research okay thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14jan2020 jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay thanks everyone jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer
