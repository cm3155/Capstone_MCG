management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases third quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please standby at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jennifer piepszak ms piepszak please go ahead jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone ill take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and revenue of billion with a return on tangible common equity of included in these results are million of legal expenses primarily related to the resolution of legal matters announced last month overall for the quarter while were still in a very uncertain environment our underlying business fundamentals performed quite well so ill just touch on a few highlights here before getting into the lineofbusiness results the cib continued its strong performance with ib fees up and markets revenue up yearonyear and we had record revenue in awm up yearonyear on deposits while we expected to see some normalization in our balances instead we saw another quarter of growth with average deposits up sequentially and notably we moved into the number spot in us retail deposits with market share gaining basis points of share yearonyear on the other hand average loans were down quarteronquarter primarily on revolver paydowns from our wholesale clients with that lets turn to page for more detail on the third quarter results we reported revenue of billion which was flat yearonyear net interest income was down approximately billion or on lower rates partly offset by higher markets nii and balance sheet growth and noninterest revenue was up billion or primarily driven by cib including higher banking and markets revenues as well as net securities gains in corporate expenses of billion were up approximately million or yearonyear on the higher legal expenses that i already mentioned this quarter credit costs of approximately million were down million yearon year primarily driven by modest reserve releases which you can see in more detail on page we released approximately million of reserves this quarter primarily on runoff in home lending and changes in wholesale loan exposure chargeoffs across our portfolios remained relatively low and in fact were down slightly yearonyear and quarteronquarter while we could see an uptick in chargeoffs over the next few quarters given payment relief and government stimulus already provided we dont expect any meaningful increases in chargeoffs until the second half of as you can see at the bottom of the page our updated base case reflects some improvement from last quarter however the medium to longer term is still highly uncertain in particular as it relates to future stimulus and so we jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios and with reserves of billion were prepared for something worse than the base case now turning to page ill provide a quick update on what were seeing in our customer assistance programs you can see here that the vast majority of card auto customers have exited the lease and so whats left in deferral is primarily inhome lending including billion of owned loans and billion in our service portfolio and in terms of what were seeing with our customers that have exited the lease approximately of accounts remain current now turning to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up basis points versus last quarter on earnings generation and lower rwa partially offset by dividends of billion and its worth noting that we have over trillion of liquidity sources available to us across hqla and unencumbered securities now lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page ccb reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was down yearonyear driven by deposit margin compression and lower card nii on lower balances partially offset by deposit growth and strong home lending production margins deposit growth was yearonyear up over billion largely on lower spending and higher cash buffers across both our consumer and small business customers as well as organic growth client investment assets were up yearonyear driven by both net inflows and market performance overall consumer customers are holding up well they have built savings relative to precovid levels and at the same time lower debt balances with regard to digital adoption early signs suggest the increased customer migration to digital will persist in fact nearly of our customers are digitally active and thats up percentage points yearonyear and accelerating and quickdeposit now represents more than of all check deposits versus precovid moving on to consumer lending starting with home lending total originations were down yearonyear driven by correspondent however consumer volumes were up yearonyear and notably more than half of consumer applications were completed digitally twice the level of the first quarter in card while net sales were down yearonyear spend continued to improve throughout the quarter and in the month of september sales were down only yearonyear reflecting the lowest decline since march retail which is a significant portion of overall spend was a bright spot reaching doubledigit yearonyear growth in the third quarter largely driven by card not present transactions and then in auto record originations for the quarter of billion were up yearonyear total ccb loans were down yearonyear with home lending down due to portfolio runoff and card down on lower spend offset by business banking up due to ppp loans expenses of billion were down predominantly due to lower marketing investments and lastly credit costs of million included a million reserve release in home lending and net charge offs of billion driven by card now turning to the corporate investment bank on page cib reported net income of billion and an roe of on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear and down sequentially off an alltime record quarter and we maintained our number rank in ib fees yeartodate the quarters performance was largely driven by our equity capital markets business which saw an uptick in ipo issuance driven by a strong equity backdrop with stocks trading at or near alltime highs jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 in advisory we were down yearonyear largely impacted by the muted ma announced volumes in the first half of the year however we saw a surge in ma activity this quarter with announced volumes returning to pre covid levels as companies began to shift their focus from daytoday operations to more strategic and opportunistic thinking debt underwriting fees were up yearonyear but down sequentially as we saw investment grade activity return to more normalized levels from the record volumes we saw in the second quarter the leveraged finance market continued to recover with highyield spreads approaching precovid levels and some notable acquisition financing deals closing we maintain our number rank in overall wallet and were the leaders in lead left across leveraged finance in equity underwriting fees were up yearonyear resulting in the best third quarter ever primarily driven by our strong performance in ipos and followons in terms of the outlook we expect fourth quarter ib fees to be roughly flat versus the strong quarter last year and down sequentially however if valuations remain elevated we could continue to see momentum in capital markets moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear while activity continued to normalize with spreads volumes and volatility reducing from the elevated levels of the first half of the year the performance was strong throughout the quarter and across products reflecting a resilience in earnings power of this franchise through a broad range of market conditions fixed income was up yearonyear against a strong third quarter last year driven by a favorable trading environment across products notably in commodities as well as elevated client activity in credit and securitized products equities was up yearonyear on continued robust client activity in equity derivatives as well as a recovery in prime balances and a solid performance in cash looking forward its important to remember that performance was very strong making for a difficult yearonyear comparison and obviously forecasting markets performance remains challenging in this environment wholesale payments revenue of billion was down yearonyear driven by deposit margin compression largely offset by balance growth as well as a reporting reclassification in merchant services securities services revenue of billion was flat yearonyear where higher deposit balances were offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up compared to the prior year largely due to higher legal expense partially offset by lower structural and volume and revenuerelated expenses now moving on to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was flat yearonyear driven by deposit margin compression offset by higher balances and fees and higher lending revenue gross investment banking revenue of million was up yearonyear on increased debt and equity underwriting activity expenses of million were up yearonyear average loans were up yearonyear but down quarteronquarter due to declines in revolver utilization by ci clients and lower origination volume in cre deposits of billion were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter as client balances remain elevated finally credit costs were a net benefit of million including a million reserve release and net chargeoffs of million jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 now on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management reported net income of million with pretax margin of and roe of record revenue of billion for the quarter was up yearonyear as growth in deposit and loan balances along with higher management fees and brokerage activity were largely offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were flat yearonyear and credit costs were a net benefit of million primarily due to reserve releases for the quarter net longterm inflows of billion were positive across all channels and driven by fixed income and equity at the same time we saw net liquidity outflows of billion aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by net inflows into liquidity and longterm products as well as higher market levels and finally deposits were up yearonyear and loans were up with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending now on to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of approximately million revenue was a loss of million down billion yearoveryear driven by lower net interest income on lower rates including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities partially offset by million of net securities gains in the quarter and expenses of million were up million yearonyear primarily due to an impairment on a legacy investment now lets turn to page for the outlook youll see here that our full year outlook for remains in line with what i said at barclays we expect net interest income to be approximately billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately billion and while we dont have anything on the page for and were not planning to do investor day well share more color with you on the outlook in the first quarter of next year so to wrap up even though recent economic data has been more constructive than we would have expected earlier this year there remains a significant amount of uncertainty and so we continue to prepare for a broad range of outcomes while focusing on serving our customers clients and communities through this time with that operator please open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from matthew oconnor of deutsche bank matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi matt matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so i think one of the key questions on investors minds right now is how will banks grow revenue kind of medium term here as you think about lowerforlonger rates and i was hoping you could just talk about how you think about managing the company if rates stay very low for a long time and how you can grow revenue and obviously yeartodate the revenues been very good up and if you could just weave in the branch expansion that you alluded to in the comments as part of that answer that would be helpful thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so in terms of how we think about the revenue outlook for first of all its early and well come back to you in the first quarter with more details but it is true that if we think about the nii outlook that that will be under pressure relative to and i can give more detail on that but also we are on pace for record revenue in markets and investment banking and so that will be a tough compare having said that were not going to change the way we run the company because of what might be temporary rate headwinds and we see significant franchise value in the growth that were seeing in the deposit base and with that branch expansion we are continuing on our plans in branch expansion we have i think almost branches open in our expansion markets well do more than another sic so far this year we got approval to enter additional states which will ultimately put us in all lower so we continue with the branch expansion and remain very excited about it with those new branches in most cases performing well above the original business case jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and can i just add to that to give you a little bit of a longerterm view theres not one single business where not any bankers countries products digital are growing securities services and cash management services were growing the chase wealth management business were adding private bankers were adding products and asset management and we kind of look through all of the things i kind of call them the weather we just keep on growing the branch expansion is one example of that we never stopped doing that we never stopped getting credit card products we never stopped growing digital home lending products and well be doing that for the next decade and of course youll have all those ins and outs from what i call the weather nii jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 spreads margins markets et cetera but the goal is always the same you grow the business to serve your clients around the world matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just as a follow up jenn you said that youd elaborate on the net interest income i dont know if you meant now or youre going to wait till january for that in terms of the outlook for next year some of the puts and takes jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so there i had said at barclays that the current run rate was a good place to start so billion is a good place to start and for reflects the impact of the rate environment and some normalization in markets nii but from there balance sheet growth and mix should be supportive throughout the year and so for the full year of my best view at this point would be billion plus or minus but yeah well sharpen our pencils on that and continue to provide updates but right now full year billion operator our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi good morning so i guess the reserve release was definitely driven by mortgage prepay and runoff so i get that but npas were still up quarteronquarter i wonder if you could talk about what drove that maybe comment on commercial real estate specifically would be appreciated thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so the reserve release as you said was largely on portfolio runoff and changes in exposure in wholesale so not a reflection of a change in our outlook and then the increase in nonaccrual loans on the consumer side is mortgage and it represents the customers that have come out of forbearance and are not paying and so as you saw on that slide the payment deferral slide about are still current the other have now been reflected in the nonaccrual exposure so that is all mortgage and then the increase in nonaccrual on the wholesale side was just a few namespecific downgrades which are in sectors you would expect as you just said retailrelated real estate and oil and gas and then more broadly on commercial real estate ill just share that we feel adequate reserve for what were facing but if you look at rent collections as an example overall with the exception of retail between and and then even retail in the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 month of september was about had recovered to about so still a lot of uncertainty there but we feel adequately reserved glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay i appreciate that maybe one on asset management youve been doing great i dont need to ask on your specific business but in the past youve spoken about potential interest in participating in industry consolidation we saw some of that happening lately can you just talk remind us about the parameters of what you would and might not be interested in doing in asset wealth management thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well since we have you on the line our doors and our telephone lines are wide open we would be very interested in and we do think youll see consolidation of the business but were not going to be more specific than that the product has to fit the system the technology the business logic the ability to execute there are a lot of issues thatll determine whether something makes sense for us or not operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi hey jenn and jamie that was some comment you said you do not expect much higher chargeoffs until the second half of next year and thats even with the higher npas so what are your assumptions behind that jenn as far as specifically when the forbearance actions run their course and jamie policy actions that might be embedded in that expectation jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay so ill just start mike with first of all the increase in nonaccrual was on mortgage and when you look at the ltv the loan to value on those loans thats what is embedded in how were thinking about what chargeoffs will look like in the near term theyre still very healthy ltvs on those loans so really when we talk about losses really emerging in a significant way not until the back half of were talking about card and just given the amount of stimulus and payment relief and just support in the system we havent seen the delinquency buckets begin to fill up and we charge days past due in card so that is primarily just a timing issue as it relates to card we could see increases in chargeoffs in the next few quarters on the wholesale side or maybe here and there on the consumer side its just that the meaningful change in chargeoffs we dont expect until the second half of jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and mike about policy first of all i wouldnt say that policy is determined this year because this is unprecedented times and what were saying is that policy will matter and will skew the odds in favor of better outcomes so i think the policy obviously the feds doing what it can to keep markets open but the policy on the fiscal side is there some kind of continuation of unemployment insurance and ppp those are the two most vulnerable areas so just maximize the chance that well have better outcomes jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 and i do think that over time intelligent return to work i caution people remember million people go to work every day so the complete focus is on the million who dont go to work but the million who go to work its rather safe theres a lot of examples where you have to do the social distancing the cleaning and all the various things like that it may be safer than being home in your community and so but getting back to work is a little bit important because if you look at cities and travel and a whole bunch of stuff there are a lot of people who are under a lot of stress and strain who wont be able to survive another year of complete closedown so the other policy is a new immersed rational thoughtful return to the office done properly which will help all those businesses support the big office towers and buildings and stuff like that and most of the things will maximize the chance of a good outcome they dont guarantee the chance of a good outcome mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i know this is a tough question but youre in the middle of the stress test part when all is said and done jamie or jenn where do you think these chargeoffs go as a percentage of the global financial crisis you have to have i know you have scenarios but where should we be thinking is it like half the gfc level same gfc level twice the gfc level what are you guys thinking in the back of your mind jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i think its a very difficult question to answer its very different of course because the gfc was heavily mortgagerelated and this will probably be less so we also our portfolios are in significantly better shape coming into this whether its mortgage or card but just given the amount of uncertainty about where this could go we still have million people unemployed i think its very difficult i dont know jamie whether you would add jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its very hard i agree with you jenn its very hard to say and mike it depends on the outcome again we look at the good case the medium case the relative adverse case and the extreme adverse case and there the answers are completely different and we dont know the future so its hard to predict what its going to be but our reserves are prepared for a relative adverse case which is equal to the roughly equivalent to the ccar extreme adverse case that we just got roughly again its very hard to compare applestoapples in these things operator our next question is from erika najarian of bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning im going to ask the two questions that i often get from investors that are hesitant to dip their toe back into bank stocks and the first is and jenn this goes back to your earlier comment the one question i get on credit quality is did stimulus and policy redefine cumulative credit losses lower for this cycle in other words i think jamie said change the outcome or do you think it just delayed the realization of these losses jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 so i think its difficult to know i think the purpose of it was to change the outcome not just delay the losses but its difficult to know people sort of described it as a bridge and the question as to whether the bridge will be long enough and strong enough to bridge people back to employment and bridge small businesses back to normalcy so i think it remains to be seen as jamie said were obviously preparing for it to not necessarily change the outcome obviously because weve built significant reserves so were prepared for it to be a delay rather than change the outcome erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and my followup question and perhaps if i could direct this to jamie this is a bit of a follow up to matts earlier question but investors are essentially worried on the other side of the credit recovery about what the interest rate environment may imply for normalized rotce and as you think about what you mentioned to be weather considerations what prevents jpmorgan from going back to that rotce that you posted in and jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co you get that a forecast of futures is hard to tell i think negative interest rates are a bad idea and will probably force over time the banking industry to shrink which means we wont be buying back stock and doing other things with our capital but were able to handle low rates and we can have decent returns at low rates i think its a bad longterm strategy i also think its a bad idea for you all to assume were going to continue like that forever and when we had massive global qe in the last goaround and we didnt have inflation so i remind people a lot of the qe was a round trip the fed and the central banks bought securities so that would create deposits for banks the banks are forced put deposits in the central banks so its not nearly as inflationary as fiscal stimulus fiscal stimulus which has been extraordinary around the world is by its nature inflationary and so we dont really know the outcome of that but my view and what i tell investors is were going to build our businesses day in and day out regardless of interest rate environments et cetera and we have plans to adjust interest rate environments we cannot do certain things we can charge for certain things we can do a whole bunch of different stuff but the services is still required moving money around the world trading for people underwriting securities and helping manage their money and well be okay well work through it operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning can you hear me jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 hi i had two questions one was id be interested in understanding how you are threading the needle between your outlook here for reserves and the potential to buy back stock youve got the reserve level high with a base case outlook for unemployment thats above where we are today for the next six months it looks like or even longer and your capital build is obviously continuing to increase here so how should we think about that could we imagine that your buyback could kick off before reserve release happens and would you release reserves before the net chargeoffs start to come through like you mentioned in the second half of jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so as we first of all on stock buybacks obviously we are restricted here in the fourth quarter we are hopeful that the fed will see what they need and get what they need in the resubmission to give them the confidence to revert to a more normal distribution framework under scb in the first quarter so thats obviously the most important hurdle for us and then if we have excess capital and the reserve decision and the buyback decision are not related to one another we are always going to make sure that we have our best estimate of losses that were facing considering the uncertainty as well and then of course our capital hierarchy would always look to grow our businesses first and foremost but if we have excess capital and if we do not have regulatory restrictions you could see us buy back stock as early as the first quarter and like i said that wouldnt necessarily be related to a reserve release the other thing on potential reserve releases we obviously need to see the economy continue to deliver on the base case to give us the confidence that that is what were dealing with but i would just say that remember there was a capital relief a partial capital relief on cecl build so when you release reserves only about half of that actually falls through to capital betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and could you talk a little jenn could you talk a little bit about the slide where youve got the base case outlook for unemployment and just give us a sense as to whats driving this base case outlook for unemployment in at and then at theyre obviously above where we are today and could you help us understand how youre thinking about flexing that going forward what would change those assumptions jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thats like largely betsy a timing issue with when we actually run the models for the reserve thats not necessarily as you rightly point out reflective of our economists latest outlook so we would as we progress through the fourth quarter use the latest outlook for the base case but then again as jamie said we look at a number of different scenarios and depending upon what we think were dealing with in terms of the uncertainty we may continue to heavily weight the downside scenarios or maybe even more heavily weight the downside scenarios we have to face so if you look at the weighted outcome of all of the scenarios that we use to drive the reserves we are prepared for a doubledigit unemployment peak unemployment level but it would start with the revised base case shall i say from our economists jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and can i just put into perspective just a little bit on capital we have extraordinary amounts of capital billion weve got trillion of liquid assets and securities and the way you should look at it is the billion in jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 the next eight quarters will earn ppnr like pretax preprovision earnings roughly billion give or take and we dont know exactly what thats going to be so with the billion if things get better itll be more than that and well take down reserves if they get worse maybe about that or even worse than that well have to put up billion even if you put up the billion in my view that wont emerge in the quarter that will emerge over several quarters which means you can pay the dividend buy back stock have plenty of capital and still be very conservatively capitalized and thats the reality of it okay forget all the other stuff you read and were conservative we like to be conservative regarding loan loss reserves and capital so well be patient but we have a tremendous amount of wherewithal to do both when the time comes i hope were allowed to do it before the stock is much higher jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and the billion that jamie references we talked about the extreme adverse scenario last quarter so you can think that thats the billion that jamie is referencing is that is what jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and that billion is unemployment of that goes up into the better part of six quarters its really extreme adverse its far worse than the ccar case we just got operator our next question is from john mcdonald of autonomous research john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research morning jenn you mentioned that next year you have some tough revenue comps can you talk about the notion of expense flexibility at jpmorgan underneath the surface of flattish expenses where are you on saving money from digitization and structural change and how does that give you flexibility against where youd like to be investing jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so first of all its early were still working through next year so i will certainly refine the guidance in the first quarter but as it relates to expenses we will and you mentioned digital thats one we will continue to deliver on structural expense efficiencies as we have been for the last several years there will as we do expect the world to normalize a bit there will be opportunity in volume and revenuerelated expenses but were going to continue to invest and so there will be puts and takes and well provide more detailed guidance in the first quarter john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and as a follow up on capital can you talk about the notion of reducing your scb and maybe your gsib surcharge footprint over time i think youve commented that theres potential to do that what is the path and the route to doing that and how do you feel about the prospects for those two things getting better over time jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill start with gsib which is that we do expect to be in the bucket at the end of this year but it is not effective immediately and so we will have to manage that back down what i would say there is that with the fed balance sheet at these levels possibly expanding that makes managing the gsib back down quite challenging so in the absence of recalibration which we remain hopeful about managing that back down will certainly be challenging but not impossible but well certainly think about any impact on our client franchise before we do anything so we have some time there we could see recalibration that would help but no doubt that thats a challenge on scb id start by saying its scenariodependent of course so all else equal we do think that we have opportunities to manage down the scb and that can include transferring securities from afs to heldtomaturity and then some other mechanical issues on our side that were confident will all things equal reduce our scb but again its scenario dependent so all that being said john i would just say that our expectation at this point over time is that our target capital level of to should be unchanged over time john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thanks operator our next question is from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning jenn jamie mentioned earlier that youve got trillion of cash and securities it didnt look like you really changed the size of the investment portfolio this quarter but you did make a bunch of moves into heldtomaturity from availableforsale and im just wondering you guys have talked about expectation that deposits might settle down but theyre continuing to grow and so what can you do at this point and going forward with starting to move some of that cash into things that might at least earn some more to protect the nii going forward thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just take that were not going to do anything to protect the nii we have billion of cash we can invest today and that becomes billion were not going to invest in stuff making or basis points so we get a teeny little bit more of nii were going to make longterm decisions for the company and if your nii in the end gets squeezed a little bit so be it but we dont want to be in a position where we lose a lot of money because we made investments in or 10year securities which youll lose a lot if rates go up so were not protecting nii jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so as a principal matter its important to remember that we manage the portfolio across multiple dimensions not just optimizing nii as jamie said and were thinking about capital protection at these levels but just in terms of the activity that you saw in the securities portfolio weve been very active we added about billion through the end of  in  we were active buyers and sellers because in  we saw attractive selling opportunities which made economic sense for us so just to jamies point so you give up some nii but it just made economic sense for us but we were also buying in the third quarter we also are focused on optimizing liabilities with the excess liquidity so youll see that our debt is down nearly billion from last quarter so then just in terms of the transfer to heldtomaturity with the significant growth in the securities portfolio it just made sense from a capital protection perspective its also helpful for scb as i mentioned and these were high quality core holdings ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and fully agree on that duration point jamie followup just on if you think about the fee businesses and some jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co you guys should also be raising the question about why moving something to heldtomaturity reduces scb like is that a rational thing which i dont think it is but thats what it is and thats what were going to deal with why we can drive down scb ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co on duration with the 10year has backed up a bit over the last couple of weeks and so well remain opportunistic but we have added at these levels ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great and then just one follow up on just fees in general youve got the consumer fee businesses that are still trying to get back to where they were a year ago and then last quarter jamie had made the comment about cut it in half and trading and it wasnt anywhere close to that which was positive its still quite quite good and just how you think through just pushes and pulls between fees as you look forward right in terms of how much better do you think the consumer can get from where it is and how much if any are the institutional businesses over earning relative to where they posted in the first half thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 sure so on consumer fees youll see that consumer fees recovered a bit in the third quarter the decline there was both relief actions that we took but also because of the higher cash buffers that consumers are experiencing that also impacts fees and thats a good thing so well take that so that did recover a bit in the third quarter but that will take time to get back to what you might consider normalized levels and then on the institutional side we did expect to see markets normalize in the third quarter we did see that a bit but not as much as we had thought when we were at second quarter earnings and ib fees also continued to be very strong in the third quarter exceeding our expectations for what we might have thought in the second quarter looking forward though the fourth quarter is a tough compare so we do and we do expect markets to continue to normalize and then on the ib fees side our pipeline is flattish to what it was last year its still down a bit in ma but we did see ma recover in the third quarter and its up in ecm so as i said flattish in the fourth quarter feels about right at this point operator our next question is from steve chubak of wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so jenn i was hoping you could speak to just expectations for loan growth across both the institutional and consumer channels when do you anticipate we could begin to see balances inflect positively and separately just what level of loan growth is contemplated in the billion nii guide that you provided for jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so loan growth will be challenged i think in the short term on the wholesale side i think well probably tread water at these levels but increasing ceo confidence with ma activity and capital investments should be supportive of more normalized loan growth but that may take some time on the consumer side we are seeing card continue to revert to more normal levels and so that will continue into but that could be offset by continued prepays in mortgage so there will be puts and takes there and then asset management i think will continue to see solid growth so netnet not significant loan growth but mix will be helpful because card growth is supportive of a mix benefit on nii steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that and maybe a question for you jamie you had alluded to a potential for charging for additional products and services to offset rate pressures and was hoping you could speak to some of the areas where you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 might look to potentially charge clients and just philosophically how youre handicapping the risk of client attrition if competitors ultimately dont follow suit jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hi steve first of all i dont think its going to happen so i dont spend too much time worrying about it so we have as a company matter gone through everything we do and how we do it and how we respond to negative rates so im not going through account by account but like i said a lot of these necessary services all the competitors its a competitive world so i agree with you if competitors dont do stuff we have a hard time doing it but i think youll see a lot of competitors respond to negative rates in a lot of different ways so there will be an opportunity to do something like that operator our next question is from jim mitchell of seaport global james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a question on deposit growth i think weve all been surprised at the continued growth can you just kind of talk to what youre seeing it looked like we had further growth in september are you expecting this to continue is it sort of moving out of money markets into deposits what do you think is driving the growth and do you expect to continue jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so theres no doubt that with the fed being this active that there is significant excess liquidity in the system we did think that we would see deposits normalize in the third quarter both on consumer spending on the consumer side and then on the wholesale side in places like securities services with asset managers holding cash on the sidelines we didnt see what we thought we would so yes we did continue to see deposit growth here in the third quarter going forward i think that normalization is still very much a part of our outlook except for that given that the normalization is a bit deferred here it will likely be offset by continued organic growth perhaps more than offset by continued organic growth james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right make sense and then maybe a follow up on credit i appreciate that were not going to see chargeoffs given where delinquencies are today but what do you think how do we think about delinquencies and what triggers you to either release or build reserves i would imagine well see it you would be making those decisions before chargeoffs where do we see delinquencies youve had a very good experience so far in your core book as well as the deferrals acting well when do we it just seems very surprising that we havent seen delinquencies tick up yet in any material way when do you expect that or is it really all dependent on sort of the good will of the government jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 well i think one of the reasons we havent seen delinquencies tick up is because of the payment relief but also the extraordinary support that has been provided through stimulus so well probably see delinquencies tick up in the early part of were not assuming further stimulus beyond the end of this year and how we think about reserves so we do think youll start to see delinquencies tick up early and then chargeoffs in the back half of i think future stimulus would give us more confidence in the economy delivering on the base case theres a lot of factors that well be looking at as we think about the right level of our reserves over the coming quarters and delinquencies will be just one part of that operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jennifer jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i may have missed this i had to jump off for a minute on the call but can you give us some color youve spoken very well about whats going on in the consumer credit area but when you go into the commercial side of the business can you share with us the sectors that youre seeing the biggest challenges and can you give us some color on the rerating process that youre going through on those credits that are troubled today and what kind of deterioration youre seeing in those specific credits in terms of possibly write downs or revaluations of if its collateral like on a commercial real estate loan jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so the sectors i think are ones that you would expect airlines lodging restaurants other te real estate oil and gas and those continue to be the sectors under the most pressure when you look at downgrades here in the third quarter or not here in the third quarter in the third quarter we saw downgrades slow a bit because in the second quarter we saw significant downgrades just on the increased level of debt that companies were taking on so we saw downgrades slow a bit in the third quarter but we do expect downgrades to continue particularly in real estate and then elsewhere in wholesale i would say ceo sentiment is guarded but constructive gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a follow up i know jamie touched on interest rates and how youre very focused in growing your business in any rate environment could you give us some color inflation if it does pick up and if we get a steepening in the curve obviously chairman powell has indicated hes not going to move on rates for quite some time but if we were looking in your third quarter of lets say and the 10year government bond yield is lets say basis points can you just give us some color i know thats not your prediction but what would that do for the margin and revenues if we were fortunate enough to see a steeper curve due to higher inflation jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co its a great question i dont have the sensitivity to hand go ahead jamie jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah id tell you theres a disclosure we make in the 10q that shows what would happen if rates go up basis points and i forgot the number jenn im going to say billion a year and with the long end is a piece of that but the smaller piece jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and that rolls in and compounds over time but thats not the right way to look at it you have to ask the why if you have an active environment rates are going up then you have more volume and more nii if you have stagflation by some chance thats a really bad idea so the why is more important than just the what here operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs saul your line is open please proceed saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hello sorry about that i was on mute i wanted to follow up on an earlier question i think it was from ken on partly on sales and trading but youre tracking this year in sales and trading to a revenue of close to billion and if we go back to say shortly after the crisis its been pretty consistently the annual revenues in say the billion to billion range there was obviously a lot of volatility on a quarterly basis but its generally been in that range so how do we think about or frame the range of outcomes as market conditions normalize do you feel like there have been changes in terms of either share or market structure that maybe allow you to have a larger revenue base and more revenues from those businesses than you have had historically even as market conditions normalize or is it just kind of too hard to tell im just trying to think through because it obviously has a pretty big impact on your overall ppnr and revenue forecast going forward jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so i think that as you know were on pace for a record year so i think any compares are going to be challenging and we do expect the market to continue to normalize and that could be partially offset by share gains as you mentioned but it is never a good idea to try to forecast markets even early in a quarter never mind the year before saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 great jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i dont know if jamie you want to add anything jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co this is the ground working weve got lots of tough competitors and were all building systems and stuff like that can do a better job for them almost impossible to forecast shortterm numbers in that saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah no and i understand that and i totally get that and appreciate that its just that youre kind of tracking to a revenue thats about higher than what youve done in any year in the postcrisis environment or similar to that effect so just that delta between the current run rate and with what has been a more normalized run rate is pretty sizable so im just trying to get any color in terms of kind of thinking through kind of a range of outcomes for where that could settle in and not necessarily in a given quarter per se but just more on a normalized basis you think about the business as a whole jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co first of all ill say our traders have done an exceptional job but i would say the second quarter will not be typical and the third quarter probably wont hopefully it might be better than its been the past couple of years but we dont know but remember the market itself total bonds total assets under management total credit products total mortgage products total global products thats growing over time so there is an underlying growth as spreads themselves move around and competition moves around operator our next question is from andrew lim of société générale andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so the first one youve got billion of reserves i guess thats in line with an extreme adverse scenario i know you cant tell whats going to happen going forward given many different variables but weve already seen some of that being released so i was wondering if we had the base case scenario pan out over the coming years how much of that billion should we expect to be released back to the pl and over what time period jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so ill start by saying were not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario so we are reserved for something worse than the base case because we had put heavy weights on scenarios that are worse than the base case but we are not reserved for the extreme adverse scenario and the release this quarter was first of all very small in the grand scheme of things and was almost exclusively related to portfolio runoff or exposure changes not anything to do with the change in our outlook and then if the economy delivers the base case you will see reserve releases from us in the coming quarters but it is very very difficult to try to tell you how much and when jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk surely youve got like you can make like an estimate of your reserves if you did assume the base case going forward my guess is its the difference between your jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co ive already said if the base case if the fed sic our base case happens were probably something like billion overreserved andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk billion overreserved or billion indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible no no billion overreserved andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk got it jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and i mentioned it earlier its just important to remember that there were capital modifications to cecl so only about half of that ends up in capital because as you release your reserves andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk yes of course jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk got it understood thanks for that and then just a followup question on your cet1 ratio you had a nice pickup there this quarter also youve had strong earnings but youve also had a near reduction in riskrated assets i was just wondering if you could give a bit more color on the moving parts there and how you expect that to pan out in the coming quarters jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 thats largely the rwa reduction was largely on revolver paydowns so i wouldnt expect that kind of pace to continue we will continue to build if were not allowed to buy back stock but we will continue to build capital on earnings so probably less so on rwa reduction operator our next question is from charles peabody of portales partners charles peabody q president portales partners llc yeah good morning a question about your rate sensitivity to the long end if i look at a time series going back to the second quarter of last year your rate sensitivity has increased every single quarter to a steepening yield curve in other words your nii would improve the more the yield curve steepens at the long end so my question is was that an intended action or residual effect because i did notice that youve been adding fairly significantly to your mbs portfolio jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so charles i dont know precisely the answer to that but its largely going to be im assuming on the growth in our deposit base which then has supported the growth in the securities portfolio charles peabody q president portales partners llc okay its substantial if you go back to the second quarter of last year you had a million potential increase in second quarter this year which was billion anyway my second question is related to the legacy impairment charge can you give us some color around that what sort of asset class that was in and is it over billion under billion jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so under billion of what remains and it was legacy investment that we took an impairment on and its not meaningful in the grand scheme of things operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thanks just a quick question to start with maybe as you think about kind of what youve been doing for customer accommodation as it relates to the pandemic i know it would have been fee waivers first quarter second quarter of this year but what kind of customer accommodation was happening in the third quarter was it kind of a clean number from a fees perspective in the third quarter or is there still a certain level of accommodation going on jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co there is probably i dont actually know jason and team can get you the details its less than what it was in the second quarter and its more what remains in terms of the reduction in fees is more a function of cash buffers jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2020 brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then is there a way that you can give an update on the ib pipeline but on a geographic basis as weve seen negative headlights sic headlines around covid kind of around the world is there different pipelines building in different regions thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co theres less of a regional story but from a product perspective overall were flattish to last year but ma is a little bit lower importantly though recovered quite nicely in the third quarter and ecm is a little bit higher but overall flattish operator and we have no further questions at this time jennifer a piepszak chief
