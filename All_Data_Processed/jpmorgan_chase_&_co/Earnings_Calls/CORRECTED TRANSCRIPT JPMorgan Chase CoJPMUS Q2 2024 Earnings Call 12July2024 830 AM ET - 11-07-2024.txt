management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases second quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation the presentation is available on jpmorgan chases website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back concerning forwardlooking statements please standby at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you and good morning everyone starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion with an rotce of these results included the billion net gain related to visa shares and the billion foundation contribution of the appreciated visa stock also included is million of net investment securities losses in corporate excluding these items the firm had net income of billion eps of and an rotce of touching on a couple of highlights in the cib ib fees were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter and markets revenue was up yearonyear in ccb we had a record number of firsttime investors and strong customer acquisition across checking accounts and card and weve continued to see strong net inflows across awm jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 now before i give more detail on the results i just want to mention that starting this quarter we are no longer explicitly calling out the first republic contribution in the presentation going forward well only specifically call it out if it is a meaningful driver in the yearonyear comparison as a reminder we acquired first republic in may of last year so the prioryear quarter only has two months of first republic results compared to the full three months this quarter also in the prioryear quarter most of the expenses were in corporate whereas now they are primarily in the relevant line of business now turning to page for the firmwide results the firm reported revenue of billion up billion or yearonyear excluding both the visa gain that i mentioned earlier as well as last years first republic bargain purchase gain of billion revenue of billion was up billion or nii ex markets was up million or driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates higher revolving balances in card and the additional month of first republicrelated nii partially offset by deposit margin compression and lower deposit balances nir ex markets was up billion or excluding the items i just mentioned it was up billion or largely driven by higher investment banking revenue and asset management fees both periods included net investment securities losses and markets revenue was up million or yearonyear expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear excluding the foundation contribution i previously mentioned expenses were up primarily driven by compensation including revenuerelated compensation and growth in employees and credit costs were billion reflecting net chargeoffs of billion and a net reserve build of million net chargeoffs were up million yearonyear predominantly driven by card the net reserve build included million in consumer and million in wholesale on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up basis points versus the prior quarter primarily driven by net income largely offset by capital distributions and higher rwa as you know we completed ccar a couple of weeks ago and have already disclosed a number of the key points let me summarize them again here our preliminary scb is although the final scb could be higher the preliminary scb which is up from the current requirement of results in a standardized cet1 ratio requirement which goes into effect in the fourth quarter of and finally the firm announced that the board intends to increase the quarterly common stock dividend from to per share in the third quarter of now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear in banking wealth management revenue was down year onyear reflecting lower deposits and deposit margin compression partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue average deposits were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter client investment assets were up yearonyear predominantly driven by market performance in home lending revenue of billion was up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher nii including one additional month of the first republic portfolio turning to card services auto revenue was up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher card nii on higher revolving balances card outstandings were up due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were billion down coming off strong originations from a year ago while continuing to maintain healthy margins expenses of billion were up yearon year predominantly driven by first republic expenses now reflected in the lines of business as i mentioned earlier as well as field compensation and continued growth in technology and marketing jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion reflecting net chargeoffs of billion up million yearonyear predominantly driven by card as newer vintages season and credit normalization continues the net reserve build was million also driven by card due to loan growth and updates to certain macroeconomic variables next the commercial investment bank on page our new commercial investment bank reported net income of billion on revenue of billion youll note that we are disclosing revenue by business as well as breaking down the banking payments revenue by client coverage segment in order to best highlight the relevant trends in both important dimensions of the wholesale franchise this quarter ib fees were up year onyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were up primarily driven by the closing of a few large deals and a weak prioryear quarter underwriting fees were up meaningfully with equity up and debt up benefiting from favorable market conditions in terms of the outlook were pleased with both the yearonyear and sequential improvement in the quarter we remain cautiously optimistic about the pipeline although many of the same headwinds are still in effect its also worth noting that pullforward refinancing activity was a meaningful contributor to the strong performance in the first half of the year payments revenue was billion down yearonyear as deposit margin compression and higher deposit related client credits were largely offset by fee growth moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear fixed income was up with continued strength in securitized products and equity markets was up with equity derivatives up on improved client activity and we saw record revenue in prime and growth in client balances amid supportive equity market levels securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher volumes and market levels largely offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by higher revenuerelated compensation legal expense and volumerelated noncompensation expense in banking payments average loans were up yearonyear due to the impact of the first republic acquisition and flat sequentially demand for new loans remains muted as middle market and large corporate clients remain somewhat cautious due to the economic environment and revolver utilization continues to be below prepandemic levels also capital markets are open and are providing an alternative to traditional bank lending for these clients in cre higher rates continue to suppress both loan origination and payoff activity average client deposits were up yearonyear and relatively flat sequentially finally credit costs were million the net reserve build of million was primarily driven by incorporating the first republic portfolio in the firms modeled approach net chargeoffs were million of which about half was in office then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows as well as higher brokerage activity largely offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation primarily revenuerelated compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams for the quarter longterm net inflows were billion led by equities and fixed income and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion aum of trillion was up yearonyear and client assets of jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 trillion were up yearonyear driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows and finally loans and deposits were both flat quarteronquarter turning to corporate on page corporate reported net income of billion on revenue of billion excluding this quarters visarelated gain and the first republic bargain purchase gain in the prior year nir was up approximately million yearonyear nii was up million yearonyear driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and higher rates expenses of billion were up million yearonyear excluding foundation contribution expenses were down million yearonyear largely as a result of moving first republicrelated expense out of corporate into the relevant segments to finish up we have the outlook on page our guidance including the drivers remains unchanged from what we said at investor day we continue to expect nii and nii ex markets of approximately billion adjusted expense of about billion and on credit card net chargeoff rate of approximately so to wrap up the reported performance for the quarter was exceptional and actually represents record revenue and net income or more importantly after excluding the significant items the underlying performance continues to be quite strong and as always we remain focused on continuing to execute with discipline and with that lets open the line for qa question and answer section operator please stand by for our first question well go to the line of steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question on capital just given some indications that the fed is considering favorable revisions to both basel iii endgame and the gsib surcharge calculations which i know youve been pushing for some time as you evaluate just different capital scenarios are these revisions material enough where they could support a higher normalized rotce at the firm versus the target and if so just how that might impact or inform your appetite for buybacks going forward jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right okay thanks steve and actually before answering the question i just want to remind everyone that jamie is not able to join because he has a travel conflict overseas so its just going to be me today jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 okay good question on the capital and the rotce so let me start with the rotce point first in short my answer to that question would be no its hard to imagine a scenario coming out of the whole potential range of outcomes on capital that involves an upward revision on rotce if you think about the way weve been talking about this weve said that before the basel iii endgame proposal we had a through the cycle target and that while you can imagine a range of different outcomes the vast majority of them involve expansions of the denominator and while we had ideas about changing the perimeter and repricing all of which are still sort of in effect most of those would be thought of as mitigants rather than things that would actually like increase the rotce and i dont really think that answer has particularly changed so as of now thats what i would say which is a good pivot to the next point which is yeah weve been reading the same press coverage youve been reading and its fun and interesting to speculate about the potential outcomes here but in reality we dont know anything you dont know we dont know how reliable the press coverage is and so in that sense i feel like on the overall capital return and buyback trajectory not much has actually changed relative to what i laid out at investor day the comments that i made then the comments that jamie made then as well as the comments that jamie made subsequent week at an industry conference so maybe ill just briefly summarize for everyones benefit what we think that is which is one we do recognize that our current practice on capital return and buybacks does lead to an everexpanding cet1 ratio but obviously were going to run the company over the cycle over time at a reasonable cet1 ratio with reasonable buffers relative to our requirement so after all the uncertainty is sorted out the question of the deployment of the capital one way or another is a matter of when not if on the capital hierarchy its also worth noting thats another thing that remains unchanged so ill review it quickly growing the business organically and inorganically sustainable dividend and in that context its worth noting that the boards announced intention to increase it to is a increase prior to last year so thats a testament to our performance and that is a return of capital and then finally buybacks but that hierarchy does not commit us to return of the capital generation in any given quarter and so as we sit here today when you look at the relationship between the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital and the opportunities to deploy the capital outside the firm its kind of hard to imagine an environment where that relationship argues more strongly for patience so given all that putting it all together and sorry for the long answer we remain comfortable with the current amount of excess capital and as jamie has said we really continue to think about it as earnings in store as much as anything else steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no need to apologize jeremy that was a really helpful perspective maybe just for my followup on nii youve been very consistent just in flagging the risk related to nii overearning especially in light of potential deposit attrition as well as repricing headwinds in the second quarter we did see at least some moderation in repricing pressures deposit balances were also more resilient in with a seasonally weak quarter for deposit growth so just given the evidence that some deposit pressures appear to be abating do you see the potential for nii normalizing higher and where do you think that level could ultimately be in terms of stabilization jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah interesting question steve so lets talk about deposit balances so yeah i see your point about how balance pressures are slightly abating when you look at the system as a whole just to go through it qt is still a jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 bit of a headwind loan growth is modest and not enough to offset that and our pe seems to have settled in roughly at its current levels and there are reasons to believe that it might not go down that much more although that could always change and that could supply extra reserves into the system but on balance net across all those various effects we still think that there are net headwinds to deposit balances so when we think of our balance outlook we see it as flat to slightly down maybe with our sort of market share and growth ambitions offsetting those systemwide headwinds so in terms of normalizing higher i guess it depends on relative to what but i think its definitely too early to be sort of calling the end of the overearning narrative or the normalization narrative clearly the main difference in our current guidance relative to what we had earlier in the year which implied a lot more sequential decline is just the change in the fed outlook so two cuts versus six cuts is the main difference there but obviously based on the latest inflation data and so on you could easily get back to a situation with a lot more cuts in the yield curve so well see how it goes and in the end were kind of focused on on just running the place recognizing and trying not to be distracted by what remains some amount of overearning whatever it is steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood jeremy thanks so much for taking my questions jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks steve operator next well go to the line of saul martinez from hsbc please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question jeremy can you give an update on the stress capital buffer you noted obviously that you think there is an error in the feds calculation due to oci can you just give us a sense of what the dialogue with the fed looks like is there a process to modify the scb higher and if you could give us a sense of what that process looks like jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so im not going to comment about any conversations with the fed not to confirm or deny that they even exist that stuff is private and so then if you talk about like the timing here right so you know that the stress capital buffer thats been released at is a preliminary number by rule the fed has to release that by august it may come sooner you talked about an error in the calculation we havent used that word what we know what we believe rather is that the amount of oci gain that came through the feds disclosed results looked non intuitively high to us and if you adjust that in ways that we think are reasonable you would get a slightly higher stress capital buffer whether the fed agrees and whether they decide to make that change or not is up to them and well see what happens i think the larger point is that if you look at the industry as a whole and if you sort of put us into that with some higher pro formad scb whatever it might suitably be you actually see once again quite a bit of volatility in the yearonyear change in the stress capital buffer for many firms and just sort of reiterating and another example of what weve said a lot over the years that its volatile its untransparent it makes it very hard to manage capital of jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 a bank it leads to excessively high management buffers and we think its really not a great way to do things so ill leave it at that saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay got it thats helpful just following up on capital returns on steves question i think you highlighted in response its a matter of when not if and obviously jamies not there you cant speak for jamie but seems to have shown limited enthusiasm for a special dividend or buybacks at current valuations can you just give us a sense of how youre thinking about the various options any updated thoughts on a special dividend and can you do other things like for example have a material increase in your dividend payout sort of a step function increase where keep that flat and grow into that grow your earnings into that over time can you just maybe give us a sense of how youre thinking about what options you have available to deploy that capital jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure yeah i mean i would direct you to read im sure you have jamies comments at the industry conference where he participated the week after investor day because he went into just good amount of detail on this stuff addressing some of these points and i think this comment there about the special dividend was that its not really our preference we hear from people that many of our investors wouldnt find that particularly appealing and he said as much that it wouldnt be sort of our first choice so i think the larger point is just that a little bit to your question there are a number of tools in the toolkit and theyre really the same tools that are part of our capital hierarchy so first and foremost were looking to deploy the capital into organic or inorganic growth and then the dividend i think were always going to want to keep it in that sort of like sustainable and also sustainable in a stressed environment so that continues to be the way we think about that and then at the end of it its buybacks and jamies been on the record for over a decade i think over many shareholder letters talking about how he thinks about price and buybacks and valuation and price is a factor so thats sort of the totality of the set of options i guess saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay great thanks a lot jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks saul operator next well go to the line of ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks a lot good morning jeremy jeremy great to see the progress on investment banking fees up sequentially and yearoveryear and i saw you on the tape earlier just talking about still regulatory concerns a little bit in the advisory space and we clearly didnt see the debt pullforward play through because your dcm was great again im just wondering just where you feel the environment is relative to the potential and just where jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 the dialogue is across the three main bucket areas in terms of like how does this feel in terms of a current environment versus a potential environment that we could still see ahead thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks ken its progress right i mean were happy to see the progress people have been talking about depressed banking fee wallet for some time and its nice to see not only the yearonyear pop from a low base but also a nice sequential improvement so thats the first thing to say in terms of dialogue and engagement its definitely elevated so the dialogue on ecm is elevated and the dialogue on ma is quite robust as well so all of those are good things that encourage us and make us hopeful that we could be seeing sort of a better trend in this space but there are some important caveats so on the dcm side yeah we made pullforward comments in the first quarter but we still feel that this second quarter still reflects a bunch of pullforward and therefore were reasonably cautious about the second half of the year importantly a lot of the activity is refinancing activity as opposed to for example acquisition finance so the fact that ma remains still relatively muted in terms of actual deals has knockon effects on dcm as well and when a higher percentage of the wallet is refied then the pullforward risk becomes a little bit higher on ecm if you look at it kind of at a remove you might ask the question given the performance of the overall indices you would think it would be a really booming environment for ipos for example and while its improving its not quite as good as you would otherwise expect and thats driven by a variety of factors including the fact that as has been widely discussed the extent to which the performance of the large indices is driven by like a few stocks the sort of midcap tech growth space and other spaces that would typically be driving ipos have had much more muted performance also a lot of the private capital that was raised a couple of years ago was raised at pretty high valuations and so in some cases people looking at ipos could be looking at down rounds thats an issue and while secondary market performance of ipos has improved meaningfully in some cases people still have concerns about that so those are a little bit of overhang on that space i think we can hope that over time that fades away and the trend gets a bit more robust and yeah on the advisory side the regulatory overhang is there remains there and so well just have to see how that plays out ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thank you for all that jeremy and just one on the consumer side just anything youre noticing in terms of people just have been waiting for this delinquency stabilization on the credit card side obviously your loss rates are coming in as you expected and we did see days pretty flat and days come down a little bit and is that seasonal or is it just a good rate of change trend any thoughts there thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i still feel like when it comes to card chargeoffs and delinquencies theres just not much to see there its normalization not deterioration its in line with expectations as i say we always look quite closely inside the cohort inside the income cohorts and when you look in there specifically for example on spend patterns you can see a little bit of evidence of behavior thats consistent with a little bit of weakness in the lowerincome segments where you see a little bit of rotation on the spend out of discretionary into nondiscretionary jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 but the effects are really quite subtle and in my mind definitely entirely consistent with the type of economic environment that were seeing which while very strong and certainly a lot stronger than anyone would have thought given the tightness of monetary conditions say like theyve been predicting it a couple of years ago or whatever you are seeing slightly higher unemployment you are seeing moderating gdp growth and so its not entirely surprising that youre seeing a tiny bit of weakness in some pockets of spend so it all kind of hangs together in what is in some sense actually not a very interesting story ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks ken operator next well go to the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so jeremy the discussions so far around private credit and you all your recent comments have been the ability to add on balance sheet and compete when you need to compete on the private credit front and i do think that most of the discussion has been about the direct lending component so im curious if youre showing more progress and activity on that front and then very importantly do you see the same trend happening on the assetbacked finance side because thats a bigger part of the world and its a bigger part of your business so id appreciate your thoughts there thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks glenn so on private credit so nothing really new to say there i think i guess one way the environments evolving a little bit is as you know a lot of money has been raised in private credit funds looking for deals and sort of a little bit to my prior comment in a relatively muted acquisition finance environment at this point youve got a lot of money chasing like not that many deals so the space is a little bit quieter than it was at the margin another interesting thing to note is some of this discussion about kind of lender protections that were typical in the syndicated leveraged finance market making their way into the private market as well as sort of people realize that even in the private market you probably need some of those protections in some cases which is sort of supportive of the theme that weve been talking about about convergence between the direct lending space and the syndicated lending space which is kind of our core thesis here which is that we can offer bestinclass service across the entire continuum including secondary market trading and so on so we feel optimistic about our offering there i think the current environment is maybe a little bit quieter than it was so its maybe not a great moment to like kind of test whether were doing a lot more or less in the space so to speak and then on assetbacked financing you actually asked me that question before and at the time my answer was that i hadnt heard much about that trend and that continues to be the case but clearly there must be something im missing so i can follow up on that and maybe we can have a chat about it jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi no thats great for you if youre not hearing much about it so we can leave it at that maybe just one quick followup in terms of your just overall posturing you were patient and smart when rates were low waited to deploy worked out great we know that story now it seems like you have tons of excess liquidity and youre being patient and rates are high and im curious on how you think about what kind of triggers what kind of things youre looking for in the market to know if and when you would extend duration jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right i mean on duration in truth we have actually added a little bit of duration over the last couple of quarters so thats one thing to say that was more last quarter than this quarter but i guess i would just caution you from a little bit away from looking at kind of our reported cash balances and our balance sheet and concluding that when you look at the duration concept holistically that there is a lot to be done differently on the duration front so clearly its true that empirically we behaved like very assetsensitively in this rate hiking cycle and that has resulted in a lot of excess nii generation sort of on the way up in the near term but when we look at the firms overall sensitivity to rates we look at it through both like the eartype lens a shortterm nii sensitivity but also a variety of other lenses including various types of scenario analysis including impacts on capital and higher rates and as i think jamie has said a couple times we actually aim to be relatively balanced on that front also given like the inverted yield curve its not as if extending duration from these levels means that youre locking in rates in fact the forwards are not sort of that compelling given our views about some sort of structural upward pressures on inflation and so on so i think when you put that all together i dont think that kind of a big change in duration posture is a thing thats front of line for us glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi super helpful thanks so much for that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks glenn operator next well go to the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was just wondering if you can elaborate on essentially the math behind the rotce being too high at and more normalized at obviously youve pointed to overearning on nii and i guess the question is is that all of it to go from to and if so is that all consumer deposit costs or are there a few other components that you could help frame for us jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure good question matt i mean i guess the way i think about it is a couple of things like our returns tend to be a bit seasonal right so if you kind of build yourself out a fullyear forecast and make reasonable just based jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 on your own or analyst consensus or whatever and you think about fourth quarter like better look at this on a full year basis when you think about the returns than the quarterly numbers and you obviously have to strip out kind of the onetime items and so if you do that like whatever you get for this year is still clearly a number thats higher than the so yeah one source of headwinds is normalization of the nii primarily as a result of expected higher deposit costs thats weve talked about that part of it is also the yield curve effects some cuts will come into the curve at some point and in the normal course if you kind of do a very very very simple mental model of the company you would have like revenues growing at some organic gdp like rate maybe higher and expenses growing at a similar slightly lower rate producing a sort of relatively stable overhead ratio but even if the amount of nii normalization winds up being less than we might have thought at some prior point you still have some background you still have some normalization of the overhead ratio that needs to happen so as much as our discipline on expense management is as tight as it always has been there inflation is still nonzero there are still investments that were executing theres still higher expense to come in a slightly flatter revenue environment as a result of in part the normalization of nii and then the final point is that whatever winds up being the answer on basel iii endgame and all the other pieces you have to assume some amount of expansion of the denominator at least based on what we know so far so of course any of those pieces could be wrong but thats kind of how we get to our and if you look at the various scenarios that we showed on the last page of my investor day presentation it illustrates those dynamics and also how much the range could actually vary as a function of the economic environment and other factors matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah that was a really helpful chart just the one followup on the yield curve effects i guess what do you mean by that because right now the yield curve is inverted maybe youre still breathing in the impact of that but kind of longer term youd expect little bit of steepness of the curve which i would think would help but what did you mean by that thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean you and i have talked about this before i guess i sort of i guess i dont really agree fundamentally with the notion that the way to think about things is that sort of yield curve steepness above and beyond whats priced in by the forewords is a source of structural nii or nim for banks if you know what i mean like i mean people have different views about the socalled term premium and obviously in a moment of inverted curve and different types of treasury supply dynamics peoples thinking on that may be changing but i think we saw when rates were at zero and the 10year note was below everyone sort of many people were kind of tempted to try to get extra nim extra nii by extending duration a lot but when the steepness of the curve implies it is driven by the expectation of actually aggressive fed tightening its just a timing issue and you can wind up kind of pretty offsides from a capital and other perspectives so therere some interesting questions about whether fiscal dynamics might result in a structurally steeper yield curve down the road and whether that could be sort of earning the term premium so to speak could be a source of nii but that feels a bit speculative to me at this point jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thank you for the details jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks matt operator next well go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi jeremy you said its too early to end the overearning narrative and you highlighted higher deposit costs and the impact of lower rates and lower nii and dcm pullforward and credit costs going higher anything im missing in that list and what would cause you to end the overearning narrative jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co no actually i think that is the right list mike i mean frankly i think one thing that would end the overearning narrative is if our annual returns were closer to i mean to the extent that that is the through the cycle number that we believe and that were currently producing more than that thats one very simple way to look at that but the pieces of that are the pieces that you talked about and the single most important piece is the deposit margin our deposit margins are well above historical norms and that is a big part of the reason that we still are emphasizing the overearning narrative mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc your through the cycle rotce expectation what is the cet1 ratio that you assume for that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i mean we would generally assume requirements plus a reasonable buffer which depending on the shape of rules could be a little bit smaller or a little bit bigger and no small part is a function of the volatility of those rules which goes back to my prior comments on scb and ccar but obviously as you well know what actually matters is less the ratio and more the dollars and at this point the dollars are very much a function of where rules land and where the rwa lands and obviously things like gsib recalibration and so on so weve done a bunch of scenario analysis along the lines of what i did at investor day that informs those numbers but that is obviously one big element of uncertainty behind that which is why at investor day when we talked about it both daniel and i were quite specific about saying that we thought was still achievable assuming a reasonable outcome on the basel iii endgame mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc let me just zoom out for one more question on the return target i mean when i asked jamie at the investor day would it make sense to have capital he was basically telling me to take a hike right and now you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 have capital and youre saying well we might want to have a lot more capital here i mean at some point if youre spending billion a year to improve the company if youre gaining share with digital banking if youre automating the back office if youre moving ahead with ai if youre doing all these things that i think you say others arent doing why wouldnt those returns go higher over time or do you just assume youll be competing those benefits away thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think in short mike and weve talked about this a lot and jamies talked about this a lot its a very very very competitive market and were very happy with our performance were very happy with the share weve taken and is like an amazing number actually and like to be able to do that given how robust the competition is from banks from nonbanks from us banks from foreign banks and all of the different businesses that we compete in is something that were really proud of so the number has a range around it obviously so its not a promise its not a guarantee and it can fluctuate but were very proud to be in the ballpark of being able to think that we can deliver it again assuming a reasonable outcome on basel iii endgame but its a very very very competitive market across all of our products and services and regions and client segments mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator next well go to the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi jeremy hi jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i did want to ask one drilldown question on and its related to the dollar amount of buybacks that you did do i think in the press release right in the slide deck its billion common stock net repurchases so the question here is whats the governor for you on how much to do every quarter and i mean i understand its a function of okay how much do we organically grow but even with that so you get the organic growth which you had some nice movement there but you do the organic growth and then is it how much do we earn and we want to buy back our earnings or how should we be thinking about what that repurchase volume should be looking like over time and i remember over at investor day the whole debate around i dont want to buy back my stock but we are right so i get this question from investors quite a bit of how should we be thinking about how you think about what the right amount is to be doing here jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 yeah thats a very good and fair question betsy so let me try to unpack it to the best of my ability so in no particular order one thing that weve really tried to emphasize in a number of different settings including in our recent 10qs actually is that we dont want to get into the business of guiding on buybacks so were going to buy back whatever we think makes sense in the current moment sort of and we reserve the right to sort of change that at any time so i recognize that not everyone loves that but that is kind of a philosophical belief and so i might as well say it explicitly it was pretty clear in the q also but im just going to say that again so thats point one but having said that let me nonetheless try to address your point on framework and governors so generally speaking we think it doesnt make sense to sort of exit the market entirely unless the conditions are much more unusual than they are right now lets say obviously when for whatever reason if we ever need to build capital in a hurry weve done it before and were always comfortable suspending buybacks entirely but i think some modest amount of buybacks is a reasonable thing to do when youre generating your kind of capital and so we were talking before about this billion pace were kind of trying to move away from this notion of a pace but thats where that idea comes from lets put it that way you talked about the billion which i recognize may seem like a little bit of a random number but where that actually comes from is the other statement that we made that we have these significant item gains from visa and if you think about what that means it means that we have post the acceptance of the exchange offer a meaningful long position and a liquid largecap financial stock ie visa which realistically is highly correlated to our own stock and so in some sense why carry that instead of just buying back jpmorgan stock so we talked about jamie talked about as we liquidate the visa deploying those proceeds into jpm and thats what we did this quarter so that is why the billion is a little higher and its consistent with my comments at investor day around having slightly increased the amount of buybacks and beyond that what youre left with is my answer to steves question which is that to your point about buying back earnings or whatever when were generating these types of earnings and theres this much organic capital being generated in the absence of opportunities to deploy it organically or inorganically and while continuing to maintain our healthy but sustainable dividend if we dont return the capital we are going to keep growing the cet1 ratio to levels which if you think about the long strategic outlook of the company are not reasonable theyre just artificially high and unnecessary so one way or the other that will need to be addressed at some point its just that we dont feel that now is the right time betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you jeremy appreciate it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks betsy operator next well go to the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jeremy how are you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jeremy i know you touched on deposits earlier in the call in response to a question i noticed on the average balances the noninterestbearing deposits were relatively stable quartertoquarter versus prior quarters when theyve steadily declined and this is one of the areas of course investors are focused on in terms of the future of the net interest margin for you and your peers can you elaborate if you can what youre seeing in that noninterestbearing deposit account i know this is average and not period and the end number may actually be lower but what are you guys seeing here jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question gerard i have to be honest i hadnt focused on that particular sequential explain ie quarteronquarter change and average noninterestbearing deposits but i think the more important question is the big picture question which is what do we expect how are we thinking about ongoing migration of noninterestbearing into interestbearing in the current environment and how that affects our nii outlook and our expectation for weighted average rate paid on deposits and the answer to that question is that we do continue to expect that migration to happen so if you think about it in the wholesale space you have a bunch of clients with some balances and noninterestbearing accounts and over time for a variety of reasons we do see them moving those balances into interestbearing so we do continue to expect that migration to happen and therefore that will be a source of headwinds and that migration sometimes happens internally ie out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing or into cds sometimes it goes into money markets or into investments which is what we see happening in our wealth management business and some of it does leave the company but one of the things that were encouraged by is the extent to which we are actually capturing a large portion of that yieldseeking flow through cds and money market offerings et cetera across our various franchises so big picture i do think that migration out of noninterest bearing into interestbearing will continue to be a thing and that is a contributor to the modest headwinds that we expect for nii right now but yeah ill leave it at that i guess gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and as a followup youve been very clear about the consumer credit card chargeoffs and delinquency levels and we all know about the commercial real estate office and you always talk about overearning on net interest income of course one of the great credit quality stories for everyone including yourselves is the ci portfolio how strong its been in this elevated rate environment and i know your numbers are still quite low but in the corporate and investment bank you had about a million pickup in nonaccrual loans can you share with us what are you seeing in ci are there any early signs of cracks or anything and again i know your numbers are still good but im just trying to look forward to see if theres something here over the next months or so jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 yeah its a good question i think the short answer is no were not really seeing early signs of cracks in ci i mean yes i agree with you like the ci chargeoff rate has been very very low for a long time i think we emphasized that at last years investor day if i remember correctly i think the ci chargeoff rate weve seen in years was something like literally zero so that is clearly very low by historical standards and while we take a lot of pride in that number and i think it reflects the discipline in our underwriting process and the strength of our credit culture across the bankers and the risk team thats not we dont actually run that franchise to like a zero loss expectation so you have to assume there will be some upward pressure on that but in any given quarter the ci numbers tend to be quite lumpy and quite idiosyncratic so i dont think that anything in the current quarters results is indicative of anything broader and i havent heard anyone internally talk that way i would say gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate the insights as always thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks gerard operator next well go to the line of erika najarian from ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning i just had one cleanup question jeremy the consensus provision for is billion could you maybe clarify for once and for all sort of jamies comments at an industry conference earlier and try to sort of triangulate if that billion provision is appropriate for the growth level that you are planning for in card jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah happy to clarify that so jamies comments were that the allowance the build and the card allowance so were talking about card specifically we expected something like billion for the full year as i sit here today our expectation for that number is actually slightly higher but its in the ballpark and i think in terms of what that means for the consensus on the overall allowance change for the year last time i checked it still looked a little low on that front so who knows what itll actually wind up being but that remains our view one question that weve gotten is how to reconcile that build to the growth in os that weve talked about because it seems like a little bit high relative to what you would have otherwise assumed if you apply some sort of a standard coverage ratio to that growth but the reason thats the case is essentially a combination of higher revolving mix as we continue to see some normalization revolve in that as well as seasoning of earlier vintages which comes with slightly higher allowance per unit of os growth erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks erika operator and for our final question well go to the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc oh hey good morning maybe just one last question on sort of deploying excess capital it seems like the two primary ways to do that organically would be through the trading book or the loan book so maybe two questions there one trading assets were up yearoveryear is that you leaning into it or just a function of demand and is there further opportunities to grow that and then secondly outside of card loan demand has been quite weak and any thoughts from you on if youre seeing any change in demand or how youre thinking about loan demand going forward thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks jim good questions so yeah trading assets have been up that is basically client activity primarily secured financingrelated sort of matchbook repotype stuff and similar things that are gross up the balance sheet quite a bit but are quite low risk and therefore quite low rwa intensity so while our ability to supply that financing to clients is something that were happy about and its very much represents us leaning into the franchise to serve our clients its not really particularly rwa and therefore capital intensive and therefore doesnt really reflect an aggressive choice on our part to deploy capital so to speak on the loan demand front yeah i mean unfortunately i just dont have much new to say there on loan demand meaning to your point loan demand remains quite muted everywhere except card our card business is of course in no way capital constrained so whatever growth makes sense there in terms of our customer franchise and our ability to acquire accounts and retain accounts and what fits inside our credit risk appetite is growth thats going to make sense and so were very happy to deploy capital to that but its not constrained by our willingness or ability to deploy capital to that and of course for the rest of the loan space the last thing that were going to do is have the excess capital meaning that we lean into lending that is not inside our risk appetite or inside our credit box especially in a world where spreads are quite compressed and terms are under pressure so theres always a balance between capital deployment and assessing economic risk rationally and frankly that is in some sense a microcosm of the larger challenge that we have right now when i talked about if there was ever a moment where the opportunity cost of not deploying the capital relative to how attractive the opportunities outside the walls of the company are now would be it in terms of being patient thats a little bit one example of what i was referring to jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right okay great thanks jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 12jul2024 jeremy barnum a
