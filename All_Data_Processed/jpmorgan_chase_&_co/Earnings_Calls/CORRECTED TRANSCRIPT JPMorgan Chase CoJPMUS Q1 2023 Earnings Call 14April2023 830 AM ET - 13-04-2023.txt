management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases first quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks and good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer on the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of these results included million of net investment securities losses in corporate before reviewing our results for the quarter lets talk about the recent bank failures jamie has addressed a number of the important themes in his shareholder letter and a recent televised interview so i will go straight to the specific impacts on the firm as you would expect we saw significant new account opening activity and meaningful deposit and money market fund inflows most significantly in the commercial bank business banking and awm regarding the deposit inflows at the firmwide level average deposits were down quarteronquarter while endofperiod deposits were up quarteronquarter implying an intraquarter reversal of the recent outflow trend as a consequence of the march events we estimate that we have retained approximately billion of these deposit inflows at quarterend its important to note that while the sequential periodend deposit increase is higher than we would have otherwise expected our current full year nii outlook which i will address at the end still assumes modest deposit outflows from here we expect these outflows to be driven by the same factors as last quarter as well as the expectation that we will not retain all of this quarters inflows now back to the quarter touching on a few highlights we grew our ib fee wallet share consumer spending remains solid with combined debit and credit card spend up yearonyear and credit continues to normalize but actual performance remains strong across the company on page we have some more detail revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear nii ex markets was up billion or driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances nir ex markets was down billion or driven by the securities losses previously mentioned as well as lower ib fees and lower auto lease income on lower volume and markets revenue was down million or yearon year jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 expenses of billion were up million or yearonyear driven by compensationrelated costs reflecting the annualization of last years head count growth and wage inflation these results include the impact of the higher fdic assessment i mentioned last quarter which of course is unrelated to recent events and credit costs of billion included net chargeoffs of billion predominantly in card the net reserve build of billion was largely driven by deterioration in our weightedaverage economic outlook on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up about basis points which was primarily driven by the benefit of net income less distributions and aoci gains and in line with what we previously said we resumed stock buybacks this quarter and distributed a total of billion in net repurchases back to shareholders now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page touching quickly on the health of us consumers and small businesses based on our data both continue to show resilience and remain on the path to normalization as expected but we continue to monitor their activity closely spend remains solid and we have not observed any notable pullback throughout the quarter moving to financial results ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear in banking and wealth management revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates average deposits were down quarteronquarter in line with recent trends throughout the quarter we continued to see customer flows to higher yielding products as you would expect but were encouraged by what we are capturing in cds and our wealth management offerings client investment assets were down yearonyear but up quarteronquarter driven by market performance as well as strong net inflows in home lending revenue was down yearonyear largely driven by lower net interest income from tighter loan spreads and lower production revenue moving to card services and auto revenue was up yearonyear largely driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income credit card spend was up year onyear card outstandings were up driven by strong new account growth and revolve normalization and in auto originations were billion up yearonyear expenses of billion were up yearonyear reflecting the impact of wage inflation and higher head count in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion reflecting reserve builds of million in card and million in home lending net chargeoffs were billion up about million yearonyear in line with expectations as delinquency levels continue to normalize across portfolios next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was down yearonyear ib fees were down we ranked number one with first quarter wallet share of in advisory fees were down compared to a strong first quarter last year our underwriting businesses continued to be affected by market conditions with fees down for debt and for equity in terms of the outlook the dynamics remain the same our pipeline is relatively robust but conversion is sensitive to market conditions and the economic outlook we expect the second quarter and the rest of the year to remain challenging moving to markets total revenue was billion down yearonyear fixed income was flat rates was strong during the rally early in the quarter as well as through the elevated volatility in march credit was up on the back of higher client flows and currencies emerging markets was down relative to a very strong first quarter in jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 the prior year equity markets was down driven by lower revenues in derivatives relative to a strong first quarter in the prior year and lower client activity in cash payments revenue was billion up yearonyear excluding the net impact of equity investments primarily a gain in the prior year it was up with the growth driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances and market levels expenses of billion were up yearonyear as higher head count and wage inflation were largely offset by lower revenuerelated compensation moving to the commercial bank on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins payments revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher rates and gross investment banking revenue of million was up yearonyear on increased ma and bond underwriting from large deal activity expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by higher compensation expense including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense average deposits were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter predominantly driven by continued attrition in nonoperating deposits as well as seasonally lower balances loans were up yearonyear and sequentially ci loans were up quarteronquarter with somewhat different dynamics based on client size in middle market banking higher rates and recession concerns have decreased new loan demand and utilization which is also leading to weakness in capex spending in corporate client banking utilization rates increased modestly quarteronquarter as capital market conditions led more clients to opt for bank debt cre loans were also up sequentially with higher rates creating headwinds from both originations and prepayments and given the recent focus on commercial real estate let me remind you that our office sector exposure is less than of our portfolio and is focused in urban dense markets and nearly twothirds of our loans are multifamily primarily in supply constrained markets finally credit costs of million included a net reserve build of million predominantly driven by what i mentioned upfront then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and a valuation gain on our initial investment triggered by taking full ownership of our asset management joint venture in china partially offset by the impact of lower average market levels on management fees and lower performance fees expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by compensation reflecting growth in our private banking advisor teams higher revenuerelated compensation and the runrate impact of acquisitions for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion led by fixed income and equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion inclusive of our ongoing deposit migration aum of trillion was up yearonyear and overall client assets of trillion were up driven by continued net inflows into liquidity and longterm products and finally loans were down quarteronquarter driven by lower securitiesbased lending while average deposits were down turning to corporate on page corporate reported net income of million revenue was million compared to a net loss of million last year nii was billion up billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates nir was a loss of million compared with a loss of million in the prior year and jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 included the net investment securities losses i mentioned earlier expenses of million were down million yearonyear and credit costs of million were driven by reserve builds on a couple of single name exposures next the outlook on page we now expect nii and nii ex markets to be approximately billion this increase in guidance is primarily driven by lower rate paid assumptions across both consumer and wholesale in light of the expectation of fed cuts later in the year as well as slightly higher card revolving balances note that in line with my comments at the outset recent deposit balance increases are not a meaningful contributor to the upward revision in the nii outlook given that we expect a meaningful portion of the recent inflows to reverse later in the year i would point out that this outlook still embeds significant reprice lags we think a more sustainable nii ex markets runrate in the mediumterm is well below this quarters billion as well as below the billion that is implied for the rest of the year by our full year guidance and while we dont know exactly when this lower run rate will be reached when it happens we believe it will be around the mid and of course as we mentioned last quarter this nii outlook remains highly sensitive to the uncertainty associated with the timing and the extent of deposit reprice investment portfolio decisions the dynamics of qt and rrp the trajectory of fed funds as well as the broader macroeconomic environment including its impact on loan growth separately its worth noting that markets nii may start to trend slightly positive towards the end of the year as a function of mix and rate effects moving to expenses our outlook for continues to be about billion importantly this does not currently include the impact of the pending fdic special assessment and on credit we continue to expect the card net chargeoff rate to be approximately so to wrap up our strong results this quarter once again highlight the earnings power of this diversified franchise we have benefited from our fortress principles and commitment to invest which we will continue to do as we head into an increasingly uncertain environment with that operator please open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 question and answer section operator please stand by the first question is coming from the line of steve chubak with wolfe research now open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so jamie i was actually hoping to get your perspective on how you see the recent developments with svb impacting the regulatory landscape for the big banks in your letter you spent a fair amount of time highlighting the consequences of overly stringent capital requirements the risk of steering more activities to the less regulated nonbanks but what are some of the changes that youre scenario planning for whether its higher capital increase in fdic assessment fees and along those same lines how youre thinking about the buyback given continued strong capital build but a lot of macro uncertainty at the moment jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well i think you were already kind of complete with answering your own question there look were hoping that everyone just takes a deep breath and looks at what happened and the breadth and depth of regulations already in place obviously when something happens like this you should adjust think about it so i think down the road there may be some limitations on heldtomaturity maybe more tlac for certain typesize banks and more scrutiny on interest rate exposure and stuff like that but it doesnt have to be a revamp of the whole system just recalibrating things the right way and i think it should be done knowing what you want the outcome to be the outcome you should want is very strong community and regional banks and certain actions are taken which are drastic it could actually make them weaker so thats all it is we do expect higher capital from basel iv effectively and obviously theres going to be an fdic assessment thatll be what it is steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just in terms of appetite for the buyback just given some of the jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oh yeah jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc elevated macro uncertainties jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well weve told you that were kind of penciling in billion for this year obviously capital is more than that but and we did a little bit of buyback this quarter were going to wait and see we dont mind keeping our powder dry and youve seen us do that with investment portfolios and were also going to do that with capital steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great ill hop back into the queue thanks so much for taking my questions jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay operator thank you the next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies you may proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning hey jeremy i was just wondering if you can just give us a little bit more detail on those lower funding expectation points that you made just in terms of is it because of what you can offer the client that might allow you to kind of keep that beta lower and maybe you can just kind of wrap it into what your overall beta expectations are in that revised update thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so let me just summarize the drivers of the change in the outlook so the primary driver really is lower deposit rate paid expectations across both consumer and wholesale which as you mentioned is driven by a couple factors so the change in the rate environment with cuts coming sooner in the outlook all else equal does take some pressure off the reprice and as you said were getting a lot of positive feedback from the field on our product offerings the shortterm cd in particular is really getting a lot of positive feedback from our folks in the branches its been very attractive to yieldseeking customers so thats kind of working well and then on the asset side we are seeing a little bit higher card revolve which is helping and ill just remind you that at a conference in february i suggested that we were already starting to feel like some of the uncertainties we mentioned when giving the guidance had started all moving in the same direction and that was one of the things that contributed to the upward revision like all of the uncertainty kind of went the same way but as jamies pointed out those uncertainties are all still there we highlight them on the page and as we look forward to this year and to next year and the mediumterm we remain very focused on those ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 yeah and as a followup on the point about rate expectations coming now in and potentially getting cut sooner how do you take a look at what that might mean just for the broader economy do you think its more just because inflations coming down do you think its because the feds just got to react to an even tougher economy and still some of those storm clouds that might be out there just kind of your general thinking about the other readthroughs of what lower rates quicker will mean for the broader economy jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well first of all i dont quite believe it so the fed has the rate curve the forward shortterm rate curve almost at higher than what the market has so one of the things you got to always prepare for is it could be anything we dont know what the rate curve is going to be in a year and so were quite cautious in that and quite thoughtful about that obviously the shortterm read is higher recessionary risk and then inflation coming down so i think inflation will come down a little bit but it could easily be stickier than people think and therefore the rate curve will have to go up a little bit ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you very much operator thank you the next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research you may proceed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi thanks jeremy wanted to follow up again on the drivers of the nii revision and the lower rates paid assumption you mentioned the fed cuts coming sooner and positive feedback on the customer offers what about the march events do the bank failures there that happened in march in your view do they slow the reprice intensity because folks are moving other than price reasons or they intensify it industrywide because smaller banks have to reprice to keep their deposits how do those events influence your view of the reprice jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah john its a really good question and weve obviously thought about that but as we sit here today i guess i have two answers to that one is its not meaningfully affecting our current outlook we dont see it as a major driver and i think in terms of the larger dynamics that you lay out its just a little too early to tell but from where we are right now the base case is no real impact john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then i wanted to ask jamie theres a narrative out there that the industry could see a credit crunch banks are going to stop lending even jay powell mentioned that as a risk do you see that in terms of anything you look at in terms of lending and is that a reaction that makes sense that banks might be retrenching a lot here do you worry about that for the economy in terms of credit crunch thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 yeah i wouldnt use the word credit crunch if i were you obviously theres going to be a little bit of tightening and most of that will be around certain real estate things and youve heard it from real estate investors already so i just look at that as a kind of thumb on the scale it just makes the feds conditions be a little bit tighter increases the odds of a recession thats what that is its not like a credit crunch operator thank you our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning my first question is you mentioned that your reserve build was driven mostly by worse economic assumptions im wondering if you could update us on what unemployment rate youre assuming in your reserve jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so erika as you know we take not going to go into a lot of detail here but we take the outlook from our economists we run a bunch of different scenarios and we probabilityweight those the central case outlook from our research team hasnt actually changed but we felt that in line with what jamie just said in terms of a little bit of tightening as a result of the events of march it made sense to add a little bit of weight to our relative adverse case so we did that which changed the weightedaverage expectation and i think that the weightedaverage peak unemployment that were using now is something like erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc so as you think about all of what youve just told us so billion of nii this year and who knows when mediumterm is going to happen of mid the clear strength of the franchise producing rotce in a quarter where your cet1 is and a reserve that already reflects unemployment as we think about recession and what jpmorgan can earn in a recession do you think you can hit rotce even in assuming we do have a recession in as everybody is expecting given all these revenue dynamics and how prepared you are on the reserve jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean thats an interesting question erika i guess ill say a couple things jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its a great question so i want to see how jeremy answers it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay lets take a crack lets see what the boss thinks i think number one we believe have said and continue to believe that this is fundamentally a through the cycle rotce franchise so number one number two as jamie always says we run this company for all different scenarios and to have it be as resilient as possible across all different scenarios jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 on the particular question of rotce expectations in contingent on the particular economic outlook obviously it depends a lot on the nature of the recession i think we feel really good about how the company is positioned for a recession but were a bank a very serious recession is of course going to be a headwind for returns but we think even in a fairly severe recession well deliver very good returns whether thats or not is too much detail for now erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator the next question comes from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a little bit on the deposit your thought process there youve seen some inflows why do you think that you lose them going forward and just maybe talk a little bit about the dynamic in pricing do you feel like given the inflows do you see some pricing power for the larger banks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah a couple things there so first of all we dont know right the deposits just came in we dont know were guessing number two the deposits just came in so by definition these are somewhat flighty deposits because they just came into us so its prudent and appropriate for us to assume that they wont be particularly stable number three theres a natural amount of internal migration of deposits to money funds so you have to overlay that and thats embedded in our assumptions and number four its a competitive market and its entirely possible that people temporarily come to us and then over time decide to go elsewhere so for all of those reasons were just being realistic about the stickiness of it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co if i add i would say categorically theres no pricing power that the bigger banks have because if you look at the pricing we look at pricing sheets all the time every bank is in a slightly different position and every bank is competing in threemonth sixmonth ninemonth savings rates and then you have the online banks you got treasury bills you got money market funds theres no pricing power for the bank but obviously we all have different franchises and were all in a slightly different position jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no fair all fair points and maybe just a followup on johns question on the lending environment you talked about the industry likely pulling back are you changing your underwriting standards in any way just trying to think through is there potential for some market share gains given your strength of capital and liquidity or how youre thinking about the loan environment jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 id say very modestly but we look at that all the time jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and we always say right we underwrite through the cycle and i think notably we didnt loosen our underwriting standards when all the numbers looked crazy good during the pandemic and were not going to overreact now and tighten unreasonably some of that correction happens naturally credit metrics deteriorate for borrowers whether in consumer or wholesale and that might make them leave our preexisting risk appetite but were not running around aggressively tightening standards right now jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks operator the next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets you may proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc in your comments about your cet1 ratio obviously it came in strong at youve got the gsib buffers obviously going up next year and we have the stress test coming this summer or in june the results which maybe will lead to banks including yours having a higher stress capital buffer where should we think about that cet1 ratio being by the end of the year do you think jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so a few things on there gerard so we have previously said that we were targeting in the first quarter of as a function of assuming an unchanged scb the increased gsib step and operating with a basispoint buffer so the point that jamie made a second ago in light of the environment basel iv dry powder who knows how well tweak that going forward but thats still our base case assumption specifically on the stress test contrary to what ive heard some people argue our ability to predict the scb ahead of time from running our own process is actually quite limited and youll remember last year that even though we did predict an increase we were off by almost a factor of two in terms of how big it wound up being and that was a big surprise for the whole industry so we want to be quite humble about our ability to predict the scb jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 but having said that for right now we are assuming it will be unchanged there are some tailwinds in there through the oci but we believe there will likely be some offsets and harsher credit shocks in the numbers so for planning purposes right now were assuming flat for scb and well know soon enough what that actual number is gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure and then just as a followup if i heard you correctly can you give us a little more color i think you mentioned in building loan loss reserve this quarter you identified some oneoff credits i dont know if thats how you said it theres some larger credits were they commercial real estate oriented were they commercial any more color there jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co no it wasnt commercial real estate it was just a couple of single name items in the corporate segment gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc leverage loantype items or just regular corporate credits jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co regular corporate credits id rather not get into too much detail gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co gerard sorry thanks gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator the next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning i guess maybe one question jeremy you reminded us of the relatively low office exposure for jpm but obviously youre big players in the cre market just give us a sense of when you look at the two pressure points on cre one how much is oversupply and that probably goes beyond office into apartments how much of a issue is oversupply in the market as we think about the next few years going into a weakening jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 economy and how much of a risk is higher for longer rates in that if the central banks cant cut rates in the next year or two we will see a ton of more pain because of the refi wall thats coming up jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so ebrahim let me sort of respond narrowly in connection with our portfolio and our exposure right so really the large majority of our commercial real estate exposure is multifamily lending in supply constrained markets and i think its quite important to recognize the difference between that and sort of higher end higher price point nonrent controlled not supply constrained markets so our space is really quite different in that respect and i think thats a big part of the reason the performance has been so good for so long so of course we watch it very carefully and we dont assume that past performance predicts future results here but i think our multifamily lending portfolio is quite low risk in the scheme of things jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just add also housing is in short supply in america its not massively oversupplied like you saw in jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and then in terms of the office space as you know our exposure is quite small yes jamie has also mentioned all the refi dynamics that you mentioned too are something that the office space is processing one way or the other our office exposure is quite modest very concentrated in class a buildings in sort of dense urban locations where the return to the office narrative is one of the drivers is generally in favor of high occupancy so again watching it there are obviously specific things here and there to pay attention to but in the scheme of things for us not a big issue ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and just as a follow up i think the other risk from higher for longer rates i think is this the ability of the economy the financial markets to sustain a less fed fund for a long period of time like what are the other areas youre watching if duration mismatch and bank balance sheets being one cre market being one are you worrying worried about nonbanks that have grown exponentially over the last decade in terms of risks at the nonbanks if rates dont get cut and if you can talk to the transmission mechanism of that coming back and hitting banks given the leverage that banks provide to the nonbanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so id like to answer that so there is a risk of higher rates for longer and dont just think of just the fed funds rate because i think you should for our planning id be thinking more about it could be and then think about the five and tenyear rate which could be and i think if those things happen im not saying theyre going to happen i just think people should prepare for them they saw what just happened when rates went up beyond peoples expectations you had the gilt problem in london you had some of the banks here people need to be prepared for the potential of higher rates for longer if and when that happens it will undress problems in the economy for those who are too exposed to floating rates for those who are too exposed to refi risk those exposures will be in multiple parts of the economy i say to all of jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 our clients now would be the time to fix it do not put yourself in a position where that risk is excessive for your company your business your investment pools et cetera thats answer number one number two is it will not come back to jpmorgan okay while we do provide credit to what you call shadow banks it is very we think its very very secure that does not mean it wont come back to other credit providers ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it very helpful thank you operator the next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey jeremy you mentioned a degree of reintermediation to the lending markets you said capital markets activity has gone to bank lending and im just wondering as part of your billion increased nii guide are you assuming better loan spreads and on the topic of loan pricing why arent your credit card yields going higher than where they are today thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mike so i think yeah youre referring to my comments that i made in the commercial bank about the fact that the larger corporate segment within the commercial bank that would generally have access to capital markets but also access to bank lending at the margin is choosing to draw down revolvers right now rather than access the capital markets that is not a particularly meaningful driver of the increase in nii guidance theres a lot of odds and ends in there but the major drivers are the ones that i called out and to be honest i havent actually specifically checked whats happening with card yields i would imagine that theyve gone up a little bit in line with rates but i dont know we should follow up here mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right and then one for you jamie i guess taking the foot level i guess when you look at asset liability management or alm you could call this nightmare on alm street and youve seen some big problems at banks and i guess how would you evaluate yourself i guess with this billion higher nii guide it probably is good but to what degree are you willing to sacrifice jpm shareholder money to help rescue problem banks that did not get their asset liability management correctly jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well its two really different questions so weve been quite cautious on interest rates for quite a while and how we invest our portfolio what our expectations are our stress testing the stress test the ccar stress test as you know had rates going down i always looked at rates going up and being prepared whether or not anything is going to happen so weve been quite conservative ourselves and we dont mind continuing to do that because i remind people that having excess capital you havent lost it its kind of earnings in store you get to deploy it later and maybe at a more opportune time when the time comes jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 and look we like to help the system when it needs help if we can reasonably and were not the only ones you saw a lot of banks do that and i was proud of them i think all of us did the right thing whether ultimately it works out or not well you could secondguess that when it happens but the fact is i think people want to help the system and this whole banking thing was bad for banks and i knew that the second i saw the headline and then you had credit suisse we want healthy community banks we want healthy regional banks we want to help them get through this we have youll remember mike as you point out we have the best financial system the worlds ever seen that does not mean it wont have problems doesnt mean there shouldnt be changes made but i think its reasonable for people to help each other in times of need and we all did that all of us did that during covid all of us did that if you could those who could did it during the great financial crisis and i would expect people to do that going forward mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey jamie your ceo letter said the banking crisis isnt over so what do you mean by that or was that dated two weeks later are you talking contagion or what jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so its just the number of banks offsides you can count on your hands in terms of too much interest rate exposure too much atm too much uninsured deposits and so there may be additional bank failures something like that which we dont know but youre going to see next week regional banks have pretty good numbers a lot of people are going to have can take actions to remediate some of the issues they may have going forward youve already seen things calm down quite a bit particularly in deposit flows warren buffett was on tv talking about that he would bet million i dont know if you saw that that no depositor will lose money in america that hes willing to bet his own money and of course you know hes a very bright man so this crisis is not it will pass and the one thing i pointed out is when i answered the question just before about interest rates people need to be prepared they shouldnt pray that they dont go up they should prepare for them going up and if it doesnt happen serendipity mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator the next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley you may proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i do want to unpack the question here on the possibility of higher for longer rates and how that impacts you in your nonmarkets nii jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co betsy did we just lose you i feel like you just dropped betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc no hear me hello jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah youre back now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so i just wanted to unpack the higher for longer rate possibility as to how it impacts your nii because your nii guide is assuming the forward curve if i understand correctly so in the event that you get that higher for longer just how much does that impact nii ex markets because im trying to triangulate here about maybe you lose some deposits but if we have higher for longer shouldnt we expect the trajectory goes up from this quarter as opposed to down is that thats the question jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead jeremy and then ill go jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so betsy your question is very good and i would say that if you look at the evolution of our outlook last year it was pretty clear that we were very assetsensitive certainly in terms of the sort of one year forward ear type measure you also obviously know that our current ear actually shows a slight negative number so a tiny bit liability sensitive and i wont get into all the nuances about why that may or may not be a great predictor in the shortterm but the point is that the level of rates now is of course very different from what it was last year and at jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 this level of rates the relationship between our shortterm nii evolution and the curve is not always going to be clear in any given moment its quite tricky and it can behave in somewhat wonky ways as a function of again what ive alluded to a couple times on this call the competitive environment for deposits which is not in fact a sort of mathematically predictable thing as a function of the rate curve so thats why were emphasizing all the different drivers of uncertainty in the nii outlook yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so ill just add so next quarter we all kind of know already two quarters out we know a little bit less three quarters out we know a little bit less and we know very little that number you could imagine this is a little inside baseball now the number that were talking about for is not based upon an implied curve its based upon us looking at multiple potential scenarios leveling them kind of out and saying this is kind of a range and youre absolutely correct you could have an environment of higher for longer that might be better than that but remember higher for longer comes with a lot of other things attached to it like maybe a recession stagflation lower volumes so i wouldnt look at that as higher for longer is a positive it might be a slight positive on that line it would probably would be a negative on other lines betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah got it okay thats super helpful to understand how you think through that and then the followup is just on the buybacks so do i take your comments to mean that youre on pause now and if thats the case what would be the driver of restarting jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no were not on pause now were doing a little bit now we obviously have a lot of excess capital we also like to buy our stock when its cheap not just when its available and were also peering ahead looking at those little bit of storm clouds so were going to be kind of cautious so were going to make this decision every day we also dont like to tell the market what were doing just so you know betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and then can you give us any sense of what basel iv endgame means to you in your rwas how much should we be baking in for those jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah betsy we really dont have any new information there right i mean i think clearly if you go back like a year we were maybe a little bit more optimistic that it might be across all the different levers and all the different pieces of it closer to capital neutral i think now it feels like its likely to be worse than that hopefully its not too much worse than that and i would just remind you that there are a lot of different levers so when the npr comes thats only going to be a part of it theres going to be other pieces the holistic review and its going to take a lot of time to phase in and were going to have time to adjust so well know when we know jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and there were supposed i just remembered there were supposed to be pauses in there about how they looked at banks relative to the global economy which are getting smaller the sgifi was supposed to be adjusted for that so it may very were expecting it go up but there are a lot of reasons why it shouldnt go up and jpmorgan theres so much capital i mean so you cant look at jpmorgan and say well its a capital issue and even the banks by the way when you look at it even though some of the banks are in trouble they have plenty of capital their issue wasnt capital it was other things and so im just hoping regulators are very thoughtful and the other thing is they should a priori decide what they want out of the banking system at this point because ive made it clear i can look at the banking system and say that no bank should keep a loan if possible thats how much capital is now being required for loans betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc this is based on the current rule set jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah because the market is pricing holds the market would take loans at much lower capital ratio than banks are being forced to hold for them im talking about just loans only so thats why youre seeing a lot of capital go to i mean a lot of credit go to nonbanks and dramatically by the way rapidly and dramatically and so if youre a regulator you should be looking at it and saying do i want that is that a good thing for the system if you believe its a good thing for the system raise the capital and more credit will go out of the system thats fine if thats what they want thats fine but they should do it with a forethought not accidentally betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i like the nii from loans better than the gain on sale so ill prefer the former not the latter but thanks appreciate it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes operator thank you the next question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is now open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 thank you so you talked about in your letter about regulators avoiding the kneejerk reaction which you addressed earlier im curious on your thoughts around how customers have reacted and should react now my point my question is consumers can move excess cash balances if they want more insurance they can do that in a lot of different ways move it treasuries money market extra accounts whatever the issue the question i have for you is on the corporate side have you seen big changes in how corporate treasurers or cfos are adapting their cash balances and working capital and should they need to and i appreciate your warren buffett comments jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah glenn in short we really havent seen big changes to speak of and i do think its just worth saying i think youre sort of hinting at this a little bit when you talk about the behavior of corporates that when we talk about responses to the recent events through the lens of uninsured deposits thats obviously very different if youre talking about large balances of nonoperating uninsured deposits from financial institutions or de facto financial institutions versus normal large corporate operating balances which is of course like core banking business for all of us jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co when we saw it in commercial banking payments investment banking and custody you did see money move or i would call excess cash was moved out but they have options what i would call more like operational cash so think even of a small companies middle market companies et cetera that tends to be fairly sticky because you have your loans there you have your money there youre getting more and more competitive in rates and thats why i think you see lot of regional banks theyve got sticky middle market deposits if i lent you million and you have million youre probably going to leave it at my bank and they also are more competitive on the rate for that so i think you shouldnt be looking at deposit like one class theres a whole bunch of different types and analytically you go through each one and try to figure out what the stickiness is and what the stickiness is and et cetera and so on but i think they have already as the fed has raised rates youve already seen thats the reason we expected outflows both from consumers and corporate customers glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi interesting just followup the other thing that caught my eye in the letter is you mentioned that youre exploring new capital optimization strategies including partnerships and securitizations whats different than what youve already been doing for the last years jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co weve got our smartest people were going to figure out every angle to reduce capital requirements for jpmorgan thats the difference and weve been doing it but theres securitizations there are partnerships youre seeing a lot of the private equity do the life insurance companies and i expect that were going to come up with a whole bunch of different things over time and well shed certain assets too glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi yeah thanks jamie jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 operator our final question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank you may proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning you guys talked about one of the drivers of the higher net interest income guide this year is due to likely higher credit card balances and i was just wondering if you could flush out what changed there on the outlook today versus three months ago and i guess is it a good or bad thing that those balances will be higher than you thought jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so the story there is kind of the same story weve been talking about for a while its just a matter of degree so we had revolving balances obviously drop a lot during the pandemic period and then we talked about having them recover in absolute dollar terms to the same level as wed had prepandemic which i think happened last quarter and then the remaining narrative is just the further normalization of the revolve peraccount because we also have seen some account growth and that continues to happen and so also to mikes question earlier were seeing a higher yield there as well so and on your question of whether its good or bad obviously theres a point at which the consumers have too much leverage we dont see that yet so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its normalization jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its a good thing for us jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately to squeeze in you guys took some securities losses again this quarter and in the past youve talked about really just going securitybysecurity looking for kind of pricing opportunities is that kind of what drove it again this quarter or is there some kind of broader overarching jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 14apr2023 thatll be every quarter for the rest of our lives sell what we find rich and we buy what we think is dear jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co cheap jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co cheap matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right thank you operator
