management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases fourth quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your lines will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please standby at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jennifer piepszak ms piepszak please go ahead jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone the presentation as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back its slightly longer this quarter given were not having investor day and so after i review our results ill spend some time on our outlook for as well as touch on a few important balance sheet topics that are top of mind for us so starting on page for the fourth quarter the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of included in these results are approximately billion of credit reserve releases before we get into more detail on our performance ill just touch on a few highlights first off our customers and clients continue to demonstrate strong financial resilience in the face of an unprecedented pandemic as evidenced in our credit metrics thus far we saw continued momentum in investment banking and grew our share to in cib markets revenue was up yearonyear driven by strong client activity and elevated volatility in the quarter and in awm we had record revenue up yearonyear on deposits we saw another quarter of strong growth up yearonyear and sequentially as fed balance sheet expansion continues to increase the overall amount of cash in the system while loan growth remained muted up both yearonyear and quarteronquarter on to page for more on our fourth quarter results revenue of billion was up billion or yearon year net interest income was down approximately million or primarily driven by lower rates and mix partly offset by balance sheet growth and higher markets nii noninterest revenue was up billion or on higher ib fees legacy investment gains in corporate and higher production revenue in home lending expenses of billion were down yearonyear on lower volume and revenuerelated expenses partially offset by continued investments credit costs were a net benefit of billion down billion yearonyear primarily driven by reserve releases of billion that ill cover in more detail shortly turning to the full year results on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on record revenue of nearly billion and delivered a return on tangible common equity of revenue was up billion or yearonyear and net interest income was down billion or on lower rates partly offset by higher markets nii and balance sheet growth and noninterest revenue was up billion or on higher markets and ib fees as well as higher production revenue in home lending expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by volume and revenuerelated expenses higher legal and continued investments partially offset by lower structural expenses and credit costs were billion reflecting a net reserve build of billion due to the impacts of covid19 and net chargeoffs that were down yearonyear jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 now turning to reserves on page we released approximately billion of reserves this quarter across wholesale and home lending starting with wholesale we released billion due to improving macroeconomic scenarios and the continued ability of our clients to access capital markets and liquidity in home lending we released million primarily on improvement in hpi expectations and to a lesser extent portfolio runoff and in card we held reserves flat as we remain cautious about the nearterm especially with the number of unemployed still nearly two times prepandemic levels and potential payment shock coming to consumers from expiring benefits and so with the nearterm outlook still quite uncertain we remain heavily weighted to our downside scenarios and at nearly billion we are reserved at approximately billion above the current base case and to touch on net chargeoffs for the quarter they were down about million yearonyear and remain relatively low across our portfolios looking forward we still dont expect any meaningful increases in chargeoffs until the second half of and with the recent stimulus it could be even later turning to page weve included here an update on our customer assistance programs and you can see the trends are largely similar to last quarter and further evidence of the resilience of our customers the vast majority of whats left in deferral is in mortgage with billion of own loans and billion in our service portfolio and in terms of what were seeing from our customers that have exited relief more than of accounts remain current turning to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of flat versus the prior quarter on strong earnings generation largely offset by dividends of billion and higher rwa as we stated in our press release last month the board has authorized share repurchases and we plan to resume buybacks in the first quarter up to our fed authorized capacity of billion after paying our dividend you can see here on the page weve included the liquidity coverage ratios for both the firm and the bank which we believe is important to look at together in order to better understand the liquidity profile of our balance sheet the firm is at a healthy lcr of however the bank lcr is reflecting the extraordinary deposit growth that has meaningfully outpaced loan demand now lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page in the fourth quarter ccb reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was down yearon year reflecting deposit margin compression and lower card nii on lower balances largely offset by strong deposit growth and higher home lending production revenue deposit growth was yearonyear up over billion as balances remain elevated and as we continue to acquire new customers and deepen primary relationships loans were down yearonyear with home lending down due to portfolio runoff and card down on lower spend offset by business banking which was up due to ppp loans client investment assets were up year onyear driven by both net inflows and market performance on spend combined debit and credit card sales volume in the quarter was up yearonyear which reflected debit sales up largely driven by retail and everyday spend and credit sales down largely driven by te in home lending overall production margins remained strong total originations were down yearonyear but were up quarteronquarter both driven by correspondent as we lean into the channel after pulling back earlier in the year for the year total originations were billion including nearly billion of consumer originations both the highest since in auto loan and lease origination volume was billion up yearonyear and across the franchise digital engagement continues to accelerate our customers use quickdeposit for more than of all check deposits jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 which is nearly percentage points higher than a year ago and in home lending nearly twothirds of our consumer applications were completed digitally using chase myhome and that has tripled since the first quarter overall of our customers are digitally active with business banking at both higher than a year ago expenses of billion were down yearonyear and credit costs were a net benefit of million driven by million of reserve releases in home lending largely offset by net chargeoffs in card of million now turning to the corporate investment bank on page cib reported net income of billion and an roe of on revenue of billion for the fourth quarter and an roe of on revenue of billion for the full year the extraordinary nature of this year has meant that we had records in almost every category for both the quarter and the full year in investment banking ib fees were up for the year and we grew share to its highest level in a decade for the quarter investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear and up sequentially the quarters performance was driven by the continued momentum in the equity issuance market as well as strong performances in dcm and ma in advisory we were up yearonyear driven by the closing of several large transactions the ma market continued to strengthen this quarter and in fact announced volumes exceeded precovid levels debt underwriting fees were up yearonyear driven by leveraged finance activity and we maintained our number one rank overall in equity underwriting fees were up yearonyear primarily driven by our strong performance in followons and ipos looking forward we expect ib fees to be up modestly for the first quarter and the overall pipeline remains robust we expect ma to remain active on improved overall ceo confidence and the momentum in equity capital markets is expected to continue of course dependent on the successful containment of covid moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear against a record fourth quarter last year fixed income was up yearonyear driven by good client activity across businesses particularly in spread products as well as a favorable trading environment in currencies emerging markets credit and commodities equities was up yearonyear driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash throughout the quarter across both flow trading and large episodic transactions looking forward we expect markets to remain active in the first quarter and we have seen strong performance since the start of january but its obviously too early to predict the full quarter and for the remaining quarters of this year and the full year the comparisons will be particularly challenging given the extraordinary performance of markets in wholesale payments revenue of billion was down yearonyear primarily reflecting the reporting reclass in merchant services and securities services revenue of billion was down yearonyear on a full year basis the headwinds from lower rates were almost entirely offset by robust deposit growth expenses of billion were down compared to the prior year driven by lower compensation and legal expenses now lets go to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion and an roe of revenue of billion was up yearonyear with higher lending and investment banking revenue partially offset by lower deposit revenue record gross investment banking revenue of million was up yearonyear and the full year was also a record finishing at billion surpassing our previously established billion longterm target and given our investments in banker coverage we believe theres continued upside from here jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 expenses of million were flat yearonyear deposits of billion were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter as client balances remain elevated average loans were up yearonyear but down sequentially ci loans were down on lower revolver balances with utilization rates nearing record lows as clients continue to access capital markets for liquidity and cre loans were down on higher prepayment activity in both ctl and real estate banking finally credit costs were a net benefit of billion driven by reserve releases now on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management reported net income of million with pretax margin and roe of and for the year awm generated record net income of billion with pretax margin and roe of for the quarter revenue of billion was up yearonyear as higher performance and management fees as well as growth in deposit and loan balances were partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses at billion were up yearonyear primarily due to higher legal expenses related to the resolution of matters previously announced but excluding this expenses would have been up yearonyear on volume and revenuerelated expenses for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion positive across all channels asset classes and regions and this was true of the billion for the full year as well in liquidity we saw net outflows of billion for the quarter and net inflows of billion for the full year aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by net inflows into both liquidity and longterm products as well as higher market levels and finally deposits were up yearonyear and loans were up as clients continue to increase their liquidity and look for investment opportunities now onto corporate on page corporate reported net loss of million revenue was a loss of approximately million relatively flat yearonyear net interest income was down million on lower rates including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities as well as limited deployment opportunities on the back of continued deposit growth declines in net interest income were largely offset by net gains this quarter of approximately million on several legacy equity investments and expenses of million were roughly flat yearonyear as well now shifting gears ill turn to our outlook for which ill cover over the next few pages starting with nii on page as you can see on the page we expect nii to be around billion in and this is based on the latest implieds which reflects the steepening yield curve weve seen over the past few weeks so you can see that we do expect to be able to more than offset the impact of low rates in from continued deposit growth and higher markets nii but its important to note that it takes loan growth to truly realize the benefits of a steeper yield curve ill also just remind you that the increase in cib markets nii is largely offset in nir and this component is highly market dependent and so as it relates to loan growth while there should be some opportunities in awm and wholesale we expect headwinds at least in the near term as corporate cash balances are at alltime highs card payment rates are elevated and there continues to be significant prepayments in home lending but we do expect these to normalize and see loan growth pick up in the second half of the year particularly in card therefore our fourth quarter nii estimate of billion or more is a reasonable exit rate and notably thats in the zip code of our nii when rates were significantly higher than they are today weve also included on the right side of the page some risks and opportunities and obviously this isnt an exhaustive list but are the drivers that could be most impactful to this years nii outlook jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 now turning to expenses on page as jamie mentioned last month we do expect our expenses to increase in and based on our latest work we expect that number to be around billion up versus the prior guidance of billion largely due to higher volume and revenuerelated expenses and the impact of fx both of which have offsets in the revenue line as well as the impact of expenses from our recent acquisition of cxloyalty then taking a look at the yearoveryear expense growth you can see its primarily due to investments which ill cover in more detail on the next page our volume and revenuerelated expenses are up slightly with some puts and takes there thats obviously marketdependent but remember any changes there do come with corresponding changes to our top line and in structural we expect a net reduction of approximately million notably this includes a decrease of million reflecting the realization of continued cost efficiencies in what is largely our fixed cost base and you can see that it is partially offset by the impact of fx on our nonus dollar expenses its important to note that while structural is coming down this doesnt represent the full extent of our productivity were realizing efficiencies in each category here for example our software engineers are becoming more productive and we are reducing our cost to serve as we see more customers use our digital tools to selfserve moving to page to take a closer look at our investment spend over the past two years our investment spend has been around billion and we expect that to increase to nearly billion in you can see that we highlighted on the page the major areas of focus that weve been consistently investing in for years which have continued to strengthen our franchise and drive revenue growth starting on the bottom with technology this represents roughly half of the overall investment spend and these tech investments are across the board as we look to better meet our customer and client needs improve our customers digital experience strengthen our fraud detection capabilities as well as modernize and improve our technology infrastructure cloud and data capabilities moving to nontech investments we expect marketing spend largely ccb to return to precovid levels this year after being down in we continue to invest in our distribution capabilities across all of our businesses this includes hiring bankers and advisors not only in the us but also internationally as well as expanding our physical footprint weve been continuing to execute against our branch expansion plans in new markets having opened branches so far out of our planned and expect to be in all contiguous states by mid2021 jamies clapping and the other bucket on the page is a catchall for everything else including real estate and other various investments across our businesses these expenses were fairly stable the past two years and the increase in is largely related to our billion commitment to the path forward which includes promoting affordable housing expanding home ownership for underserved communities and supporting minorityowned businesses and then as well as expenses related to our acquisition of cxloyalty so in summary you can see that we continue to invest through the cycle and its these investments that we believe position us well to outperform on a relative basis regardless of the environment now ill turn to a few balance sheet and capitalrelated topics starting on page over the next few slides id like to provide you some insight on how recent monetary expansion and corresponding growth in the financial system is creating new challenges for bank balance sheets more specifically this expansion is putting significant pressure on sizebased capital requirements which is likely to impact business decisions including capital targets jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 well start with what has happened this year in response to the covid crisis the feds balance sheet has significantly expanded which has resulted in trillion of domestic deposit growth across the us commercial banks whats important to note is that this qe is unlike anything weve seen before in the current qe we have experienced a much bigger and faster expansion and that expansion has come without meaningful loan demand beyond ppp as you can see in the loan to deposit ratio on the page this has resulted in bank balance sheets which are larger but more liquid and less risky from a bank capital perspective the key question to ask is how long will this persist on the chart you can see that the qe3 unwind kept the fed on pause for several years before a modest pace of reduction so even if the fed immediately signals tapering which of course is not the base case and follows the pace of the last unwind it will take many years to return to precovid levels of course the unwind speed is uncertain but i think we can all agree that bank balance sheets will remain elevated for some time now lets go to page and see how this will impact capital going forward two factors that are top of mind for us are gsib which weve been talking about for a long time and also slr which is not something we typically talk about but given the overall system expansion is now in focus on the graph what you can see here are the historical trends of gsib and slrbased requirements overlaid with the path of the feds securities holdings you can see that during the original calibration of these rules which included significant gold plating the fed balance sheet was notably lower with the recent growth in the fed balance sheet we are seeing upward pressure and increases to gsib requirement as well as the slr shifting from a backstop to a binding measure which would impact the pace of capital return and these dynamics will likely persist for an extended period the feds temporary relief of slr expires after march 31st this adjustment for cash and treasury should either be made permanent or at a minimum be extended with these exclusions you can see how this remains a backstop measure not a binding one then on gsib there has been public dialogue about the need to index the score to gdp as a proxy to account for ordinary economic expansion over time and this was also cited by the fed as a possible shortcoming of their framework for gdp was clearly not the best proxy for system expansion but the principle still applies g sib was designed as a relative measure between large and mediumsize banks and therefore it should certainly reflect an overall system expansion which impacted small medium and large banks alike by futureproofing g sib at inception with the adjustments outlined on the page you can see the resulting gsib score profile lower over time but more importantly flatter over the course of the most recent system expansion while we recognize that prudent bank capital requirements do promote safety and soundness satisfying these heightened requirements is certainly not costless which is why these two areas gsib and leverage are top of mind for us in now lets look at the impact of this on marginal deposits on page in addition to what weve already discussed there are two more building blocks required to see the full picture of marginal deposit economics and they are interest rates and loan demand weve experienced a combination of both lower interest rates and lower loan demand which have reduced the nim of marginal deposits to practically zero which you can see here on the chart and this is an issue for all banks not just gsibs or jpmorgan however what is specific to the larger banks is that when the slr becomes binding we may be required to issue new debt and retain higher equity which ultimately makes the marginal deposit a negative roe proposition in todays ultralow rate environment the key question is what could happen next we could simply shy away from taking new deposits redirecting them elsewhere in the system or we can issue or retain additional capital and pass on some of that cost which is jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 certainly something we wouldnt want to do in this environment and therefore we strongly encourage a serious look at these sizebased capital calibrations with an appropriate sense of urgency as we will soon be facing this critical business decision all of this can be addressed through a few simple adjustments namely an extension of the slr exclusion and the gsib fixes weve spoken about over time but to be clear we believe the framework as a whole has made the banking system safer as we experienced in but were also seeing evidence where the lack of coherence in recalibration is risking unintended consequences going forward with all that said before i close things out on capital heres how were thinking about target cet1 levels while gsib pressure remains and the need for recalibration is high our scb optimization can provide some offset allowing us to manage to a cet1 target the recent stress test showed an implied basis point reduction to scb and we have continued our optimization efforts since the resubmission so were hopeful for a lower scb later this year of course thats scenario dependent at this point its too early to provide specific color on the impact of slr so its just important to note that in the absence of any adjustments to the measure we may have to issue preferreds or carry additional cet1 over the target i just mentioned we obviously cant emphasize these key messages enough and these factors are clearly frontandcenter as we think about managing our balance sheet and capital targets in the near and medium term now before we conclude note that weve included a few additional slides on our businesses in the appendix to give you an update on their strategic highlights and performance as well as provide the latest financial outlook the themes and initiatives we talked about at last years investor day still remain our focus and we continue to execute and make progress against them so to wrap up was an incredibly challenging year but it also showcased the benefits of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company while our employees relentlessly focused on supporting our customers clients and communities while downside risks do remain in the near term and they could be significant several recent factors help us feel more optimistic as we look ahead to the recovery in the medium and longerterm so with that operator please open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions your first question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jamie good morning jenn and happy new year jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you steven jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thank you steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so i want to start off with a question on the nii outlook the guide implies a rather healthy stepup versus the billion jamie that you had reiterated just last month in your updated nii guide for what are you assuming regarding the deployment of excess liquidity given some of the recent curve steepening and separately what are your assumptions around the trajectory for card balances and overall growth in especially in light of the expectations for additional stimulus which we saw at least this past year could drive further consumer deleveraging jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill start with excess liquidity so i think there the theme is were being opportunistic but patient so as you think about the recent moves that weve seen in the yield curve in the grand scheme of things those could be small moves and as we think about managing the balance sheet its not just about nii of course its about capital and so there is risk in adding duration at these levels in a further selloff so were being very patient but we have been and will continue to be optimistic and you will have seen that we did add billion to the portfolio in the fourth quarter so thats what were assuming in the outlook is a very balanced view on deploying the excess liquidity and then jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and the implied curve jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes and the implied curve yeah and then on card balances it is quite extraordinary what were seeing in terms of payment rates in the card portfolio which of course is very healthy as consumers use this opportunity to jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 deleverage so there is an offset in the on credit line but we are expecting that to normalize in the back half of as spend recovers but it is certainly a risk for us if they remain elevated so thats why everything was put on that page in the plusminus because everything could be an opportunity and a risk steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough and just for my followup wanted to ask on capital thought the slides were really interesting highlighting the impact of qe on the leverage ratio and gsib scores youve been critical of gsib surcharges and the need to recalibrate these coefficients for some time we havent really seen much progress there kind of feels like waiting for godot and if the fed is slow to recalibrate the minimum leverage ratios to account for this qedriven deposit growth what mitigating actions can you take to ensure youre not capitalconstrained as balance sheet growth continues and maybe any revenue attrition we need to contemplate as part of those mitigating actions jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill start with gsib if we take that in turn so starting with gsib as i said we do think that we have opportunity in the scb of course thats scenariodependent and based on the fed models but we do think we have opportunity there based on the work that weve been doing it will be very difficult for us to get back to with the current expansion so we are expecting to remain in the bucket but as you know thats not effective until early so that gives us time to manage scb as i mentioned as an offset on the leverage issues we have we can cure this through issuing preferreds but we havent made that decision yet as i said because it is a critical decision for us to think about and as you think about capital returns it would depend on where our stock price is as we think about the economic value of issuing preferreds to buy back stocks so theres a lot for us to think about over the next couple of months jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and could i just add in the gsifi because its very important if we were on the international standard our gsifi would be not and weve been talking about they were supposed to adjust gsifi for the growth of the economy and effectively the shrinking size of the banking system because the banking system itself is getting smaller as mortgages go to nonbanks and private credit goes elsewhere and the rest of the international chinese banks are growing et cetera so these adjustments should be made and we pointed out theres trillion of liquid assets and marketable securities on our balance sheet which shockingly drive gsifi too gsifi has no riskweighted measurements to it no diversification to it no profitability to it it just kind of use very gross measures and it needs to be recalibrated and same with slr i mean so do we expect it to happen probably not in our lifetimes because weve politicized detailed bank numbers and so and we can live with it for now but in the long run its not good for america to be that much of a disadvantage to our competitors overseas operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global securities jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 hi jim james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc sorry hi sorry i was on a mute for a second there maybe just talking about loan growth you saw a pretty nice improvement in the wholesale side you talked about some opportunities in it seems to be mostly coming outs of cib is that sort of acquisition finance whats driving some of the improvement on the wholesale side jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i would say acquisition financing is the opportunity on the wholesale side there may be some opportunity in the back half of in ci that feels like its returning to bau but i think thats going to take some time but as i said we are at historic levels of cash on corporate balance sheets and so outside of acquisition financing and ci it will be challenging ci in the back half of james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay fair enough and then maybe on your expense assumptions for the billion you dont really mention at all the cib you would think that if we are as everyone assumes we had a record year in maybe markets and ib fees are lower is there any kind of are you building in some lower revenuebased compensation expense in that billion or is that potential a positive jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so we capture that in the volume and revenuerelated jim it just happens to be more than offset by volume and revenuerelated growth elsewhere indiscernible jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and could i just point out the billion we dont make commitments or promises so that billion i would love to find billion more of investments literally i mean were seeking everywhere to find more to do to help clients around the world and stuff like that so thats just kind of our current forecast and fortunately we found some more to do including cxloyalty and opening more branches and some of the technology were building et cetera but id like to find more it would be the best and possible highest use of our capital operator your next question comes from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi john john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi jenn given the outlook for net interest income and expenses it seems like the efficiency ratio is going to tick up a few hundred basis points this year in versus and i know you dont manage it necessarily yearto year but just kind of over time you seem to have a mid efficiency target just kind of wondering how you put jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 guardrails up for yourselves in terms of expense discipline and managing over time to have positive operating leverage and an efficiency corridor jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill start by saying youre absolutely right we dont manage the efficiency ratio in any quarter even any year but operating leverage is very important to us and then we gave shared at investor day of about a efficiency ratio ill say in a normalized environment we havent had anything that structurally has changed and so that should still be achievable for us in a normalized rate environment and otherwise normalized environment and then as it relates to expense discipline it is a bottomsup process and so everywhere around this company we are looking to get more efficient and holding people accountable to do just that which is why i call out on the slide that structural is basically everything that isnt investments or volume and revenue related it isnt necessarily a representation of all of our expense efficiency so the discipline is everywhere and its the way we run the company and we do believe in the importance of operating leverage through time no doubt john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then as a followup on the nii walk youve got billion incremental nii expected in versus from markets cib markets can that be true if markets revenues is down yearoveryear can they both be true and just maybe explain that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes it can absolutely be true so markets is i mean most of our businesses we dont run them nii versus non interest revenue it is an accounting construct but markets its particularly true so yes that is possible in nii the markets business you can think about its liabilitysensitive so youre going to see the benefit of lower rates in nii that doesnt necessarily imply anything about the overall performance jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we have positive carry and trading profit goes down and the carry goes up the number the absolute numbers the same operator your next question comes from erika najarian with bank of america jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi erika erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi hi good morning my first question is on the outlook for card losses the net chargeoff rate was certainly eyeopening relative to whats happened in and the discussions actually that ive been having with investors on the trajectory of card is do you think that the bridge that the government built is strong enough that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 we may not see a spike in losses in card like were all expecting and jenn given your comments earlier what would you need to see to feel more comfortable about releasing reserves from your card portfolio jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so its interesting that you brought up the bridge being strong enough it does feel like at this point in this crisis that the bridge has been strong enough the question that still remains is is the bridge long enough and so while we just had recent stimulus passed that makes us feel better about the bridge being long enough but we have to get through the next three to six months so it feels like weve been saying that since this crisis started but i think it is particularly true at this point obviously given the vaccine rollout so consumer confidence is still low relative to precovid levels you can compare that to the wholesale side where ceo confidence is up thats not true on the consumer side and so the next three to six months is going to be critically important for us to assess whether not only is it strong enough but is it long enough and do we see consumer sentiment pick up a bit theres also possibility for payment chops as some relief programs whether it be student loan forbearance or taxes owed on benefits received there are things that could hit the consumer in the next three to six months that we need to think about jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i would just add very different for subprime and prime and if you look at our portfolio its mostly prime and the folks in the prime category have a lot more income a lot more savings housing prices were up they did not lose their jobs so the news there is actually rather good on the lower quartiles its the opposite even now we just did all the stimulus checks and we did about million of them which have already been processed jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co billion jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co million for billion approximately and that the bottom the folks who had in their accounts or the accounts were coming down and they just got they obviously need it the folks in the higher end they obviously dont need it quite as much so we expect it to go up but its possible somehow it doesnt happen in some dramatic way erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and jamie my second question is for you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i make another point very important jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yes jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we do not consider taking down reserves recurring or no income we dont do it to show a profit we dont consider it a profit its ink on paper its based on lots of different calculations obviously we want real losses to be low over time but just if our card reserve is like billion we took it down next quarter because we had more optimistic outlook were not going to sitting here cheering about that were cheering that americas doing better but we dont consider that earnings and i think you all should look at it a little bit differently now particularly with the change in accounting rules erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc yeah i think your investors appreciate that and the second question i had for you jamie is on last years investor day it was clear to your investor base that you were looking to inorganically enhance your scale in awm and whats interesting is that the discussion that ive been having with your investors more recently is them wondering whether or not you would consider a larger deal maybe in payments given that a lot of investors and banks are thinking that thats the part that seems to be potentially more vulnerable to technology competitors what are your thoughts there and i guess my own thought process has been tempered by jennifers presentation on capital but wanted to get your thoughts there jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we have our capital cup runneth over we have so much capital we cannot use it if you look at what happened this year our capital went from to but i think advanced is more representative of real risk so it would be thats after doing trillion of loans billion of reserves billion of dividend i mean were earning if you look at pretax preprovision billion or billion a year so were in very good shape to invest the most important thing in these management meetings is that we grow every business organically every single one opening branches adding accounts doing payments and we put a lot of time and effort into payments were quite good at it between credit card debit card chase merchant services but i agree with you and were open for inorganic too inorganic shouldnt be an excuse not for growing organically and its not just asset management it would be any area where we could do i thought cxloyalty was a neat thing instamed was a neat thing we bought 55ip which is a special way to manage money tax efficiently and so were going to build it ourselves or buy it were open minded anyone of you have good ideas for us let us know we have the wherewithal but we will also look at buying it like i said were always looking for a way to invest more of our money intelligently weve got a tremendous set of assets we also have a tremendous set of competitors particularly in payments consumer land now and a bunch of other areas so you saw google pay you saw walmarts going to try to spend a bit of a long time in expanding in we like competition we believe in it but we have to be really prepared for that and that is deeply on our mind in how we run our business operator your next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jamie a question on cxloyalty because i thought your loyalty program and capability set there in your payments space and your consumerfacing space was quite good so im just wondering what the rationale was and is there an expectation that youre going to be leveraging that into noncard portions of your business was that part of the so what was this deal jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so betsy ill take that one so were really excited about this one and really with any tech platform scale matters so combining our scale with cxloyaltys innovative technology will be a win not only for our chase customers but for cxloyaltys existing clients and suppliers and then youre right to point out our existing ur platform but that today is predominantly used as a points redemption portal so theres a huge opportunity to capture a greater share of our customer spend on travel which is billion both on and off us so in addition to capturing the full economic value of the existing redemptions on the platform we also have an opportunity to really turn it into a great place for our customers to book travel betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay but still focused on the card space as opposed to moving into other parts of your relationship with consumers jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its consumer just think of it as consumer jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co theres no reason it has to be card only jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jenn mentioned a number like more than of travel expense goes through our cards something like that and so we want to give a far better experience to our own customers when it comes to what we offer them through travel youre right ultimate rewards always does a good job but why wouldnt you try to double that over time or triple it jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and we think we can do a better job for their existing clients and suppliers so it wont just be about chase customers jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co exactly betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then the followup question just on the technology budget increasing i mean i know this comes after a year of being somewhat stable yearonyear and just wanted to dig into the comment that you made on the page around data analytics cybersecurity and artificial intelligence capabilities again youve been a leader in this for a while so the question is wheres the white space that youre moving into and can you give us a sense as to how important this is for some of the expansion that youre doing geographically in uk digital and some of the european footprint that youre expanding into jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so first of all cyber were going to do we have to do whatever it takes and we are going to do that in everything we do but you mentioned we built brandnew data centers pretty much around the world which are a lot more efficient theyre going to be effectively theyre not cloud based but they have all the cloud technology et cetera for our own private cloud were moving other stuff to the public cloud were refactoring applications to get there were redoing all the data you all know the issue with the data not that banks were bad but data was held in all these different accounts youre trying to build these data links you can use ai and machine learning better and all in due haste the cloud is real the cost is real the speed is real the security is real the ai is real the machine learning is real so every single business almost every single meeting we go through is talking about what are we moving to the cloud whether its internal or external what are we adding ai and machine learning and are we getting the data analytics right and it is global and we dont spend that much time on it but every single business is doing it you have a tremendous amount of ai being used in asset wealth management cib in trading in commercial banking prospecting and its literally the tip of the iceberg whatever we say today years from now it will be probably times more than were doing today and i would spend anything to get it done faster operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning a question on capital return and capital usage in the deck and in your press release you mentioned that youre looking to get back into more return of capital you mentioned billion net and theres still the net income test and i just wanted to ask you to kind of walk us through how you think about how do you think about full usage of that billion and then how do you think forward visàvis the comments we just talked about with regards to potential external opportunities and whats the best use of that incremental capital given that you still have a healthy amount sitting there jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so we always start in the same place which is we would much prefer to do the things that jamies been talking about than to buy back our stock so we would much prefer to deploy it to organic growth or acquisitions having said that we do as you point out have significant excess capital at this point when we look at the first quarter the fed capacity was defined by the trailing four quarters of profits and so when you back out our dividend thats where you get to the billion so that is the capacity that we have for this quarter and well do up to that amount obviously i dont know that well do the full amount but well certainly do obviously cant do more than billion and then were certainly hopeful that we can go back to bau under the scb framework beyond the first quarter as we think about buybacks but well wait to see what the fed says at the end of the first quarter ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we need to manage our capital down to the or whatever we set in that regards to having getting permission from the fed theyve already implied thats what theyre going to do thats the way it should be done eventually one day jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah understood jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the only other thing i want to point out is that weve been consistent at times tangible book with our earnings power and dividend and all stuff like that it still makes sense to buy back stock but that diminishes every point and or wed much rather use our capital to grow organically or inorganically jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean well always look at the effective return of us buying back our stock for our remaining shareholders and if we think it makes sense relative to the alternative were going to keep doing it ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah consistent with what youve said in the past thanks and just a question on the card business you mentioned how much of that spend goes through chase and just given that we still have some uncertainties with jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 regards to a true return to open your card segment revenue yield actually did improve a little bit just wondering if you can kind of help us just think through the pushes and pulls you see on the card business with regards to your expectations of spend improving balances improving and competition underneath thanks jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so the competition remains very very strong as it relates to the revenue yield theres a little bit of noise there because balances are down so much and thats what thats derived from so theres a little bit of noise there importantly we do if gdp is back to levels by the middle of the year we expect spend to continue to recover and perhaps significantly so in the second half as it relates to travel whether its the second half of or we are confident that our customers will continue to travel and theres pentup demand im sure for travel and so we are excited about those opportunities whether they come in or or beyond jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and we take very seriously the new entrants like the goldman sachs card and there are a bunch of other folks who are doing similar things and we expect to see more of that operator your next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there thank you so i think its good time of the year to get your marktomarket on your thoughts on the competitive landscape and i know every business is competitive but im more curious on the new side of competitive and maybe im talking more about the consumer and commercial banking right now but between all the neo banks that either want to pay much more than you guys on deposits or charge no fees or the buy now pay later models or things where you also even play in bankingasaservice in trying to provide banking products to big technology companies with big client footprints im most curious to see is this just normal evolution and not changing things or is this something bigger going on here that you want to comment on thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so im going to in the commercial bank theres probably less than you think i do think there are alternative credit providers but we also do a lot of things for our clients indiscernible investment banking fx swaps cash management custody asset management et cetera so its slightly different i think on the consumer side we wrote in the chairmans letter years ago that silicon valley is coming and i think its just more and faster and better and quicker and we have to just be very conscious about it it includes pay now pay later and we have some of those product ourselves but our job is to make sure we use our unbelievable strength and client base and capability and as gordon always points out when you have that kind of product set you got to also keep it simple clear basic what the customer wants just to deliver it more and better and so were quite conscious jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 and i would also add by the way its not just that the team looks at ant financial and alipay and all these other competitors i expect one day youll see other big foreign banks back here again including the big chinese banks the biggest ones who are bigger than us and i mean that may be or years out but we better be thinking or years out and so theyre all coming were comfortable but were still exercising and taking our vitamins okay jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and its another reason our investments are going up as much as they are because were very well aware of it glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi fair enough keep taking those vitamins maybe along the same lines i think youve spoken about the power that the data of your own client footprint and franchises have and im just curious we havent heard that much lately about what youre collecting how you can use it how you can use it to enhance the customer experience accelerate growth you have all this at your fingertips and people talk about data as being the new gold im curious on how youre thinking about it right now jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes yes and yes thats all were going to tell you i mean ive talked about how important ai is obviously data and ai the ai and data directly related and some of it gets used very well but if you sat down some of it doesnt get used well we have restrictions far more restrictions than some of our silicon valley competitors but still there are ways to use our data to do a better job for our clients and we do a tremendous amount already in marketing risk fraud cyber you name it and we use a lot of that like a lot of that stuff also protects our clients in cyber operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi ill ask my question and then go back in the queue just i guess i missed your investor day we have four slides to talk about that i guess if your capital cup is runneth over maybe your expense budget could runneth over too i mean spending is certain returns are uncertain so it seems like theres more questions this year than in the past you did get positive operating leverage last year during the pandemic so yes youve earned the right to go ahead and spend more i think most people would agree but theres still just so many questions so ill just ask on ccb it looks like slide you mentioned going to all states by mid2021 i didnt really get all of that so how many states have you been in and by the time you get to how much spending is that whats the game plan whats your plan with branches others are shutting branches after the pandemic youre expanding if you could just give some color on that or if gordons on the call we can hear from him too jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 gordons not so we started this a while back to expand the branches and stuff like that and were still were closing plenty of branches so if you look at what were doing i forgot the number but weve closed like a thousand in the last four or five years and weve opened like a thousand or something like that and i think when we did the bank onejpmorgan deal we were in states states and when we started the expansion originally were very conscious that the world needs less branches and the shape of the branch is differently and we made hub and spoke and were always testing new things and stuff like that but we still have almost a million people a day who visit branches and thats down but theres million people a day i forgot the number its or of accounts are still opened in branches small businesses still need branches and the new branches that we opened in boston philadelphia dc theyve been doing quite well and the shocking thing is its doing quite well in card consumer investments small business so as we go to all the other states we just want to be and we know we have to have a certain size were not going in each state with one just to plant the flag that would be kind of a waste of time we look at the major markets remember people already know us through chase and stuff like that and so were optimistic that this strategy will pay off and it will enhance our businesses our capabilities and other things im not going to tell you because its very competitive i think weve shared too much with our competitors in the past so im going to kind of shut myself up a little bit jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co but mike i can just add a little bit of color on the numbers so we had said that we were going to open up new branches in market expansion so we have done so far importantly in we did fewer than and in were going to do and so of course we by or thats going to start to sunset so there are in the numbers multiyear investments that theyre ramping maybe in but they will ramp down now that will obviously give us capacity to reinvest those dollars but we have a lot of capacity within the numbers you see on the page to continue to increase investments without necessarily the absolute number going up in tech as an example or of that number in any given year is completed so that gives us more dollars to reinvest and then the only other thing i would add on branches is just like the franchise value that comes with opening up these branches in new states is extraordinary and i think underestimated because it gives us the ability to do state and municipal business that we wouldnt have otherwise been able to do so its not just about consumer banking jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and it gives me a chance to in north dakota which is the only state ive never been in believe it or not we always do a lot of middle market and credit card and mortgage in north dakota we just didnt do consumer banking so i do the second when im allowed im on my way to like bismarck or fargo or something like that the new head of investor relations who is sitting in this room right now reggie chambers who im sure youll all get to know this was part of what he did for the sun belt which is all the branch expansion though theyll restrict him how much he can tell you but and including looking at different formats were not blind to the nature that you have the worlds changing and digital and all that and we can very quickly just so you know i forgot the number change the fleet like if you said god the worlds changing more rapidly were completely comfortable that in a fiveyear period we can dramatically reduce the size of the fleet or the cost of the fleet et cetera while serving clients jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so just kind of like what you did with commercial bank from a few years back going to every state i guess but so states where were you say a year ago or three years ago just to give final context to that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co twentyeight states three years ago and by the way commercial banks same thing we talked about expansion so when we bought wamu it took years but we said we were going to do billion in the wamu states which is mostly california florida atlanta something like that but were very close to hitting that indiscernible million this year or something like that i told the teams we reviewed it yesterday that when we hit billion i want to send a case of really expensive wine to a guy called steve walker who did it for us and hired great bankers great capabilities stuff like that we were doing million of investment banking business when we did the bank one deal jpmorgan through the commercial bank we set a target of billion then billion then billion we exceeded billion i think we did billion the new target is billion its now to of domestic us investment banking particularly dcm ecm ma through that network and the investment bank the commercial banking expanded into healthcare technology and we have a couple other areas were going to be rolling out soon so these expansions really make sense they pay for themselves theyre relentless theyre hard to do theyre all hard to do right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay ill requeue jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and remember the commercial bank generally needs branches its very hard to and weve done it but its very hard to build the quality of business without a retail branch system when youre a commercial bank like you will see very few commercial banks that dont have retail branches operator your next question comes from the line of brian kleinhanzl with kbw jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi brian brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 hey morning just a quick question on the expense outlook i noticed there was a small piece in there related to the workforce optimization but i guess thinking in the broader context as we get through covid19 and move to the post covid19 world the general thought process was that there would be this big expensesave opportunity coming from that workfromhome environment but it doesnt really show in your expense outlook is that something that you didnt expect to see beyond is this a stepdown expenses jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but in the big picture our people expense is billion our real estate expense is im going to say billion jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so even and i do think we can be much more efficient than that but i dont think its like a game changer jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and we cant move our footprint that quickly anyway so we do have time here to make sure that we do it really thoughtfully jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but jenn is thinking about moving the finance functions to florida jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hawaii yes jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hawaii jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hawaii thats right brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 and then just a followup maybe on the international theres also the billion hopes of additional revenue on the international could you give an update on how thats tracking so far jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sorry i didnt catch that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co a billion what brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc on the international revenue expansion that you were looking for jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well first of all the investment bank is expanding broadly everywhere as best it can and so is asset management and i forget before we spoke about china and stuff like that the commercial bank started international expansion effort to cover companies overseas that we do business with here that we were not covering and its doing fine its mostly expense right now we added bankers and products and services and legal and compliance and weve been adding clients were quite happy with it i should point out that we just had the best year ever in asia i mean i think it was up like or something like that asia is still will be one of the fastest growing markets in the world and thats just kind of countrybycountry make sure we get that right operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi jennifer hi jamie can you guys share with us obviously theres been a change in the administration and the senate and a number of our regulatory body heads are going to be replaced this year including the occ and the consumer protection bureau sic bureau of consumer protection can you guys give us some color what youre thinking about what may change from a regulatory standpoint with the different political party controlling washington now jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah our focus is always the same weve got million us clients weve got investment clients around the world we run this company to serve clients communities hospitals we financed billion in states cities schools hospitals this year thats what we do obviously we want to satisfy all of our regulators so i do expect that therell be a new set of regulators a new set of demands some we agree with we want to do a better job in climate for the world we want to be more green we want to help the disadvantaged more weve all got an jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 enormous amount of programs for racial equality and things like that so yeah but theyll be tougher thats life its life around the world and were going to we have to deal with a whole bunch of new regulators which were trying to satisfy the ecb et cetera and so i dont think its going to change our life that much and competitively everyones in the same kind of boat and so it will be fine and we want the new president to be successful gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then following up jennifer you talked about on page of your slide deck the issue with deposits and the marginal benefit of these deposits and you guys are wrestling with this issue can you share with us and you already have talked about the branch expansion in all states contiguous states how is this going to be managed as best you can over the next to months because obviously longterm you want that branch expansion but simultaneously as you pointed out you may be getting a negative roe if you dont get relief on the slr and is there a chance that you will get that expansion on the slr from the regulators jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so ill start with we certainly remain hopeful that well get the extension importantly as we think about branch expansion nearterm rate headwinds we certainly consider that but at the margin theyre not a factor given the longterm franchise value associated with the branch expansion and the fact that its not just about deposits for any one consumer anyway because we have the opportunity to have a much broader relationship with them and all of that is factored into the branch expansion but we do consider in the analytics there the nearterm headwinds from rates but there is a steady state number which is more of a normalized level of rates so it doesnt at the margin it might change some decisions around marketing but it doesnt have a big impact on us jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and the bigger decisions on that which we have a lot of leeway on is at the investment bank its repo deposits corporate clients trade finance all those other things so this is managed very very closely remember gsifis is just one of im going to say constraints we manage by business by product by area by region by jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and we bring it up obviously it is an issue for us in the near to medium term should we not get the extension and its one thats important for people to understand but we bring it up more so because its just another example of where lack of coherence around these rules can have an impact not just on jpmorgan so we dont bring it up just because of the impact on jpmorgan we bring it up because it is perhaps one of the better examples of the need for recalibration you have to have the right incentives in the system for it to work through time and were just seeing that thats not the case jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co remember we were able to reduce deposits billion in like months last time jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but we dont want to do it its just very customer unfriendly to say please take your deposits elsewhere jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but they do have a lot of these larger corporate clients do have other options in not just deposits but money market funds or something like that so well manage none of this is going to be an issue for folks i mean fundamentally just how we run our company and even if that temporary relief goes away and im always against temporary relief because for this exact reason it creates another cliff even if it goes away were fine we just have to manage it much tighter jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi maybe a bit of a basic question but why is markets revenue or trading so good still not just for you but the overall wallet i get it that the investment banking business the state of businesses are very good theres lots of liquidity banks have lots of capital but of course rates are near zero credit spreads are tight volatility is low so ill take away some of the answers but just conceptually its been very strong it sounds like the hope is that itll remain strong whats really driving that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co theres billion of global financial assets trillion and probably in or years that number is going to be trillion people have to buy and sell to hedge finance move money around the world fx currencies pension plans obviously volumes go up and down spreads generally over time have been coming down which you expect in a competitive market but the expansion of the balance sheets of the central banks around the world so jenn showed you the trillion or trillion in the fed but globally its trillion and companies have a lot of financing to do and of course when you have higher dcm and higher ecm and higher ma that also drives a lot of trading and so youve got to kind of put that all in the mix jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and obviously the question is how sustainable is this and i guess one argument could be that technology has allowed banks to increase the velocity youve been talking about this for some time do you think that is a structural change that will benefit the businesses and specifically for you guys over a longer time period jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah the way to look is we kept our share while things were electronified and digitized and the business has done it kind of the way we expected them to do it so yeah we think scale matters technology matters and hopefully and we think we can even grow our share this is just trench warfare so we expect to grow it but we its very hard to say what the base level is and we thought that the base level kind of bottomed out sometime last year and will it stay as high as it stayed in that i doubt it may not go back to what it was it may be higher than that operator your next question comes from the line of charles peabody with portales jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi charles charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc hi good morning i have a couple of questions related to fintech and unfortunately i was born in the wrong generation i need a lot of help how dependent is the fintech world on the banking system i mean as i understand they lay on top of the pipes and the plumbing of the banking system do you have any leverage in a competitive world against the fintech world and then secondly i noticed that the occ gave banks the green light to use public blockchain networks and stablecoins can you explain what importance that has to jpmorgan jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co do you want to go ahead on the blockchain there jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay sure so that guidance enables an offering of stablecoins on a public blockchain so that doesnt impact jpm coin jpm coin you should think about as the tokenization of our customer deposits so its obviously very early well assess use cases and customer demand but its still too early to see where this goes for us jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and were using blockchain for sharing data with banks already and so were at the forefront of that which is good the other question was about fintech look first of all they are very good competitors and i pointed out to a lot of people paypal is worth billion square is worth billion stripe is worth billion ant financial is down quite a bit now but theyre there theyre strong theyre smart some effectively ride the rails we bank a jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 lot of them we help them accomplish what they want to accomplish and so my view is were going to compete where we need to and we have to look inside about what we could do better or couldve done better and things like that so im confident were going to be able to compete but i think we now are facing a whole generation of newer tougher faster competitors who and if they dont ride the rails of jpmorgan they can ride the rails of someone else so youve seen i told you before everyone is going to be involved in payments some banks are going to white label which makes a fintech competitor white label the bank and then build whatever service they want on top of it and we have to be prepared for that i expect it to be very very tough brutal competition in the next years i expect to win so help me god charles peabody q analyst portales partners llc thanks so do they need the banking system to complete their loop of service or can they work completely outside the bank jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well most of them do for now but i think its a mistake to say its going to be forever theyre getting new bank licenses utah is giving people industrial licenses like i said banks are white labeling so its effectively the same thing if a fintech company uses a white label bank to process their business theyre basically a bank and what the regulators do with that i dont know but we have to assume that theyre going to do it and that some dont need will find ways not to use the banking system which theyve done you look at a whole bunch of other things they do stuff around the banking system which is fine im not against that the regulators may have a point of view with that one day but ill let them worry about that im going to worry about us operator your next question comes from the line of andrew lim with société générale jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi andrew andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible one other point there are examples of unfair competition which we will do something about eventually people who make a lot more on debit because they operate under certain things the only reason they compete is because of that people who basically dont do kycaml and create risk for the system and i could go on and on and on but there are that part we will be a little more aggressive on people who improperly use data thats been given to them like plaid okay so you can expect that there will be other battles that take place here jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi sorry its andrew lim here so i just wanted to pick your brains on inflation obviously inflation metrics are picking up if we look at the rates if we look at inflation indicators and looks like a lot of people are jumping on this inflation bandwagon but i just wanted to see what you are seeing on the ground in the real world as to how this might be manifesting itself either in commercial banking or in investment banking in terms of like demand for products or volatility is that something that you see as a theme developing jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i mean look we dont have that much more insight than you do you do see signs of it in certain commodities and certain products consumer goods and stuff like that its hard to tell if thats supply lines that cant keep up with demand you have longterm trends chinas no longer entering the world that could change inflation when jenn gave you those numbers always use the implied curve i think the best way to think about it is i think this would be a much bigger conversation next year because we have good growth i think itll be a good thing to have good growth in part inflation but that will become part of the conversation how bad whats everybody going to do and things like that this is a risk management thing youve got to build into your mindset that youve got to look at that as being a possibility so i think maybe a year ago people have said its not possible before covid and now because the world has done trillion of qe and something like trillion to trillion of fiscal stimulus youve got to put on that thing a scenario where you have higher inflation and not that would be great thats like goldilocks but like or just so you understand whats the risk of that and how are you going to manage through that its not the worst thing in the world by the way the worst thing in the world is no growth andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk great okay and for my followup question you talked about how you resolved the issue of excess deposits by pricing away about billion of those so im just wondering why you dont do that now or is the quantum of the problem that much bigger jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we dont have to now indiscernible jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah we dont have to it is slightly different in the sense that there was capacity in the system then to absorb it this is an issue for everyone so that could be a challenge you cant make them go away operator your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi just a couple of quick followups one jamie on the topic of payments and competition facebooks libra is back out there getting rebranded as diem and their goal is basically to be a global payment network or at least to jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 create one and im wondering does the occ stablecoin approval do anything for you you already have jpm coin obviously thats internal to your own footprint but im wondering is there any benefit of the occ stablecoin approval and is there anything with regard to the libra competition thats coming that would drive changes that youre making in your own platforms jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i dont think so but i dont think so betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we expect stablecoin and obviously theres talk about central banks having digital currencies and stuff like that their currency is digital and we move it around the world its in central banks theyre all moved by electrons and stuff like that i do expect that stuff is coming and it may not change our world that much but some of these competitors who want to do it they want to be in payments they want the payments data they want to move the money again its going to be a regulatory issue about what that means as long as its not unfair thats the only thing id point as long as we can do the same thing the competition can do then its hard to argue thats unfair jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and betsy i mentioned earlier you might have missed it but it does not impact jpm coin jpm coin is different you should think about that as us tokenizing deposits to make payments easier for clients jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co stable betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right yeah no yeah no i totally get that i was just thinking hey if the occ is allowing stablecoin maybe theyre trying to help move the center of the stack into the banking system that was kind of a question the followup was just on back to slide in the other purple area where the nontechnology expenses are moving up yearonyear and part of that is the billion commitment to the path forward initiative and jamie i wanted to understand like how youre thinking about that billion what kind of timeframe is that over and where that money is going i mean we put a note out as you know this past quarter on housing and on housing inequality and wondering how youre thinking about how youre going to be investing that billion and the kind of output that you want from it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co right so we believe that inequality is a real problem and the people dont always know but like of americans make an hour or less which is a year or something like that million dont have jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 unemployment and people at the lower end are dying quicker than they died before so for the first time in our lifetimes our grandparents lifetimes americans our mortality is getting worse not better and society has to fix these problems now we need healthy growth healthy growth is good but you also need education and infrastructure healthcare and affordability the racial problem has been around for hundreds of years and with all the things that took place even after the civil rights we havent made the progress that we should be making so we and fortunately lots of other people and companies take this really seriously how can we help all of the american citizens but in particular the black community whos been left behind for so long so our effort is five years the billion includes ive got the exact numbers we published billion of mortgages in lower and middleincome neighborhoods black neighborhoods primarily black neighborhoods it includes affordable housing and building affordable housing it includes billions of dollars for entrepreneurs of color it includes financial education we recently went over million secured cards which is what we expected to do these are cards that have all the benefits of banking atm and online bill pay for a month for lower paid individuals were doing more and more education of those branches were opening or more will be in lmi neighborhoods were financing mbis and cvfis so its a serious effort it costs hundreds of millions of dollars a year there are hundreds of people involved here so we have it down to how many loan officers were going to put in this neighborhood and how many loan officers were going to put in that neighborhood and were going to report it out to you were not going to were going to tell you where it worked and where it didnt work we dont mind things not working well just change course and stuff like that and obviously it includes hiring more from the black community and training here and stuff like that so i think these efforts my own view is that the corporate world has to do this if you want to fix it its not going to happen we need good government but its not going to happen just with good government the jobs are at the local level unemployment in south bronx is and still high the kids didnt have computers to go home and do their zooming and their schools didnt have it and then fortunately a lot of philanthropies including my wife sent a lot of computers to people there but we have to do something about this were all worse off for it and my view is we should do it for moral purposes alone that would be sufficient but for commercial purposes do it if all parts of america are doing better youll have better outcomes and more jobs and healthier people and less crime and less prisons and less drugs and so its time to get our act together and again i think business has to work in collaboration with government to do it i just dont think it can happen alone and its not going to happen just by yelling at people the successful companies did not create the slums but they can help fix them operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just following up more on the market expansion in commercial banking could you just drill down deeper on the international part of that expansion and whats left to be done in the us jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well i think ill answer the us but i think the us again were only going to share so much information from now on but its the same thing we looked at all the major smsas or the middle market companies were doing deep dives into how many there are and i think were now in of the top roughly so that expansion is now jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 just going deeper not maybe more at this point theyll be helped a little bit by the retail expansion i think overseas i just dont remember the number offhand jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i dont either jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay but youre talking about that will eventually cover and i could be dead wrong on this more clients overseas these are headquarters or subsidiaries of foreign companies that we probably do business with headquarter subsidiaries in the us and we can share more of this view later down the road jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and i would just jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and tell charlie he cant imitate me on this one jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co mike i would just add just from an expense perspective its important to remember on the international front that were riding existing rails that are already there in cib so this is an extraordinary opportunity to hire bankers and we already have the infrastructure jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and we usually generally bank with the us subsidiary jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats right jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co or the us headquarters jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so its not the lift you might think from an expense perspective mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 okay and then just a followup on the other questions that have been asked related to fintech jamie you said youre going to win right but based on the valuations of the paypals and stripes and visa and mastercard anything thats fintechrelated i mean they trounce the valuation of your stock so i think the markets saying that others are going to win so how is jpmorgan going to i mean you said silicon valley is coming what that was like six years ago or something and then each year we say yeah we missed it we missed it we missed it well if so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no mike we never said we missed it weve been doing fine those last five years so it isnt like but i do agree with you i gave that to the management team my whole operating committee a little deck that showed visa billion mastercard billion paypal billion ant financial billion tencent billion alibaba trillion facebook google apple amazon you can go on and on but absolutely we should be scared indiscernible about that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so how are you going to win i mean just like what jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co im not going to tell you but we have plenty of resources a lot of very smart people we just got to get quicker better faster which we do weve done an exceptional job if you look at what weve done youd say youve done a good job but the other people have done a good job too some of them have monopolies virtually so its a whole different issue but operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi just one followup obviously jennifer you pointed out that your mortgage production revenue was quite healthy in the quarter and youve penetrated the correspondent channel can you guys share with us on the servicing side with the new with the forbearance programs that the governments put into place is that a positive or a negative for servicing revenue as we go forward jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co oh gosh jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jenn will answer that one jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 yeah i dont even know exactly how to answer it gerard all i can say is that when we give customers the help that they need if thats what bridges them to the other side of this thing for sure its good so i dont know precisely what the math is but theres no doubt its good if it helps get our customers to the other side i mean to service their mortgage gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc in the past when loans go into delinquency obviously and theres in a mortgagebacked security obviously you guys have to advance the funds and stuff but the deferred loans are not in that im assuming theyre not in that category is that correct jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co not yet gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and youre absolutely right the cost of servicing a defaulted loan is like times the cost of servicing a non defaulted loan so jenn is right as long as they dont permanently default its probably a small benefit gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i got you youre talking about advancing the servicing cost got it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thats not an issue either by the way jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you appreciate it jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 15jan2021 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan
