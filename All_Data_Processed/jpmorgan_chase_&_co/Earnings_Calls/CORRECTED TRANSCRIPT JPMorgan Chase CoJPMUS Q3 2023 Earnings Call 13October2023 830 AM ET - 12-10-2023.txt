management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases third quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chief financial officer jeremy barnum and their chairman and ceo jamie dimon mr dimon please go ahead james dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co good morning everybody before we start the actual call i want to repeat something we just said on the press call so before we get into the discussions about third quarter earnings i just want to say how deeply saddened we all are about the recent horrific attacks on israel and the resulting bloodshed and more terrorism and hatred have no place in our civilized world and all the hearts at jpmorgan chase go out to all who are suffering jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks jamie and of course i very much echo the sentiment now lets turn to our third quarter earnings results the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of these results included million of net investment securities losses in corporate and million of firmwide legal expense on page we have some more detail similar to last quarter we have called out the impact of first republic where relevant for this quarter first republic contributed billion of revenue million of expense and billion of net income now focusing on the firmwide results excluding first republic revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear nii ex markets was up billion or driven by higher rates and higher revolving balances in card partially offset by lower deposit balances nir ex markets was up million or which included lower net investment securities losses than the prior year and markets revenue was down million or yearon year expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear primarily driven by ongoing growth in front office and technology staffing as well as wage inflation and higher legal expense and credit costs were billion predominantly driven by net chargeoffs in card and included a million net reserve release driven by changes in the central scenario primarily offset by card loan growth on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up about basis points versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less capital distributions was partially offset by aoci we had billion of net share repurchases this quarter and the pace of buybacks will likely remain modest in light of the basel iii endgame proposal in line with our capital hierarchy we will continue to reassess the buyback trajectory as circumstances evolve or opportunities emerge and on the topic of the basel iii endgame youll see that we added a couple of pages on it so lets cover that now starting on page given the significance of this proposal for us the broader industry as well as households and businesses as endusers we thought it was important to spend time discussing it and while we know theres interest in having us quantify the expected impact of this proposal in a lot of granular detail its important to start by asking why the proposed increase is so large given the repeated statement over time by policymakers that banks are wellcapitalized and wellpositioned to deal with stress given that context the absence of detailed analysis supporting a capital increase of this magnitude is disconcerting and theres a lot that does not make sense to us starting with rwa weve already said we expect the firms rwa to increase by around or billion which results in capital requirements increasing by about or billion one immediate thing to point out is that at gsib a billion increase in rwa requires billion of additional capital with no change in our systemic risk footprint weve been on the record for a long time the gsib was conceptually flawed and miscalibrated originally since implementation the failure to address economic growth despite the fed themselves acknowledging this problem at the outset has made matters worse and now all of those problems are being applied to an additional billion of rwa our view is that the combined proposals could have adjusted the surcharge levels to keep dollars of capital associated with gsib buffer constant rather than simply multiplying the rwa increase by the existing surcharges another lense on the proposed increases is the introduction of rwa for operational risk and its clear overlap with op risk losses already capitalized through the stress capital buffer although theres limited disclosure from the fed on this point we have estimated that we have about billion of operational risk capital embedded in the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 scb based on the information the fed does disclose once we capitalize with this new op risk rwa our required capital will go up by around billion without any change to our portfolio now lets turn to page which shows the impact of the actual and proposed capital rules over the last few years zooming out from the details of this most recent proposal this page reminds us of whats happened since since then saccr and the stress capital buffer have been adopted and our gsib surcharge will increase to so assuming the basel iii endgame and gsib proposals are finalized in their current form we would see a increase in our capital requirements relative to that starting point this illustrates again how over calibrated these proposals are and its not done yet we still expect the fed to incorporate cecl into ccar which will likely increase the scb and of course given the absence of a fix to the gsib flaws it continues to present a headwind into the indefinite future and aside from those dynamics there remains the longstanding issue of procyclicality in the overall capital framework we think its also important to point out that the agencies did actually have a choice here while it may technically be true that the proposal is basel compliant basel compliance does not mandate a increase in capital requirements implementing the basel iii endgame consistently with how the europeans have by retaining credit risk modeling and also addressing the compounding effects of gsib and scb would have achieved basel compliance without creating this unnecessary increase in capital requirements as you would expect we will continue to engage and forcefully advocate during the comment period and beyond in a great deal of technical detail for the purposes of this call we wanted to make the equally important broader points about both the level of capital increase and the flaws in the construct of the framework itself since coherent design is critical to the frameworks durability over time the current proposal exacerbates existing features that discourage beneficial scale and diversification if it goes through as written there will likely be significant impacts on pricing and availability of credit for businesses and consumers in addition the ongoing and persistent increase in the regulatory cost of market making for banks suggests that the regulators want dramatic changes of the current operation of the us capital markets we believe that well regulated market makers that are committed to deploying capital to clients on a principal basis are a critical building block supporting the breadth depth and resilience of the american capital markets which is vital to the us economy so caution is warranted when proposing changes of this magnitude with that lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page consumer spend growth has now reverted to prepandemic trends with nominal spend per customer stable and relatively flat yearonyear cash buffers continued to normalize to prepandemic levels with lowerincome groups normalizing faster turning now to the financial results excluding first republic ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear in banking wealth management revenue was up yearon year driven by higher nii on higher rates endofperiod deposits were down quarteronquarter we ranked number one in retail deposit share based on fdic data and continued to solidify our leadership position in key markets client investment assets were up yearonyear driven by market performance and strong net inflows as we continue to capture yieldseeking flows from our consumer banking customers in home lending revenue was down yearonyear given a smaller market originations of billion were up slightly quarteronquarter but they remain down yearonyear moving to card services auto revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up yearonyear due jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 to strong account acquisition continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were billion up yearonyear as we saw competitors pull back and we gained market share expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by continued investments in staffing primarily in front office and technology in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion driven by net chargeoffs which were up million yearonyear predominantly due to continued normalization in card the net reserve build of million reflected a million build in card services primarily offset by a million release in home lending next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was down yearonyear ib fees were down yearonyear and we ranked number one with a yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were down underwriting fees were up for debt and down for equity in terms of the outlook were encouraged by the level of capital markets activity in september and we have a healthy pipeline going into the fourth quarter advisory has also picked up compared to the first half but yearto date announced ma remains down significantly which will continue to be a headwind payments revenue was billion up yearonyear excluding equity investments it was up driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances moving to markets total revenue was billion down yearonyear against a very strong third quarter last year fixed income was up driven by an increase in financing and trading activity in securitized products as well as improved performance in credit this was predominantly offset by currencies and emerging markets coming off a very strong quarter last year equity markets was down reflecting lower revenues across products compared to a strong prioryear quarter as activity was challenged by lower volatility securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher legal expense and wage inflation credit costs were net benefit of million driven by a net reserve release of million reflecting the impact of net lending activity and net chargeoffs of million moving to the commercial bank on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear with payments revenue of billion up yearonyear driven by higher rates and gross investment banking and markets revenue of million was up yearonyear reflecting increased ma volume expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by an increase in head count including front office and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense including the impact of new client acquisition average deposits were down yearonyear quarteronquarter primarily driven by lower non operating deposits as clients opt for higher yielding alternatives loans were up quarteronquarter ci loans were flat reflecting continued stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization and cre loans were up reflecting funding of prior year originations in real estate banking as well as lower payoff activity finally credit costs were million including net chargeoffs of million and a net reserve build of million jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of revenue of billion was relatively flat yearonyear as higher management fees on strong net inflows and higher average market levels were offset by lower performance fees and lower nii from deposits expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by continued growth in our private banking advisor teams and the impact of closing the jp morgan asset management china and global shares acquisitions for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion positive across all asset classes led by equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion aum of trillion was up yearonyear and client assets of trillion were up yearonyear driven by continued net inflows of higher market levels finally loans were flat quarteronquarter while deposits were down driven by migration to investments partially offset by client inflows turning to corporate on page corporate reported net income of million revenue was billion up billion compared to last year nii was billion up billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates and nir was a net loss of million and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned upfront expenses of million were up million yearonyear to finish we have the outlook on page we now expect nii and nii ex markets to be approximately billion and billion respectively with the increase driven by slower reprice than previously assumed consistent with what weve been saying throughout the year while we dont know when it will normalize we do not consider this level of nii to be sustainable our outlook for adjusted expense is now approximately billion and as a reminder this is on an adjusted basis which excludes legal expense also remember this outlook excludes the pending fdic special assessment and on credit we now expect the card net chargeoff rate to be approximately mostly driven by denominator effects due to recent balance growth so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating results throughout the year weve been pointing out the various sources of significant uncertainty in all of those including the geopolitical situation economic outlook rate environment deposit reprice and the impact of the basel iii endgame proposal are as prominent now as they have been in the recent past but as always we continue to prepare for a range of scenarios and are focused on being there for our clients and customers when they need us most and with that lets open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you please stand by our first question comes from john mcdonald with autonomous research you may proceed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp hi good morning jeremy i was wondering if you could give us a little more color in what youre seeing so far on deposit reprice and migration whats been better than expected so far on that front and how do you see higher forlonger rates potentially impacting deposit reprice pressure jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure thanks john i think the themes are pretty much the same as weve seen in prior quarters so as we talked a little bit about on the press call weve been trying to be a little bit cautious about recognizing that we dont think the current levels are sustainable and we do think that well have to reprice in some pockets to some degree maybe tiering or whatever at some point in the future and of course that hasnt happened yet this year so thats one factor in the meantime the cd strategy is working well were getting continue to get very good feedback from the field and were capturing money in motion and so were seeing the sort of internal migration and the associated slow increase in deposit rate paid as a result of cd migration but thats sort of working as we would have hoped and so everything is kind of playing out according to plan i would say in terms of higherforlonger i think it just means that there will continue to be upward pressure on deposit pricing both from internal migration and possibly moderate effects and in the end as we always say were going to price products as a function of the competitive market environment john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp and just as a follow up it seems like youve done some securities repositioning the last couple quarters how are you positioning the balance sheet in terms of cash and the securities portfolio given your outlook for rates jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i think i would say that while were not predicting higher rates i dont know if jamie will have something to say here we believe in being prepared for it and thats been our position for some time and of course thats produced good results and we continue to try to position ourselves so that neither have significantly higher rates nor significant lower rates present a particularly large challenge to the company so probably at the margin were still a little bit biased for slightly higher rates but do keep in mind that when modeling the duration of the balance sheet higher rates do extend the duration or rather shorten the duration on the deposit side so that can be a factor as well jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research us lp okay thanks operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research you may proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi jeremy i was hoping to just inquire about the capital markets outlook you cited improved activity levels in september but given persistently higher rates geopolitical tensions and just poor performance of recent ipos how are you thinking about the outlook over the near to medium term and how are you thinking about just the timing of an inflection activity jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question i mean as you know obviously the current levels in investment banking remain quite depressed certainly relative to the elevated levels we saw during the pandemic but even relative to sort of which is what you might consider the last normal year we do eventually think well recover to those levels and hopefully recover to above those levels recognizing by the time it happens you will have had many years of economic growth in the meantime and to be fair while the current environment is a little bit complicated and mixed and there are some headwinds as you pointed out things have improved a little bit and i think i would say our banking team is a little bit more optimistic than they were last quarter so it feels to me like a little bit of a slow grind with some positive momentum but obviously significant uncertainty in the outlook and some structural headwinds given lower levels of announced ma and some regulatory headwinds on that side steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for the color just for my follow up on some of the regulatory commentary you provided certainly a lot of helpful color in the slides so thank you for that if the proposal were to go through as written what proportion of the inflation do you believe can be mitigated over time and was also hoping you could provide some context as to the quantum of how you think cecl inclusion could potentially impact the scb and ccar jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah those are all good questions steve i think its probably too early to try to provide that level of quantification on either front if i start first with the basel iii endgame proposal from our perspective were currently focused on advocating as aggressively as possible for the necessary changes some of which are what jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 you might call philosophical in nature or some of the things i highlighted in my prepared remarks but some of them are sort of very technical in nature including things that we think might actually be mistakes in the proposal and so talking a lot about optimizing away stuff that might change just feels like a bit premature at this point i would point out that given how significant operational risk rwa is as part of the proposal that is you can think of that sort of as a generic tax across the entire spectrum and is therefore in some sense nonoptimizable so we feel that its important to manage expectations about the level of optimization thats possible once the rule is finalized and hopefully some of the technical items are addressed also it depends on your definition of optimization sometimes i use the term costless optimization whereas these technical fixes that dont affect revenue and dont require you to exit businesses i think that type of optimization will be harder to find than it has been in the past but as we pointed out we may simply need to exit things and that will be because it is better than the alternative which would be to do activity thats shareholder value destructive but it wont be costless a good example of that is the renewable energy tax credit investment business which as a result of the quadrupling of the risk weight may no longer make sense now thats one that we hope will be changed but its tricky because those are very long duration assets so between now and the rule is finalized it raises some questions about whether we want to put that stuff on the balance sheet so sorry a bit of a long answer but then yeah on quantifying cecl and ccar i think we better wait for that one because given the relative lack of transparency that we have into the feds exact modeling in terms of which quarter is the peak and so on and so forth its a little bit hard to predict what the exact impact of putting cecl and ccar is going to be we just know probabilistically that it will like everything else these days tend to push capital higher steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color jeremy thanks for taking my question jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just first question jeremy on credit i think you mentioned some of the reserves release was tied to the change in the central scenario so just talk to us and remind us what the central scenario is today what changed and then in terms of fundamentally on credit like where are you seeing softness either on the consumer or the commercial side jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so on the central scenario you should read the research that gets put out by our competitors and our excellent research team no but in all seriousness i think our us economists had their central case outlook to include a very mild recession with i think two quarters of negative of gdp growth in the fourth quarter and jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 first quarter of this year and that then got revised out early this quarter to now have sort of modest growth i think around for a few quarters into so just flowing that through our process while acknowledging that were still skewed to the downside were still reserved to a significantly higher unemployment rate on a weighted average basis than is in the central case outlook so that number weve sometimes given you is this quarter so its really not much more complicated than that were just kind of following the process and i think your other question was where am i seeing softness in credit and i think the answer to that is actually nowhere roughly or certainly nowhere thats not expected meaning we continue to see the normalization story play out in consumer more or less exactly as expected and then of course we are seeing a trickle of charge offs coming through the office space you see that in the chargeoff number for the commercial bank but the numbers are very small and more or less just the realization of the allowance that weve already built there ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and just going back to the details you laid out on basel endgame maybe on the philosophical side i think jamie was speaking last month said that we dont expect any changes but at the same time you make everything that makes sense in terms of the pushback is it all falling on deaf ears from a shareholder perspective are we resigned to the fact that we are going to see more towards the worstcase outcome play out or is there some level of sort of meeting in the middle of the road as this thing gets finalized jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so ill let jamie speak for himself on that point but our job is to advocate were not going to guess what the sentiment is in washington its a thousandpage rule proposal as you know weve got the big team of very smart people studying it very closely interestingly we noted recently that in some of the analysis that they did about the impact on lending they sort of forgot about like billion of the fed in their preamble they forgot about billion sic trillion of operational risk rwa so it just highlights that there is the possibility or seemed to have forgotten they simply omitted the impact of the operational risk rwa on fees so anyway the point is its long its complicated its technical we do think there are probably some technical mistakes in there were not going to forcefully advocate on all of those and while we disagree with a lot of this stuff these are technical issues that should be in some sense resolved technically and hopefully theyll listen ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sorry im just getting a correction in the room i meant to say trillion indiscernible ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah no i got that i got the trillion dollars yes thanks jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co is that what we were talking about actually jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co bpi put something out on it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc bpi did yes thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ryan kenny with morgan stanley you may proceed ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc want to dig in on the nii side so you raised the nii ex markets guidance by billion for this year so i know your comments in the press release suggest jpmorgans overearning so i just want to triangulate there what does normalized nii look like and do we get to normalize next year or later on jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah a couple things so let me do the timing question first so were being very clear that we are not predicting when when is going to be a function of the marketplace and the rate environment and competitive dynamics and so on and so forth so were just really just trying to remind everyone not bank on the current run rates which we just dont fundamentally think are sustainable youll be aware that before investor day earlier this year we tried to quantify what we thought that kind of normalized range might look like and we put a sort of midtype number out there and at investor day we talked about how the acquisition of first republic was going to push that number up a little bit although there was some overlap and so on and so forth so anyway with the benefit of time and having everything settled in a little bit if you sort of push us for that kind of what is that number now look like we think its probably closer to about jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 billion with all the obvious caveats that this is a guess and we dont know when but were just trying to point out that its quite a bit lower than the current run rate ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co inside the company some people think itll happen sooner ie me some people think itll happen later ie jenn and marianne and jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i wasnt aware that i was in that camp actually james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oh okay jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co but i dont know im not trying to have an opinion over you operator thank you our ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then on the loan growth side industry loan growth has slowed significantly this year what demand are you seeing for loan growth across the different categories and i know it might be too early to talk about next year but directionally how should we think about loan growth given where we are in the cycle and the higher capital requirements coming jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so on loan growth the story is pretty consistent with what weve been saying all year so weve of course seen very robust loan growth in card and thats coming from both spending growth and the normalization in revolving balances as we look forward were still optimistic about that but itll probably be a little bit more muted than it has been during this normalization period in auto weve also seen pretty robust loan growth recently both as a function of sort of slightly more competitive pricing on our side as the industry was a little bit slow to raise rates and so we lost some share previously and thats come back now and generally the supply chain situation is better so thats been supported as we look forward there it should be a little bit more muted jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 and i think generally in wholesale the loan growth story is going to be driven just by the economic environment so depending on what you believe about soft landing mild recession no landing you have slightly lower or slightly higher loan growth but in any case i would expect it to be relatively muted and of course home lending remains fairly constrained both by rates and market conditions but also and i think this is true across the board we will be managing things actively as mentioned in light of basel iii which may not change originations but it will change what we retain ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc you may proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jeremy how are you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jeremy you guys have put up a really strong rotce number of for the quarter and when you dive into your different segments what really jumps out at us is the exfirst republic roe in consumer community banking i know you and jamie have talked about your overearning on credit we get that but in view of all of these fintechs and all of these other nonbank competitors that were all supposed to pick away at everybodys market share you guys have put up great numbers here whats the drivers behind an roe even when you take that credit overearning out whats driving this business profitability at such high levels jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah gerard so id say a couple things there so first its not just credit its also deposit margin right so when we talk about overearning on nii a disproportionate amount of that is coming out of the consumer franchise for all of the reasons that weve talked about but i would also point out sometimes we dont like the word over earning because right now customers are happy and theyre doing cds and the broader answer to your question about why were able to be effectively really comes back to a decade two decade long history of investing for the future and recognizing that theres a holistic value proposition here that includes branches and the app and all of the online services and the entire suite of products and services that is around this enterprise which drives engagement and customer loyalty and were seeing some of the benefits of that now although were not complacent the competition is still there the fintechs are still there and we know we need to continue investing to preserve the value and its also true that the particular circumstances of the current rate and credit environment mean that the earnings are a little bit above normal but that core franchise is extremely robust jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a follow up which ties into your answer on the deposit margin and consumer and your earlier comments you and jamie about the internal debate inside jpmorgan about the migration of rates going higher on the funding side your noninterestbearing deposits i think are around of total deposits which is slightly above the you guys had back in or or prepandemic is this expectation that youre going to see more of the noninterestbearing deposits go into interestbearing or is it just the repricing of interest bearing deposits that have some of your folks inside jpmorgan a little more cautious on that net interest income number jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a good question gerard i think its a little bit bigger picture than that and im not sure i get your questions a good question but im not sure that the reported interestbearing noninterestbearing split is the best lens to look at this through for a couple of reasons so first like between wholesale and retail weve got some amount of noninterestbearing and wholesale thats part of the ecr product so you see some dynamics there that play out and in consumer in a world where savings is paying a relatively lowrate paid to cross checking and savings the migration dynamics are probably not that different right now but then of course even within consumer across both consumers and small businesses youve got slightly different dynamics in terms of how people manage their operating balances so i would tend to zoom out a little bit and see this as a holistic answer thats driven by internal migration from checking savings to cds from ecr to interestbearing and wholesale and then our potential response to the rate environment the competitive environment the overall level of systemwide deposits in terms of product level reprice that may or may not happen in moments in the future gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator thank you our next question comes from erika najarian with ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning jeremy my first question is for you again sort of maybe reasking the question in a different way your new guide for net interest income for this year would imply an exit run rate of billion in the fourth quarter as we think about the dynamics in higherforlonger on one hand your fixed rate assets will continue to reprice on the other you even asked a lot about the deposit dynamics that could continue to creep higher how do we think about those puts and takes as we think about that relative to that exit rate of billion in the fourth quarter jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so erika i think the simple answer to your question is i believe that fourth quarter exit number equates to a billion run rate ex markets and were kind of saying jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co billion jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah isnt that what i meant to say james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co she said billion jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co oh i didnt hear that okay anyway james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we didnt model it that way jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so call it billion run rate on an exit rate basis and were saying that we think something a bit more normal is closer to billion so thats one building block underneath that i think one thing thats interesting actually is that as the percentage of the deposits which are cds increases the sort of balance between internal migration and betas and rate and volume its a little bit less binary and a little bit smoother so when we look at this type of stuff and we model migration balances product level reprice as you get out of that lower zero bound with cd mix world things get a little bit smoother i would say overall so itll be interesting to watch that but its obviously one of the most important things for us as a company right now and we do everything we can to manage it but its also worth remembering that the big picture point is just the client franchise and as weve often said were very focused on primary bank relationships and we didnt lose any of those in the last cycle were not planning to lose any in this cycle and thats what sort of a longterm focus means for us james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and i would just say quantitative tightening in there that will be a large number and we dont exactly know the effect where wholesale consumer as remember also the fed has the rrp program which is also sucking money into fed directly and reducing deposits thats still a trillion too erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 thank you and my second question is on maybe zooming out on the basel iii endgame impacts its clearly complex overly complex and i completely agree with you that it is unnecessary at this point and very backward looking i guess what is not complex is the fact that you generated basis points of cet1 this quarter while your rwas are down and i guess my question here is is that i understand that were in the public advocacy process i hear you loud and clear in terms of how this could have harm in terms of pricing for main street and dislocating the pipes in american capital markets but for jpmorgan does this change your natural return profile of jamie i know you lingered a little bit on when you were at barclays in september but at the end of the day it feels like for the portfolio managers that own jpmorgan through the cycle does basel iii endgame really harm your natural earnings power and returns jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay thats a good question erika i think theres a couple pieces in there so let me take the most important piece first which is the through the cycle target are we keeping that or not in light of the basel iii endgame proposal so short answer is were not going to change that number today but when you look at what weve disclosed about a increase in capital you have to start by acknowledging that that is a major headwind to returns in simple terms you talk about earnings power and returns but theyre two different things right we have to be a little bit pedantic and do numerator and denominator here okay so say the numerator doesnt change if you just dilute down the numerator by the increased capital thats a significantly lower return number i would say that thats probably the lower bound in terms of the impact of the basel iii endgame for a couple reasons one is we are hoping for changes two is once the rule is final we will seek to reprice in the places where we can and thatll be different in consumer and wholesale some of it will be product level some of it will be relationship level but that hopefully can mitigate some of it but of course the flip side of that is thats cost getting passed into the real economy and thats part of the point that weve made about lowering availability of products and services and lending there may be some opportunities for costless optimization im personally a little bit more pessimistic about those but weve surprised ourselves on those points in the past so well see and then finally yeah we may stop doing certain things and we may exit things but i wouldnt necessarily assume that thats going to do a lot to preserve returns at the thats going to be about exiting things that are shareholderdestructive but not necessarily producing much higher returns if you know what i mean so thats that and then the other part of your question implicitly was talking about organic capital generation and i think its just very important to separate impacts on the economy and impacts on longterm returns from our ability to meet the requirements of course as jamie always says jpmorgan is going to be fine and were building a lot of capital and we were managing capital conservatively and well be able to build the necessary capital in order to achieve ontime or early compliance which is always what we strive to do but that doesnt really have any particular bearing on the question of what the longterm return target is or the impacts on the real economy erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi you may proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thank you so i very much appreciate the comments in the release on the big picture things whats going on in the world and their potential impact on markets on food markets global trade everything that you mentioned and sadly agree about the most dangerous time in decades the question i have is does it surprise you that markets are hanging in that you yourself have green shoots or still green shoots type of mindset about banking while thats going on and then maybe more importantly if you believe what obviously what you wrote what are you doing about it how do you manage yourself conservatively how do you prepare for tougher times james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co you want to start okay so i mean on green shoots youll just note that our comments are cautious i mean there is momentum i do think we are a little bit more optimistic than we were but obviously markets have been bumpy both equity markets and rate markets have been very whippy recently so we dont want to get too carried away with optimism here we are coming in off a very low base and so theres a hope and an expectation that we are on the path to normalization and improvement and of course the overall economic picture at least currently looks solid this sort of immaculate disinflation trade is actually happening so those are all reasons to be a little bit optimistic in the near term but its tempered with quite a bit of caution james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so i would add a question there has been an extraordinary amount of fiscal monetary stimulus still in the system and you cant look at and of course it can drive markets sentiment in sales and profits and all that but you cant stay like this forever between qt if you never had and how much the fiscal stimulus could continue at this rate before you have kind of the crowding out kind of factor so i think people have to be very cautious and of course the geopolitics i think is just an extraordinary issue we have to deal with how do you prepare the company for that we do stress tests a week and we do multiple views of it including geopolitical problems interest rate problems but usually geopolitics presents itself usually as a deep recession or a mild recession or a recession part of the world or markets going down a lot and because markets do well is not a reason ever to say theyre going to continue to do well if you dont believe me remember the year the year and people dont predict those inflection points but my caution is that we are facing so many uncertainties out there you just got to be very cautious with what youre facing and like i said the other thing about the green shoots regardless of that we try to run the company so that we serve the clients day in and day out better products and better services securely safely and all of those things so thats the ultimate goal we know there are going to be bad times thats not a surprise that there are going to be bad times we dont always know how theyre coming and where theyre coming from but well keep on serving clients doing good for jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 clients you can build a good business kind of separate from what it does to your returns thats a slightly different issue at this point but well deal with that too when we figure out what to do glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thank you for all that all good jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks glenn operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i understand the nii strategy benefited from first republic asset sensitivity cd strategy money in motion but im curious too how much is the nii increase and the deposit benefit a function of the million digital banking customers do you have more digital banking customers than branch customers now if you can just refresh that and then a more general question i guess i have the first one for jeremy and the second one for jamie you have record tech spend whats the benefit of having record tech spend if you can kind of marktomarket your thoughts there as it relates to ai as it relates to maybe wasted spending your outlook for next year and does it really help to be the biggest tech spender in the banking industry jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes let me do digital banking mike i spent some time on this actually couple weeks ago and its interesting to note this sort of extent to which the growth in digitally engaged consumers is higher than the overall growth in consumer accounts meaning that were continuing to increase the percentage of our consumers that are digitally engaged and it sort of goes back to my prior point about james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but the percent who are digital only is much lower than that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co for sure mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc right jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co for sure which actually links to the broader point that what in terms of your question about how much is this helping the current nii story it goes to the larger point of holistic throughthecycle multichannel fully engaged customer strategy which requires a lot of investment in branches obviously but also in digital services of all sorts so in many ways you can see the current environment as a little bit of a payoff of that investment but thats not like therefore we stop investing obviously so i guess thats part of the answer and i guess your other question is the benefits of being the biggest tech spender i just think like its sort of mandatory right i mean were big and its a very technologycentric business and the world is competitive and everything is changing younger generations have different expectations and we have to be nimble and we have to be on our front foot and otherwise we risk getting severely disrupted so i dont know if jamie wants to add anything james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co just the competition when we look at it its wells whos coming back which im happy for you guys its obviously marcus its apple its chime its dave its there are a lot of people coming up these businesses in different ways and theres some whove been quite successful its stripe in payments and so we want to be very good and very competitive some of that tech spending is things which are almost a sine qua non which is cybersecurity data center resiliency regulatory requirements and things like that which we simply are going to do and be very very good at to protect the company mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc as it relates to ai specifically which is the talk of the town i guess the consensus among people outside the banking industry is that banks will not win that battle including jpmorgan you wont control the front end what are you doing with ai to make a difference now or is this just simply a moon shot james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oh i dont agree with that statement banks have an extraordinary amount of proprietary data in addition to when you do like a large language model thats public data looking at everything on the internet or everything thats ever been published or something like that but ai is a extraordinarily good tool to use we just put a woman whos running it at our table so its data analytics ai et cetera and there are multiple types of ai so we use ai for risk fraud marketing prospecting and the management teams getting better and better at saying how can we use the data to do a better job to reduce errors to serve clients better to have a salesperson have copilots so they know widen the clients coin or something like that and so we simply have to do it does it create opportunity for disruptors to come in yeah of course thats always been true with technology but well be quite good at it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly i think you had made a mention at a conference about investment spend or tech spend over the next year where do you stand on that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah now because you did ask a little bit about the expense outlook for next year so i think at the conference we said i think the consensus was billion but were still going through the budget process et cetera et cetera so thats still true i think were still kind of in the ballpark but i would say at the margin theres going to be a little bit of upward pressure james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co is that for first republic too or no jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah this is all now including first republic and i think there will be a little bit of upward pressure on that as we sort of do our usual thing and look at all of the opportunities that we see and the investments that we want to make so no surprise in that sense that were going to invest prudently nothing dramatic but probably a little bit of upward pressure at the margin mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator thank you our next question comes from jim mitchell with seaport global you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning jeremy do you think theres any receptivity among regulators regarding the double counting not only of operational risk but i think you alluded to this earlier in the markets business but theres clearly double counting in market risk in the trading book is there any receptivity james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just answer that real quickly we dont really know its a onesided conversation generally they say put it in your comments so everyone is going to put in extensive comments kind of like you heard from jeremy and we dont really know we dont really know whats going on inside the fed how many people get involved in my view its become a very politicized process as opposed to the technical analysis i think is required to do it exactly right so well see jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 okay and then if it werent to change and you talked about the potential negative impact on liquidity in the markets business specifically is that a jpm pulling out of certain businesses type event or is it more a comment that thered be fewer providers of liquidity as less scaled players exit and maybe thats almost equal a market share gain opportunity for jpmorgan in a smaller business james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think so if you look at markets alone its a huge i think increase in capital and if you look at it you can do that by product for some products its worse than for others but generally its bad across all products but the really important thing is market making is a critical function and if you look at the world only some of these large market makers who could make markets for governments hospitals cities schools states imf world bank blackrock blackstone and all those various things who buy and sell for their clients in size and market makers have a different function than hedge funds and i dont know what the real intent was with this this is another one i think that needs to be really thought through with what are you trying to accomplish we do market making quite safe weve never lost the kind of money that people talk about in market making in the global market shock or something like that but the other thing about market making i do agree it could actually force some people out it will force lower positions which is why i think its a little risky but it may also force more consolidation and so clients since they need it so much there may be consolidation in an unintended way in market making and obviously more volatile markets because with all the constraints with the lcr slr capital et cetera you will constantly be up against limitations in what you can do jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and i think that last point of jamies is particularly important because sure if you want you can construct what i would consider a very optimistic argument that the higher cost of doing business will lead smaller scale players to exit and thats a share gain opportunity for us but if i refer back to the comments about the disincentives to beneficial diversification and scale getting bigger especially in markets is quite expensive from for example a gsib perspective and so you wind up kind of hemmed in on all sides which is one of the reasons why were sort of highlighting but it does seem like the only way out sometimes when you look at the cumulative effect of everything thats happened in markets over the last years is a fundamentally very different system and while obviously james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co great opportunity for european market makers i mean a great opportunity like they can do repo and fx and swaps and credit and stuff with less capital that is a big difference in that kind of business jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right thats helpful thanks operator thank you our last question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call 13oct2023 hi good morning you talked about increased investment spend in some areas in response to an earlier question but just how do you think about cost control overall looking at the medium term the outlook for revenue is obviously pressured at least on net interest income fees might help but the backdrop is for potentially declining revenue or at least flattish revenue for a couple or few years so i know you always say you want to invest for the cycle and its really paid off over time but how are you thinking about cost control the next few years jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i wish i had sort of an answer that fit better into your framework but in some fundamental sense we just kind of dont agree with the framework in the sense that and weve been through this over the last couple of years right in a world where rates drop very suddenly and recover like quite dramatically and credit becomes abnormally good and then rebounds and youve seen these very significant fluctuations in capital markets we saw that in going into where the revenue environment can change a lot in the short term for reasons that can be largely out of your control and while of course there are parts of our expense base which are in the short term directly sensitive to the revenue environment and some of those adjust naturally and some of them we adjust more forcefully as a function of volumes but other things are much more structural and the goal is to make sure that those other things are sized appropriately to what we believe sustainable through the cycle returns are so were always very focused on cost you can be rest assured of that that discipline internally is as aggressive as ever as we go through the budget cycle but there are longterm plays and you really shouldnt expect us to see trying to generate cosmetically lower costs in response to a lower revenue environment where we didnt balloon the costs when the revenue became as weve argued unsustainably high matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah fair enough and if i could just squeeze in on first republic obviously the contribution there is coming in multiples higherthanexpected how do you think about the puts and takes in terms of i think theres probably some runoff of loans still to come but also opportunities to deepen the relationships there jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so youre right about the contribution and about the runoff of loans and it is notable the first republic related net income that weve printed this quarter so the first thing to say is that we dont think that that first republic related net income number from this quarter is a sustainable indicator of the future run rate some of the same dynamics that weve just talked about in particular overearning on deposits or sort of above normal on deposit margins also apply to the first republic franchise to some degree so we would expect that to normalize and probably more significantly as the things you alluded to we do have some accelerated pull to par on some of the commitments that we took on at a fair value discount as part of the acquisition so thats a shortterm tailwind in the revenue that will come out of that over the next few quarters and yeah in terms of how its going overall and deepening the relationships that remains a focus and i think more of that will happen as we continue the integration and we continue stabilizing and yeah i think as i said on the press call things are going well arguably a little bit better than wed sort of modeled as part of the acquisition and were happy to see that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript  earnings call
