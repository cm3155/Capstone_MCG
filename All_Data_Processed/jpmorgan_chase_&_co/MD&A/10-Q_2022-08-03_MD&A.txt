securities llc jp morgan prime inc and jp morgan strategic securities lending corp are named as defendants in a putative class action filed in the united states district court for the southern district of new york the complaint asserts violations of federal antitrust law and new york state common law in connection with an alleged conspiracy to prevent the emergence of anonymous exchange trading for securities lending transactions defendants motion to dismiss the complaint was denied plaintiffs have moved to certify a class in this action which defendants are opposing in addition to the various legal proceedings discussed above jpmorgan chase and its subsidiaries are named as defendants or are otherwise involved in a substantial number of other legal proceedings the firm believes it has meritorious defenses to the claims asserted against it in its currently outstanding legal proceedings and it intends to defend itself vigorously additional legal proceedings may be initiated from time to time in the future the firm has established reserves for several hundred of its currently outstanding legal proceedings in accordance with the provisions of us gaap for contingencies the firm accrues for a litigationrelated liability when it is probable that such a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated the firm evaluates its outstanding legal proceedings each quarter to assess its litigation reserves and makes adjustments in such reserves upward or downward as appropriate based on managements best judgment after consultation with counsel the firms legal expense was million and million for the three months ended june and respectively and million and million for the six months ended june and respectively there is no assurance that the firms litigation reserves will not need to be adjusted in the future in view of the inherent difficulty of predicting the outcome of legal proceedings particularly where the claimants seek very large or indeterminate damages or where the matters present novel legal theories involve a large number of parties or are in early stages of discovery the firm cannot state with confidence what will be the eventual outcomes of the currently pending matters the timing of their ultimate resolution or the eventual losses fines penalties or consequences related to those matters jpmorgan chase believes based upon its current knowledge and after consultation with counsel consideration of the material legal proceedings described above and after taking into account its current litigation reserves and its estimated aggregate range of possible losses that the other legal proceedings currently pending against it should not have a material adverse effect on the firms consolidated financial condition the firm notes however that in light of the uncertainties involved in such proceedings there is no assurance that the ultimate resolution of these matters will not significantly exceed the reserves it has currently accrued or that a matter will not have material reputational consequences as a result the outcome of a particular matter may be material to jpmorgan chases operating results for a particular period depending on among other factors the size of the loss or liability imposed and the level of jpmorgan chases income for that period note business segments the firm is managed on an lob basis there are four major reportable business segments consumer community banking corporate investment bank commercial banking and asset wealth management in addition there

interest is deferred and added to the principal balance of the loan option arm loans are subject to payment recast which converts the loan to a variablerate fully amortizing loan upon meeting
