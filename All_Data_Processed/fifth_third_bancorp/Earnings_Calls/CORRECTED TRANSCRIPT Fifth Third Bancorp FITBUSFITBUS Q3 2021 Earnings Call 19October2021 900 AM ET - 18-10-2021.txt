commercial and wealth and asset management excluding impact of ppp average total loans increased compared to last quarter reflecting strong commercial loan production as well as strength in our indirect auto and residential mortgage portfolios commercial loan production increased sequentially with record quarters in corporate banking and middle market despite some of the challenges we have been hearing from our customers including supply chain constraints and labor shortages the strong production was led by our healthcare renewable energy and retail verticals and was well diversified geographically our commercial lending production trends pipelines and retention of the client relationship all support continued loan growth as it relates to provide we are very pleased with the progress we have seen so far we are even more excited about the opportunities for continued growth as we have previously mentioned we expect strong origination volumes in reflecting a robust pipeline added product capabilities and key talent hires provide supports a relationship approach with approximately twothird of customers having either a deposit account or a payments relationship with fifth third during the quarter we recorded a net benefit to credit losses as well as historically low net chargeoffs of basis points reflecting continued improvement in both our commercial and consumer portfolios in addition to historically low credit losses we experienced another quarter of improvement in criticized assets and npas our criticized assets declined nearly our npa ratio declined basis points sequentially our npa and npl ratios this quarter have reverted back to prepandemic levels our strong credit performance reflects disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and continued support from fiscal and monetary government stimulus programs our balance sheet and earnings power remain very strong as weve said before we remain focused on deploying capital into organic

company will serve us well into and beyond we expect to generate positive operating leverage on a yearoveryear basis in the fourth quarter and also for the full year in we remain committed to generating sustainable longterm value and consistently producing throughthecycle top quartile results with that ill turn over to jamie to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook james c leonard chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you greg and thank all of you for joining us today were very pleased with our financial results this quarter reflecting focused execution throughout the bank our quarterly results included solid revenue growth and continued discipline on both expenses and credit the reported earnings included a million aftertax benefit or per share from the three items noted on page of the release our strong business performance throughout the bank is reflected in our return metrics we produced an adjusted roa of and an adjusted rotce excluding aoci of improvements in our loan portfolio credit quality resulted in a million release to our credit reserves and an acl ratio of basis points compared to basis points last quarter combined with our historically low net chargeoffs we had a million net benefit to the provision for credit losses moving to the income statement net interest income of approximately billion increased compared to the yearago quarter reflecting the benefits of our balance sheet positioning continuing benefits from ppp income and income from our ginnie mae forbearance loan purchases our nii results relative to the second quarter included a million reduction in ppp income a million decline in prepayment penalties in our investment portfolio and the impact of lower earning asset yields partially offset by a higher day count and a reduction in longterm debt our allocation to bullet and lockedout structures is currently of the total investment portfolio which is expected to continue to provide ongoing nii protection in this lowrate environment on the liability side weve reduced our interestbearing core deposit costs another basis point this quarter to basis points with a highly asset sensitive balance sheet and over billion of excess liquidity we continue to be wellpositioned to benefit when interest rates rise while also remaining wellhedged if rates remain low given our securities portfolio and derivatives total reported noninterest income increased sequentially impacted by a million gain associated with the disposition of hsa deposits as previously communicated adjusted noninterest income increased driven by strong mortgage banking treasury management leasing and wealth and asset management revenues fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 commercial banking revenue which achieved record results the past two quarters remained solid as strength in ma advisory fees particularly in our healthcare vertical was more than offset by lower corporate bond fees compared to the yearago quarter adjusted noninterest income increased with improvement in every single caption reflecting both the underlying strength in our lines of business as well as the robust economic rebound over the past year our total noninterest revenue was of total revenue in the third quarter reported noninterest expense increased compared to the second quarter primarily due to the million foundation contribution adjusted expenses were flat sequentially as an increase in marketing expense associated with momentum banking and increased te expense were offset by a decrease in compensation and benefits expense compared to the yearago quarter adjusted noninterest expense increased primarily driven by an increase in performancebased compensation reflecting strong business results servicing expenses associated with ginnie mae loan purchases and the impact of the provide acquisition these items were partially offset by lower card and processing expense due to contract renegotiation and lower net occupancy expense on a yearoveryear basis total adjusted fees have increased compared to just expense growth moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases declined half of a percent sequentially including the headwind from ppp loans excluding ppp average loans and leases increased with periodend loans up pointing to positive momentum as we head into the fourth quarter average total consumer portfolio loans increased as continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage balances were partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card balances while we did not retain incremental conforming mortgage originations in the third quarter we have elected to retain approximately million of our retail mortgage production for the balance sheet in the fourth quarter and well continue to evaluate the economic tradeoffs given our balance sheet capacity in this environment average commercial loans declined compared to the prior quarter due entirely to ppp forgiveness excluding ppp average commercial loans increased around half of a percent with ci loans up production was robust across the board up compared to the prior quarter with both corporate and middle market banking generating record production which was well diversified geographically as a result periodend ci loans excluding ppp increased revolver utilization of was stable compared to the prior quarter however it is worth noting that total commitments have increased approximately billion since the end of last year driven by new client acquisition and an increase in demand from existing clients in anticipation of future business growth average cre loans were down sequentially with lower balances in mortgage and construction driven by elevated payoffs in areas most impacted by the pandemic reflecting our cautious approach to those sectors our securities portfolio was stable sequentially we continue to reinvest portfolio cash flows but will remain patient on deploying the excess liquidity assuming no meaningful changes to our economic outlook we would expect to begin our excess cash deployment when investment yields move north of the 200basispoint level we remain optimistic that continued gdp growth in the feds eventual tapering of bond purchases will present more attractive riskreturn opportunities in the future average other shortterm investments which includes fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 interestbearing cash remain elevated reflecting growth in core deposits since the onset of the pandemic which are up yearoveryear moving to credit our strong credit performance this quarter once again reflects our disciplined client selection conservative underwriting prudent balance sheet management and the continued benefit of fiscal and monetary stimulus programs and improvement in the broader economy as greg mentioned the third quarter net chargeoff ratio of basis points was historically low and improved basis points sequentially nonperforming assets declined with the npa ratio declining basis points sequentially to basis points the decline in criticized assets reflected significant improvements in retail non essential and leisure consistent with the reopening of the economy and higher activity in those sectors as well as improvements in our energy and leveraged loan portfolios we continue to focus on segments of nonowner occupied commercial real estate particularly central business district hotels as activity have not yet returned to prepandemic levels moving to the acl our base case macroeconomic scenario is relatively similar to last quarter which assumes the labor market continues to improve and job growth continues to strengthen with unemployment reaching in the first quarter of and ending our threeyear reasonable and supportable period at around we did not change our scenario weights of to the base and to the upside and downside scenarios however our acl release was lower this quarter as the improvement in the underlying economic forecast decelerated from the second quarter additionally the acl requirement in the downside scenario worsened compared to the second quarter due to a forecasted slower pace of recovery and a larger increase in unemployment if the acl were based on the downside scenario the acl would be million higher if the acl were weighted to the baseline scenario the reserve would be million lower while the favorable economic backdrop and our base case expectations point to further improvement in the economy there are several key risks factored into our downside scenario which could play out given the uncertain environment in addition to covid we continue to monitor the economic and lending implications of the supply chain and labor market constraints that currently exist our september 30th allowance incorporates our best estimate of the economic environment with lower unemployment and continued improvement in credit quality moving to capital our capital levels remained strong in the third quarter our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at during the quarter we completed million in share repurchases which reduced our share count by million shares compared to the second quarter we also raised our common dividend or to per share our capital plans support approximately million of share repurchases in the fourth quarter of and we continue to target a cet1 by june moving to our fourth quarter outlook we expect average total loan balances to increase sequentially excluding the ppp headwind including the ppp impact we expect average total loans to increase approximately our outlook reflects point of improvement from commercial revolving line utilization continued strength in commercial production given our record pipelines and a continued stabilization in paydowns based on activity that we are seeing so far in october fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 we expect average ci growth of to excluding ppp in the fourth quarter and cre balances to decline around or so primarily due to construction constraints as a result we anticipate total average commercial loan growth of around sequentially excluding ppp we expect average total consumer loan balances to increase around sequentially including the impacts of ginnie mae forbearance pool purchases and our held forsale portfolio we purchased million during the third quarter and additional million in early october given our loan outlook we expect nii to be down sequentially in the fourth quarter assuming stable securities balances and a million reduction in ppp income excluding ppp we expect fourth quarter nii to be up slightly relative to the third quarter our guidance indicates full year nii declines less than compared to fullyear despite no meaningful growth in investment securities balances throughout the year and an average decline in 1month libor of approximately basis points we expect nim to decline to basis points in the fourth quarter primarily due to loan yield compression we expect fourth quarter fees to increase around compared to the third quarter and to be up around on a yearoveryear basis excluding the impacts of the tra this results in fullyear fee growth excluding the impacts of the tra of approximately compared to our outlook assumes a continued healthy economy resulting in a record fullyear commercial banking revenue led by growth in capital markets fees record wealth and asset management revenue up double digits and doubledigit growth in card and processing revenue we expect private equity income to be in the million area in the fourth quarter our outlook assumes a sequential decline in top line mortgage revenue of approximately with roughly half of that decline due to seasonally lower fourth quarter volumes and declining spreads and half to our decision to retain million in retail production that i mentioned earlier we expect fourth quarter expenses to be stable to up compared to the third quarter reflecting continued growth in technology investments servicing expenses associated with the ginnie mae loan purchases and continued marketing support related to our rollout of momentum offset by disciplined expense management throughout the company and initial savings beginning from our process automation program as a result our fullyear total core revenue growth is expected to exceed the growth in core expenses despite the rate environment we will have achieved positive operating leverage in a year in which the vast majority of the industry will likely experience an erosion in efficiency we expect total net chargeoffs in the fourth quarter to be in the to basis points range which would result in fullyear chargeoffs of basis points or so in summary our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle we will continue to rely on the same principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and a focus on a longterm performance horizon which has served us well during this environment with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and one followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning operator please open the call up for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning scott james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey just wanted to ask a couple questions on loan growth which looks like its coming back nicely first i was hoping you could talk about any differences youre seeing in demand between your larger and smaller customers jamie i think you had mentioned that production sounded pretty strong in both corporate and middle market so any additional color there and then second was just wondering if you could speak to the dynamics youre seeing in terms of both pricing and structure just in other words changes to the competitive environment gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp this is greg let me start off and then ill flip it over to tim and maybe jamie first off were very encouraged what were seeing from a production perspective weve got commercial loan production in the third quarter coming along strong at billion that was up from billion in the second quarter and billion in the third quarter we expect that production to continue to be stable going into the fourth quarter so thats encouraging we expect average loans up with ppp and up without ppp so thats some strength there were also seeing line utilization tick up a little bit more in our core middle market which is nice to see that for a change fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 so when you think about our geographies what were seeing right now from a geography perspective north carolina texas cincinnati columbus were our top four markets from commercial loan growth in  which is encouraging if you look at six regions that had alltime highs which were very encouraged with chicago grand rapids columbus kentucky north carolina and texas so that felt really good and were starting to see once again some good momentum out there net new relationships something we watch very carefully brought in new commercial relationships yearto date most of that was in core middle market and some of that in large corp and netnet were seeing good progress out there good performance encouraged by what were seeing todate as we go into the fourth quarter and then into tim timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yes just to add a few points to what greg mentioned so i had the chance to be out in of our regions this past quarter i think you get really excellent color when you have an opportunity to sit with clients and with bankers i mean theyre all feeling the shortages as it relates to labor and supply chain we have hotel operators who are now only cleaning rooms when people leave as an example i visited an electronics client out west and asked to see their demo room and there was nothing but holes in the walls i said where is the equipment and they had sold all the inventory because they are struggling to get the parts in to be able to fill orders so all those issues are still real i think the good news is we are seeing ma as a catalyst were seeing capex now as a catalyst in particular for businesses that are able to substitute equipment and automation for manual processes and then bluntly as greg mentioned i think we feel pretty confident that a lot of the improvement were seeing is just coming from taking share i mean the relationship count greg mentioned would be higher than where we were at prior to the pandemic so well have taken more new relationships onboard this year through nine months than we had in all of or just as an example so good general pickup there it would be great to continue to see a little bit more activity as it relates to utilization as folks try to build inventories and otherwise its just thats going to be the wildcard for us gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp jamie let me add one thing and scott also if you look at our verticals which i should have mentioned is our largest production the areas were seeing the larger strength in right now is technology media telecom our retailers financial institutions are all going well so were seeing some good momentum in those spaces james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and then scott to answer the second part of your question in terms of the segments i think greg and tim did a nice summary there what were seeing from a line utilization perspective is that the middle market line utilization is up almost whereas corporate banking continues to trend down so quarteroverquarter that utilization was stable and if we want to go into the decimals it was at the end of june and its as we sat here september but we are starting to see more borrowing demand and pickup in the middle market space as opposed to the corporate banking fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 and then in terms of pricing while nim came in as expected in line with our july guide we do have the headwind in the ci yield portfolio because it is very competitive out there i think for the most part banks are competing on price and nonbanks are competing on structure so for us the price headwind comes in just a little bit tighter spreads but also some of the reduction in the libor floor so you lose some of that excess earnings in this environment but you can perhaps recapture the yield benefit as the fed starts to move on the front end of the curve hopefully in the next year to months so as expected but certainly a headwind when it comes to pricing r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay good thank you very much for all the color operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you guys have done a phenomenal job on the securities yield with the rate locks on the cash flows and the bullets im wondering is this type of securities yield sustainable into next year with the rate locks continuing james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i would say peter were inoculated from the rate environment but were not immune to it so as you saw in the numbers this quarter and as we look out even next quarter it is a steady grind down as we reinvest the cash flows so thats hurts the yield a bit basis points or so if you look out on the bullets themselves theyre at a yield with cash flows i think were projecting about billion of cash flows in that portfolio over the next five years so there will be a stepdown should rates stay where they are today reinvestment yields right now i think are in the to range so barring a curve steepener it will be a slow but definitely downward trend on the portfolio yield the good news for us is were very well positioned and it is pretty insulated from the environment relative to how the peers have positioned their portfolio peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thanks and if i could just followup on expenses youve had the benefit of those expense initiatives this year which clearly benefited when looking at the fee income growth relative to the expense growth can you just fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 talk about some of the expense saves opportunities going forward as we go into next year or has a lot of the lowhanging fruit been realized and if you could also talk about any inflation pressures looking into next year james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure thanks for the question the one update we have on expense savings in our program for is that we are targeting million in savings for and thats a combination of the lean process automation intelligent operations the branch closures we have branches closing in the first quarter of and then some smaller vendor savings bundled together so weve tightened the range on that bundle savings from million to million to million and then obviously were not getting into expense guide for because well continue to evaluate how much of those savings will be reinvested into sales force expansion on commercial as well as the wealth and asset management but we feel good about the progress were making on the lpa program in fact if you look in the press release buried i think at the bottom of page is an fte count and were down a couple hundred fte even with adding about a hundred from the provide acquisition and thats starting to show the benefit of that lpa savings so weve made progress weve had some success theres about million of savings in our fourth quarter forecast tied into that program but then the million for next year timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp and the head count there doesnt even reflect the benefit from the offshore right the automation savings on offshore processes that were completed by jv partners where were i think north of at this point of the processes that were offshore now fully automated james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i think from the other part of your question on inflation in terms of wage inflation and other things weve been able to manage through the environment from an employee and cost structure and still deliver fairly stable expenses this quarter we continue to see opportunity to do the same while there is the wage inflation and other pressure we do have those other opportunities ahead of us and so perhaps some of the million would be absorbed by some inflationary pressure but ultimately a moderate amount of inflation would ultimately be very positive for the bank in terms of ppnr and interest income capabilities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks jamie operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 good morning everyone gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning gerard james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc greg when you look at your cet1 ratio you targeted to bring it down to by june of next year it looks like if i recall correctly your required number is by the feds what would it take for you guys to bring it down from to something lower or is it now the is set in stone and youre just not going to budge off on that gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp well theres nothing set in stone gerard but at the end of the day we think thats the prudent place to be its multifaceted as we think about that level and we obviously believe we can run the bank at a much lower level but also we watch what the market is doing the environment were operating in what our peers are doing we just think thats a prudent target point to shoot for at this point gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then maybe richard we could talk about credit quality obviously your numbers similar to some of your peers are quite strong particularly in the net chargeoff area and i suspect that this is unusually good and its not sustainable just due to normal seasoning of portfolios how long do you think you guys could see net chargeoffs stay at this extremely low level and when do you think that they start creeping up to a more normal level i know normal is hard to define but when do they start to creep up richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah gerard thanks for the question clearly were pleased with the basis points this quarter and like you said we dont think thats going to repeat but given the economic outlook we do expect chargeoffs to be better than our throughthecycle average and probably certainly into and into for a couple of reasons one its going to be simply the amount of liquidity thats out there two inflation collateral values continue to be strong and when we run our midcycle stress test were seeing to basis points as a chargeoff range for the bank through and now as i said its a little bit lower than what we think the longterm average is if you recall we think throughthe cycle average is somewhere between and basis points but given our approach given the way we manage the balance sheet the way we think about client selection and underwriting we think its a grind through and back to something that feels a little bit more normal fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great appreciate it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hi thanks good morning hey jamie i was just wondering if you could elaborate a little bit more on the portfolio structure so when you talk about the billion thats kind of going to runoff over the next several years how high are you on that part of the book and when youre reinvesting the cash flows to keep the book flat are you also buying back some new type of bullet structures or are you just more investing in kind of plain vanilla today james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so weve been buying a little bit of everything when were reinvesting the portfolio of cash flows have been running about billion a quarter second quarter third quarter so depending on the day weve added some level weve added some level but in total the mix hasnt really changed a whole lot and then in terms of the bullets over the next couple years its a very small number in terms of total cash flow maybe couple hundred million and then over years three four five then you start to have cash flow portfolio but right now the total book bullets as well as the cash flowing securities were in a yield give or take and then for the fourth quarter yield should be a little bit better than that with a little bit of seasonal mutual fund dividends in the nqdc plus a little bit of prepayment penalties that have occurred thus far in october ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it thank you and just a followup you guys have been really taking down the longterm debt footprint which is still even at its size the majority of your interestbearing liability costs just wonder where is the level that you need to keep it at and whats the tradeoff versus the deposit base the mix of deposits and how much more could you potentially return reduce that footprint thanks james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes were probably at the low point in terms of the longterm debt outstanding we had a maturity in september million that well perhaps look to replenish in the next quarter or two but i think were at a good spot and were well positioned weve been able to utilize the excess liquidity and take advantage of the environment to deliver some savings from a cost standpoint both from longterm debt as well as running off some of the cd book that certainly behaves more like wholesale funding than the core deposit book so i think were in a good spot and well probably reach the end of the line on the longterm debt but probably have a little bit more room on the cd book to run it down a little bit more ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it thank you fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning john james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc greg you mentioned some key talent hires that should help drive loan production into can you provide a little bit of color on the areas where youre hiring particularly within the lending areas and if that hiring is continuing thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely thanks for the question obviously the southeast markets where weve been adding to our relationship management bankers in that market with a lot of success there so were really pleased with the production were seeing in that market so well continue to add in that market theres great opportunities and we run a good franchise down there and thats obviously a focal point for our expansion in addition to that i would say texas the west coast california the talent weve been able to acquire in those markets the bankers that weve brought on significant increases of bankers in those markets over the last two three years and were seeing great progress from a production perspective outstanding perspective so like those are the strategies we watch them very carefully we invest where we see opportunities and those areas continue to be great opportunities for us more to come so let me just turn over to tim to see if he has any color he wants to add to that timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yes i think a couple other i think greg hit the geographic points we also are in the process of building out a mortgage warehouse vertical thats a good business for us its a business weve been in historically but it hasnt been a point of focus and we saw an opportunity there with some talent to go out and take some market share so i think thats an area we continue to add to the renewables team and are focused on how we expand what is already i think a pretty strong capability there and a good track record and then we were pleased to be able to land some really important talent into provide post the provide acquisition and have now formally launched the vet vertical there for veterinarians which i think is going to be a really good source of growth to complement the strength we already have in medical dental in that business line fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thank you and then secondly if you could just update us where you stand on core system upgrade can you maybe remind us of the timing of the project and the cost that you see tied to it and then separately do you see any risk to the cost that you had budgeted for the upgrade given the wage inflation dynamics thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp first off our tech budget is let me take that first is about million that has been growing about per year for the last five years when you think about our core platforms and we talked about the modernization effort that has been going on for a couple years you saw that with our mortgage loan origination system the resiliency platforms we put in place the data architecture strategy we rolled out next coming up is obviously fis core deposits and were in the midst right now turning on ncino thats going extremely well and something were very pleased with so this is an ongoing effort if you ask me if it was a baseball analogy were probably in mid innings here but its a long game and well continue to invest prudently in addition to that when you think about our tech spend a lot of the tech spend is focused on being able to take cost out so lean process automation has been a great focus of our business and an area where weve made a lot of progress in so well continue to invest for those opportunities well continue to stay focused on core platform replacement our partnership with fis the fact that were the largest processing customer if you think about how we think about that business and the integration what weve done with the core platforms well be able to manage costs very efficiently and effectively through that exercise so were very comfortable with what we think the new operating environment will look like from a cost perspective but if you think about our tech spend how we think about our business its really of keeping the business running so to speak of advancing the business and then protecting the business timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yes john its tim one just small point to add to that and it came up earlier there was a question about inflation and wages jamie said earlier we were immune but not inoculated on a different point im sorry inoculated but not immune on a different point i think here again we raised our minimum wage to an hour in i think we were the first of the regional banks certainly of our peer group to have made that move and the byproduct of that is we are watching as im sure you are the announcements coming out of many of our peers that theyre raising their minimum wage but theyre getting to an hour in nearly all cases which is where fifth third is already at the byproduct of that is a lot of that nearterm impact is kind of in our run rate john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on your net chargeoff rate commentary as you think about the normalization of your nco rates off these low levels to the basis points in that you mentioned is the level of your reserve rate currently high enough such that the trajectory is also likely to be flat to down even as nco rates normalize higher any color that you can give on that dynamic would be helpful james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think its a little tough to take a life of loan expected loss rate of the acl and compare it to shortterm forecast because the loan maturity is certainly are a swing factor in that so obviously were comfortable with our acl at basis points its basis points excluding ppp so yeah im comfortable that the acl is adequate to cover the expected losses over the life of the loans and then when richard was talking about those periodic chargeoff levels for a point in time and with a fairly shorter duration portfolio throwing off some of those losses in the consumer side card and auto i think were at a good spot bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah very helpful thank you and then following up on the utilization commentary to the extent that supply chain problems were to extend further into next year how much do you think that weighs on just given the makeup of your client base how much would that sort of weigh on the normalization of utilization rates versus the potential for those utilization rates to continue to improve even if those supply chain problems were to extend a bit longer james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think were seeing stable line utilization because of those supply chain constraints so hopefully the worstcase scenario would be stable as we talked about in our guide we expect a little bit of an uptick both from the seasonal and yearend positioning with our customers of about so weve reduced our outlook on utilization because of the supply chain and labor constraints from a next year perspective hopefully they get resolved and well start to see inventory builds and that should provide a little bit of a tailwind to our loan growth expectations bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was wondering if you could dig a little bit more into some of the loan yield pressure that you were talking about earlier and if you kind of just hold rates constant when does that eventually flatten out james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah matt for our quarter if you look in the tables and you look at the gross yield decline to its really driven by three factors one had elevated prepayment loan fees that get recorded in the nii so was high so that was a portion you have regular repricing front book back book phenomenon and thats i would characterize it as basis points or so of nim from that and i expect that should continue into the fourth quarter and then the other phenomenon on the libor floor is more a consequence of getting through renewal season and some of the other things happening out of the second quarter so that should dissipate but that was call it a third to half of that yield compression you see in the tables in the earnings release so as we look ahead i would expect a couple bps to bps headwind from ci loan yield compression for all of those factors into the fourth quarter and thats why were guiding the reported nim down as well for the fourth quarter similar to what we saw in the third quarter matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i guess beyond i mean is there still a fair amount of repricing between the back book and the front book and all that or james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp its matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc are you getting close to sorry go ahead james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp no thanks for the question i think from a front book back book perspective the tailwind of the curve steepening weve seen in the third quarter and should that continue well hit that intersection but until we get a little more lift you do have the repricing effect continuing where new loans are coming on at lower yields than the runoff and paydowns in the back book fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 i think on top of that we have done a nice job managing nii and the balance sheet through this environment and we certainly have dry powder whether its through the asset sensitivity or the billion of excess cash that we could choose to deploy to mitigate those effects if need be but for now we still think patience is still the way to go and therefore if theres a little bit of nim compression along the way thats fine our focus is more on the longterm and delivering the best performance we can over the next five years matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well you mentioned positive operating leverage in even while you spent more on tech and that youre in kind of the fourth or fifth inning of your tech transformation so i guess the question is do you intend to continue to spend around more on tech each year and how is that changing especially as you move off premise as much as you are is there going to be a period where you have to run somewhat parallel systems and then youll get the benefit in a few years out and more generally how do you think about the number of tech partners that you have and if you can quantify the number ill take that too gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah hey mike this is greg listen i think is probably the right number for us thats not cast in stone as you mentioned operating leverage positive operating leverage thats something were very focused on well deliver in as we go into our planning process for our focus is on positive operating leverage so as i mentioned earlier a lot of that some of that tech spend is going right to process efficiencies we were able to take out the 200plus additional people and so forth branch closures some things that were working on right now on the other expense side of the house supports that positive operating leverage and we continue to grow fees at a really robust rate close to cagr over the last couple of years so netnet positive operating leverage something were very focused on and believe we can continue to deliver on in addition to that the tech spend will roughly run around 10pluspercent fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 when you think about the core platform modernization we talked about the fourth or fifth inning i think of it more as a cricket test match it has been going on its going to continue to go on for quite some time were going to have to deal with that but at the end of the day i think as we put these new platforms in were able to do it in a very systematic way with respect to how we turn these platforms on so its not the big bang approach were able to turn it on by geography by product line so were very insulated from having to do a big bang impact with that said you have some dual system platforms that are going to run simultaneously till we get all markets all products converted over in the case of some of our major implementations coming up like our core deposit platform so thats going to take a little bit of time at the end of the day we should be a lot more efficient we should be able to bring more enhancements at a different cadence forward to our business we should be able to continue to take out costs through our lean process automation and our investments in ai technology so netnet tech is going to be a source of spend for us in that range that i mentioned before as we go forward but then i think were getting paid very well for it our objective is to go headtohead with the fintech players the large bank competitors that we have to deal with and be very successful and weve been able to do that and demonstrate that when you think about the fintech players that are out there weve got the same capabilities weve got our products like momentum but we also got free atms banking centers and service personnel that they dont have and we got the core relationships so netnet well continue to stay focused but thats kind of the range were going to operate in mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats helpful just one more followup just one simple thought i mean theres a debate of how much banks should keep onpremise versus offpremise clearly youre going more in the offpremise direction and it seems like youre accelerating that what was the tipping point what was the biggest factor to say you know what we want to have more of the open architecture the offpremise even though some other banks are saying we want to keep a lot of onpremise gregory d carmichael a chairman of the board president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp i think we intend to transition we said onpremise and you think about that over the next five years as we look at this thats going to shift as we mentioned before so onpremise is going to shift to roughly off premise and of that will be hosted in a private cloud when you think about platforms like fis ncino thats all going to be private clouds and the public cloud aws about so you think about the shift will be an offpremise model and roughly private public mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david konrad with kbw fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2021 david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey i was hoping you could help us out with if theres any constraint limitations on the balance sheet meaning as we look at our earnings models over the next couple years and redeploy a lot of the excess liquidity just wondering some of your peers has mentioned maybe earning assets would be the limit of securities regardless of rate so just wondering if you thought about a constraint on the securities book and then also embedded in the securities book the cmbs portfolio has kind of crept up now its just under of the available for sale didnt know if there its all agency or predominantly agency with that theres a concentration limit that you have on that portfolio as well thank you james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes thanks for the question david the short answer is that when we look at the excess liquidity call it billion we expect a third of it to go into the securities portfolio a third of it into loans a third of it we think while deposits in the banking system may not decline we do expect those deposits to find a more productive home perhaps money market funds or other investment vehicles so for us were running at or so in the securities book as a percent of total assets so if we take call it billion of the excess liquidity and put it into the book were at thats where id like to operate at somewhere to of total assets but its not a capacity constraint its more i think given the environment thats a more productive place to be in terms of the cmbs i think the heart of your question is asked what is at the what is the nonagency cmbs portion of the portfolio and thats billion or so and again for us its super senior tranches we feel very good about the credit enhancement 30pluspercent there so not a large credit risk position to have whereas the rest of the cmbs book would be agency guaranteed david joseph konrad q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you operator at this time there are no
