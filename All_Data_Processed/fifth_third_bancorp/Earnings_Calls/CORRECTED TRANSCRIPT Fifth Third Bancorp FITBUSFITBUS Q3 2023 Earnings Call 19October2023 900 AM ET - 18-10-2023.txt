chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp thanks chris and good morning everyone we believe that great banks distinguish themselves not by how they perform in benign environments but rather by how they navigate challenging ones that is why we focus on stability profitability and growth in that order it is also why i am so pleased that our key return and profitability metrics remain resilient despite the marketrelated headwinds that all banks are facing earlier today we reported earnings per share of or excluding a impact from our visa swap reflecting strong ppnr results and favorable credit outcomes we generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity ex aoci of nearly which increased basis points sequentially and a return on assets of we generated strong fee growth compared to the year ago quarter supported by a more diverse range of fee income streams than peers and our investments in treasury management capital markets and wealth management our third quarter total noninterest expense increased less than compared to the year ago quarter and we generated an adjusted efficiency ratio below in the last four years we have managed expenses to the lowest growth rate among peers despite also investing in growth by building more new branches raising our minimum wage modernizing our technology platforms and acquiring four fintech companies expense management at fifth third is a continuous process and not a program since march of this year fulltime equivalent employee head count is down fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 turning to the balance sheet we generated average deposit growth compared to the yearago quarter versus a decline for the industry new relationship growth remained strong consumer households grew more than led by growth in the southeast a continuation of our multiyear growth pace new middle market relationships added yeartodate remain ahead of last years record pace thanks to the release of the annual fdic summary of deposits the third quarter provides a unique opportunity to understand market share gains and losses on a metro area by metro area basis this year fifth third maintained or improved our market rank in every single one of our largest msas in the midwest we maintained our number two overall position behind jpmorgan chase in the southeast where we are just four years removed from opening our first nextgen branch we have reached or are approaching target locational share in of our original focus markets we intend to continue to open approximately branches per year through at which time nearly of our branches will be in southeast markets these market share gains are the byproduct of multiyear strategies that are not easily replicable by competitors they include innovative operational depositoriented products like momentum banking aidriven customer acquisition strategies and a top quartile customer service model in addition to our investments in new branches our key credit metrics remained strong during the quarter chargeoffs were in line with our july expectations and both earlystage delinquencies and nonperforming assets improved sequentially the acl increased basis points given slight changes to moodys macroeconomic forecast turning to liquidity and capital we made significant progress against our goal to adapt early to expected changes in the regulatory framework our focused efforts throughout the bank enabled us to end the quarter with billion in total liquidity sources and to achieve full category i lcr compliance at the end of both august and september during the quarter we also made significant progress on our rwa optimization initiative total rwa declined compared to the prior quarter our exercise should be complete by the end of the fourth quarter so we can return to growing loans next year we accreted over basis points of cet1 capital during the quarter reflecting our strong earnings power while we also raised our quarterly dividend by with respect to the economy while aggregate figures on spending and employment remains strong and market sentiment has shifted more in favor of a soft landing we continue to be more cautious given concerning signals disguised beneath the aggregates for example while the most recent headline payroll numbers were strong most if not all of the job growth is a byproduct of more people working parttime jobs real average weekly earnings slipped every month during the quarter and the lowerend of the consumer spectrum now maintains deposit balances below precovid levels anecdotally the last time google searches for soft landing were this high was in may of before i turn it over i want to say thank you to our employees for everything you do to take care of our customers strengthen our communities and support one another your efforts are why time magazine recently recognized fifth third as one of the worlds best companies and why i am as confident as ever in fifth thirds ability to outperform throughthecycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders with that jamie will provide more details on our third quarter financial results and outlook fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 james c leonard chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today our third quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds we continue to strengthen our capital and liquidity levels ahead of pending regulations while also managing our business very efficiently we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio below reflecting ongoing expense discipline throughout the bank and the continued diversification and resilience of our fee revenue streams net interest income of approximately billion decreased sequentially our nii and nim results reflect our proactive and continued defensive positioning given the uncertain economic and regulatory environments our shortterm investments which primarily represent our cash held at the fed increased billion on an average basis and increased billion on an endofperiod basis to billion this increased level of cash was the primary driver of our 12basispoint nim decline adjusted noninterest income increased compared to the yearago quarter driven by growth in capital markets and deposit service charge revenue partially offset by a decrease in mortgage revenue driven primarily by lower origination volumes our ability to produce strong capital markets revenue in a volatile market has become a key distinction for fifth third compared to many peers adjusted noninterest expense increased just compared to the year ago quarter reflecting growth in compensation and benefits occupancy and technology expenses partially offset by continued expense discipline across the company moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases decreased sequentially due to softening customer demand and our rwa optimization efforts average ci balances decreased sequentially as tim mentioned clients remain cautious with respect to their growth plans consequently production was muted in corporate banking also average cre balances decreased compared to the prior quarter the period end commercial revolver utilization rate of increased compared to last quarter partially due to our exit of certain lowerreturning unused commercial commitments on a sequential basis total corporate banking commitments and unused commitments decreased and respectively while total middle market commitments and unused commitments increased and respectively this trend highlights our capital optimization efforts while we continue to grow share in the middle market average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances decreased sequentially due to our intentional decline in indirect auto and the overall slowdown in residential mortgage originations given the rate environment partially offset by growth from dividend finance our card balances increased just this quarter reflecting our conservative risk culture and focus on transactors balances have increased relative to the year ago quarter compared to for the industry average total deposits increased sequentially as increases in cds and interest checking balances were partially offset by a decline in demand deposits given the mixshift we have seen for several quarters ddas as a percent of core deposits were for the quarter compared to in the prior quarter the 2point decline was primarily due to the strong deposit growth in the denominator that tim highlighted from our net new relationship growth in both consumer and commercial which are obviously skewed to interestbearing products in this environment as a result we added more than billion in core deposits during the quarter the most since the fourth quarter of additionally the dda migration continued to show signs of deceleration this quarter and marked the smallest dollar decline in dda balances since the onset of the rate hiking cycle fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 by segment average consumer deposits increased sequentially and commercial deposits increased while wealth and asset management deposits declined reflecting clients alternative investment options as a result of our balance sheet positioning and success adding new deposits we achieved a loantocore deposit ratio of at quarterend which should be one of the best if not the best compared to our regional peers we also achieved full category i lcr compliance at at quarterend moving to credit as tim mentioned credit has remained resilient the net chargeoff ratio of basis points increased basis points compared to the prior quarter as we expected reflecting two credits which had been fully reserved earlystage delinquencies decreased compared to the prior quarter while loans days past due of just basis points were a record low for fifth third nonperforming loans decreased this quarter marked the lowest inflows of commercial npls since the second quarter of from an overall credit management perspective we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining highquality relationships as many of you know we tightened underwriting standards during covid which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet in consumer we have focused on lending to homeowners which is a segment less impacted by inflationary pressures and have maintained conservative underwriting policies in commercial we have maintained the lowest overall cre concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years our criticized non performing and delinquent cre loans have all improved sequentially and remain very wellbehaved and within that the same is true for our office exposures for instance criticized office loans represented just of total office cre which improved basis points sequentially additionally we have zero delinquencies and zero chargeoffs we also decreased loan balances by in the office book without any loan sales these credit quality metrics are significantly better than peers who have reported their office exposures so far this quarter while credit quality in the office portfolio has remained very strong and we continue to believe the overall impact on fifth third will be limited we nevertheless continue to watch it closely given the environment our shared national credit portfolio also remains very strong from a credit quality perspective with criticized assets nonperforming loans and net chargeoffs consistently lower than the overall commercial portfolio across a multiyear period our credit resilience highlights our proactive risk culture we continue to closely monitor all exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress throughout the entire portfolio as well as the fallout from the ongoing labor strike in the auto manufacturing sector where we think our exposures are very manageable moving to the acl our reserves decreased million but the coverage ratio increased basis points sequentially to as the impact of lower period end loans was offset by a slightly worse overall base case economic outlook as you know we incorporate moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance both the moodys base scenario and the downside scenario used for the third quarter acl assume a slightly worse average unemployment rate compared to the prior quarter we maintained our scenario weightings of to the base and to each the upside and downside scenarios moving to capital our cet1 ratio increased basis points sequentially ending the quarter at our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation combined with the impact of our rwa diet our tangible book value per share excluding aoci increased compared to the year ago quarter we continue to expect improvement in our unrealized securities losses resulting in approximately fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of and approximately twothirds by assuming the forward curve plays out looking forward we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our rwa optimization initiative and our continued deferment of share buybacks we anticipate accreting capital such that our cet1 ratio ends this year above moving to our current outlook we expect fourth quarter average total loan balances to decline to sequentially with consumer loans down and commercial loans down this reflects our overall cautious economic outlook combined with one more quarter of our rwa diet as we are responding quickly to higher risk adjusted return thresholds throughout the bank considering the economic and regulatory environments we expect average deposits to be up slightly on a sequential basis within that we expect core deposits to increase due to our multiyear investments in the franchise to add households and primary commercial relationships along with the benefit from seasonality while we continue to expect modest migration from dda into interestbearing products in a higherforlonger interest rate environment specifically for the fourth quarter we expect the mix of dda to core deposits to remain relatively stable given those seasonal benefits shifting to the income statement we expect fourth quarter nii to be down approximately to sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics i mentioned our nii guidance assumes no additional rate hikes and a cumulative beta which includes cds and excludes ddas of by the fourth quarter excluding brokered deposits that we have been using as a replacement for other wholesale funding given the pricing considerations our cumulative beta expectation continues to be this outlook translates to total interestbearing deposit costs increasing to basis points in the fourth quarter our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable through year end as a byproduct of our strong deposit growth combined with our loan outlook and stable securities balances we expect to hold closer to billion in cash and cash equivalents by year end given these balance trends we expect our loantocore deposit ratio to continue to move lower through the end of the year which will keep fifth third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements including remaining compliant with the full category lcr we expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest income to increase to compared to the third quarter we expect revenues to remain resilient across most captions driven by our multiyear focus on growing a diverse portfolio of fee businesses that should perform well in different economic environments we expect fourth quarter tra revenue of million compared to million in the fourth quarter of we expect fourth quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to be stable to up compared to the third quarter our guidance excludes the pending fdic special assessment which we currently estimate at million for fifth third with respect to credit quality we expect fourth quarter net chargeoffs to be to basis points we do expect to gradually normalize from here we continue to believe that our throughthecycle annual chargeoffs will be in the to 45basispoint range given the credit risk profile of the bank given our reduced loan outlook we expect the change in the acl for the fourth quarter to be stable to up million assuming no significant changes in the underlying moodys economic scenarios this considers fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 production from dividend finance of around million in the fourth quarter which as you know carries a higher reserve level of around in summary with our proactive balance sheet management disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance throughthecycle we believe we are wellpositioned to meet the proposed regulatory requirements while continuing to generate longterm value for our shareholders with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call up for qa question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everybody thank you for taking the question jamie i was hoping you maybe you can could expand even a little more on your thoughts on bringing in so many deposits in the third quarter i know youre trying to get your liquidity to a certain very high level and you achieved it but it was just a kind of astonishing number so just curious as to what the thinking throughout the quarter was i guess the additional forwardlook though you provided some of the deposit commentary or expectations in there but just any additional thoughts would be helpful please james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah thanks scott for the question we were certainly ringing the victory bell on deposits this quarter really when you take a look back coming out of march madness one the biggest drivers of our deposit success in the second quarter and the third quarter was really transitioning our customer recommendation engine from household growth to deposit growth and while that sacrificed a little bit on the household growth numbers instead of our typical up or up we were on households but that translated to very strong consumer deposit growth and so within the deposit growth we did have during the quarter of almost billion about was commercial was consumer and within consumer of that growth was in the southeast markets while of that growth was in the midwest so again the retail franchise at fifth third is just performing at an extremely high level and on the commercial side the growth was surprisingly high given the corporate banking book growth within the commercial deposit growth about of the growth was in corporate banking so at that time we were targeting lets get lcr full lcr north of we actually came in at so definitely did better than we initially expected but when we were dissecting the quarter end results it really makes sense that the corporate banking book did better and as fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 one of the sort of hidden benefits of the rwa diet is that were getting better share of wallet within that corporate banking book and that also helped drive the deposit growth so overall a very strong quarter again for us on the deposit side we expect continued growth in the fourth quarter albeit at a little bit lower growth rate but still up a bit in the fourth quarter r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thats very helpful and thank you and then if i could switch gears for just a second the securities portfolio marks i guess you all might come out looking a little heavier than some others but by the same token you guys have been more hesitant to use the htm classification as well i guess just any updated thoughts on sort of how youre thinking about that at least optically would help out levels if not in terms of real world but just curious to hear your updated thoughts james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah if you break it down between real world and regulatory world thats really how we are looking at this in the real world with really the economic risk whenever you have a fixed rate asset whether thats in afs htm or in the loan portfolio you have that economic risk to higher rates we have elected to hold our securities in afs and well continue to do so given that it gives us better flexibility and opportunity to reposition as the environment changes but when you are in the real world managing the balance sheet how we approach balance sheet management is in totality and you can look at our strong nii results our interestbearing liability results any of the measures relative to peers the total balance sheet is performing very well were going to grow nii this year to others are shrinking so our philosophy is paying off in the real world the challenge simply comes from the fair value of a single line item and putting that into capital were not insensitive to how that looks on the face of the balance sheet and the tangible book value per share but we still believe it is prudent to have that flexibility because flexibility has value in terms of the regulatory risk perhaps one of the details that we continue to evaluate is something weve not really communicated to all of you externally is that given the burn down that you have in the presentation and in the significant whether its static rate forward rate youre looking at of the aoci burn down during the transition into the new capital regimes assuming the rules play out as currently written and that burn down is going to happen on our portfolio because our portfolio has structure we have defined maturities unlike those portfolios that are in residential mortgagebacked instruments with convexity and extension risk we know our portfolio is going to pay down and we know that this is going to be very manageable from a regulatory capital perspective when we model the capital impact at a fully phasedin level on aoci the impact on cet1 is about basis points when you reach the third quarter of and thats why we continue to accrete cet1 is to be able to have sufficient regulatory capital for that world and in fact should rates get north of we would still be maintaining a cet1 wellabove regulatory minimums wed be over cet1 in that environment so we feel good about how were positioned how we will roll down the curve and ultimately the regulatory capital its just one of the challenges in this environment with everything in afs is that you have that mark on the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 tangible book value per share that erosion but at the same time should rates fall i think all of you would be very pleased with how much tangible book value accretion we would report in that environment timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp and i could r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co got it timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp scott if i just put a point on the last thing jamie said i mean we believe investors want us to do what is best for managing the business and for recognizing the fact that options have value but if you believe that the aoci mark is weighing on the stock then the other way to look at it is the burn down is accretion in tangible book value per share in the next two years just given that current outlook on rates which is a pretty unique buying opportunity would be the other way to look at it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah i agree all right thats perfect so tim and jamie thank you both operator and your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp hey erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey jamie this first one is for you not to belabor the earlier point but all the ppnr metrics and balance sheet metrics look great and so did the forward look and i guess if you could just explain what happened in the quarter i think given that your portfolio your securities portfolio is cmbs i think investors that know you well expected not as much negative convexity was there something unique that happened in this quarter in the portfolio that where the aoci was that much wider james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp not really it was a pretty vanilla quarter for us where we had cash flows in the quarter of about million we put about million to work of the excess cash in shortduration level treasury floaters when you look at fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 the aoci walk that happened in the quarter the securities portfolio because everything is in afs worsened about billion and if you look at how the fiveyear moved increased about basis points the 10year moved about bps and then spreads widened bps on the cmbs and about bps in mortgage so when you add it all up with the dv01 of about million that gets you to the aoci movement for the quarter on the investment portfolio and so it was in line at least with our expectations with how rates were moving during the quarter erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question was for you tim i think it was a very powerful statement you said in the beginning of the call in terms of confidence that you could return to loan growth next year i think several of your peers that have similar cet1 ratios and similar aoci marks are still talking about dieting could you give us a sense of first of all if you could confirm what the aoci was in basis points jamie and second tim how are you balancing on one hand the market wants you to continue to build capital as we approach that transitional date on cet1 and on the other were still hearing low demand from corporates for financing timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp yeah so theres a lot in there but erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i dont have one more question timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp but thats the right question erika so a few things here one i think we have tried to be consistent in how we confront change or a need for change in how we operate the company and the underlying principle here is that if you have to make a change its better to do it quickly so that you can get it behind you and return to a normal mode of operations so we have been aggressive at building liquidity jamie talked about the fact that we were cat i lcr compliant in both august and september this year and i think equivalently we have tried to be very proactive about how we manage through the rwa diet so we have one additional quarter to go of dieting to hit our rwa target which was about a reduction if you just look at what were expecting in the fourth quarter and from there well have achieved what we think we need to achieve in order to be able to refocus on growing the balance sheet prudently i should say growing the loan portfolio prudently sequentially over the course of the next year we have benefit of a very high level of profitability right now right we obviously dont have all of the peer reports at this point but if you look at the core profitability measures here theyre excellent were generating 30plus basis points of cet1 a quarter which is quite helpful as it relates to being able to both build capital and fund loan growth and then while demand is tepid across the sector we have some idiosyncratic benefits here that probably have been a little bit lost behind the diet in the form of both dividend and provide which continue to perform very well and generate growth and the sustained multiyear investment weve made in expanding our middle market fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 coverage in the southeast markets right the middle market relationships are in terms of the new relationships weve added to the company yeartodate are ahead of our alltime record pace and we still have bankers who are seasoning in in terms of building their portfolios that we have been fortunate to hire over the course of the past few years so those are the things that really provide the catalyst in an environment where demand in aggregate is a little bit more tepid and then the raw capacity in the form of capital generation to be able to support that statement that we can return to growth next year james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and then erika on your other components of the question cet1 for us finished the quarter at excluding the investment portfolio aoci that number would be and then the rwa bloat from the pending rules would be about to of rwa which is about basis points so we would look to be at a level but as we talked about then the earnings power of the company is very strong we continue to defer the buybacks well continue to accrete capital and with the passage of time given the structure in the investment portfolio the burn down of that aoci will be or so by the time we reach the fully phasedin level so we feel that this is a very manageable timeline for the company in fact have a lot of cushion should rates even go higher operator and your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi tim hi jamie how are you guys timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp very good gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc tim coming back to your opening comments about your corporate and commercial customers being cautious and you yourself seeing some of the economic crosswinds or crosscurrents being cautious i noticed yesterday that the real gdp number that the atlanta fed puts out for the third quarter is calling for a real gdp growth in the third quarter its probably too high but the point is there are a lot of crosscurrents can you share with us when you talk to your customers what do you think is going to take them to become more optimistic and less cautious is it a fed halting in increasing shortterm interest rates is it better inflation numbers what do you think theyre waiting for before they really start committing to borrowing more money and growing their businesses fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp yeah thats a great question gerard yeah i think honestly its less uncertainty right so to your point so you have a lot of variables underway here you have the fed and rates as you mentioned you have an immense amount of government spending right now which is propping up economic growth in certain sectors of the economy that otherwise wouldnt be there you have sort of unusual times in the housing market where we have both high rates and still stable or even in some markets slightly growing home prices even though home affordability is at an alltime low and its just i think more than anything else we need to see some of those variables get fixed right in terms of what happens so if the fed stops raising rates and then introduces a cut i think that would be helpful i think that we have to see the last of the stimulus dollars come out of consumer accounts and see what the floor looks like in terms of consumer spending and then i think we have to have a better sense for what the underlying economic activity looks like in areas where the government spending the trillion that are coming out of the various government programs are not driving a lot of the economic activity for people to get a little bit more focused because again what i hear and i went out and i had the opportunity to get feedback from about three dozen clients shortly before the call here is theyre seeing a gradual slowdown that is essentially disposable income theyre seeing disparities on the consumer side between either businesses or take hotels hotel properties that either cater to retired people or to highend consumers in highend destinations continue to do well whereas the mass market properties are starting to soften we hear them on the b2b side being much more guarded as it relates to liquidity and monitoring cash and adjusting staffing levels and just delaying the larger capex investments here and i think an interesting data point as i had the chance to spend a little bit of time with the head of economic development for one of the large states in our footprint and i was asking about the new project pipeline said oh yeah pipelines still robust theres a lot of discussion going on but the time to decision from when theyre initially contacted about a potential opportunity for either a new plant or a headquarter relocation or otherwise to the award in a given state has moved from days as recently as months ago to over days so you can just see the grind down here of economic activity as people sit on the sidelines and wait to get a better sense for what direction were headed in the economy gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you tim very insightful and then on credit tying in into maybe the economic comments that you just made and i dont know if this is for greg and jamie but can you share with us jamie you showed some very strong credit numbers in your prepared remarks and can you just tell us is it better underwriting if you look back to the financial crisis throughthecycle net chargeoff ratio i guess its quite a bit higher than what youre thinking today and then second is it also your customers because of the pandemic and what they went through are they just better managed today from a balance sheet perspective than was the case prefinancial crisis greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 yes its greg its a great question i think its all of the above right i think we have been very disciplined very fundamental about our throughthecycle underwriting for the past several years weve been very disciplined around our concentration in this geographically or by product right so we have a very welldiversified portfolio as a result were not seeing trending one way or the other so weve just been disciplined around that weve been disciplined around ongoing portfolio management right so we are proactive were getting out ahead of issues when they arise we are stresstesting basis points ahead of the yield curve forwardlooking yield curve and weve seen through other cycles to the extent we get out ahead of this and we identify issues earlier we minimize we also have the ability then to bring solutions to our clients right to help them through some of these cycles and so were seeing all of that across the board be it in our commercial real estate portfolio very diverse we werent as aggressive in that portfolio as some other banks were when rates were basis points lower and the same thing through our ci book so its fundamental sticking to those fundamentals staying disciplined both on the frontend underwriting client selection and then staying on top of the portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess maybe just following up on gerards question around the macro and credit tim just if you can add to your comments theres still some concern that we could hit a recession first half of next year could drive significant deterioration in credit quality one how much of a visibility do you have into credit change over the next few quarters where you can safely say thats unlikely and maybe jamie just talk to us about the ability of the cecl model to capture that kind of deterioration ahead of time timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp yeah so good morning ebrahim its good to chat i think a couple of comments so narrowly to your point i think we have fairly good visibility into what the first half of year is going to look like and were not seeing anything at the moment that would suggest that were headed toward credit deterioration in the first half right we talked about it in the script delinquency formation delinquency rates are actually down on the earlystage basis npas are down sequentially and we have a rollforward for you in the appendix the slides which would indicate that that trend is likely to continue through the fourth quarter and on the consumer side just as an example the nice thing about the way that we manage delinquencies is its like an assembly line so you can see in the to and then the 30plus days buckets what youre going to be dealing with early next year and there just isnt anything in there to be worried about with that said the base case were using as we think about the management of the company strategic investments how we manage fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 expenses and otherwise continues to assume that maybe the market is a little bit too bullish on the idea of a soft landing here i mean again you just look at the payroll numbers so and apply a human lens to it so jobs are up but job participation is flat labor force participation is flat and average hours worked are down and unemployments stable what that means is you have more people working two jobs because theyre not getting enough hours or earning enough money at the job that they were working the base job that they were working to be able cover their expenses so when you then look at declining real incomes the only thing that really would be standing between somebody who is having to work two jobs and is still suffering from a declining real income and credit delinquency is the fact that there was the stimulus buffer that built up because people had forbearance on loan portfolios and stimulus dollars well the student loans are back now housing inflation is still very high at i think in the most recent prints and those are just early indicators that that there are people across the country that are struggling a lot more than the headline numbers would suggest so i feel good because the two areas i would say the markets most worried about right now are subprime consumers and renters where we have very little in the way of exposure on the virtually no subprime and i think the lowest level there of any of our peers who provide information on that front and of the consumer exposure is to homeowners and then in commercial real estate where again the our exposure relative to total capital is lower than anybody elses and because we werent trying to grow that portfolio materially were able to be much more selective which is reflected in superior credit metrics right now when you look at our commercial real estate book relative to others so its both smaller and better performing james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah and in terms of how the consumer is doing and what we see in our data the average consumer balance is still deposit balance is still above precovid levels but to tims point renters are back to precovid levels and sub660 ficos are actually below precovid levels so the averages can be a little bit misleading in terms of what credit outcomes may bring in but as tim said were certainly wellpositioned from a credit perspective on our balance sheet and from an acl perspective on the second part of your question the scenarios we use from moodys have gdp contracting almost near zero so the modeling certainly picks up erosion in the forecast in this quarter you had a slight erosion both in gdp and unemployment as well as with corporate profits and that was part of the reason or the primary reason why our acl coverage increased from basis points to basis points its just we had the benefits of the loan balance reduction and the unused commitment reductions from the rwa optimization efforts that offset that ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well thats helpful and just a separate question in terms of deposit pricing as we look through next year and if rates dont get cut in higherforlonger are you observing any differences within your geographies midwest versus southeast clearly youre opening a lot of branches in the southeast so you have a different strategy there i assume relative to the home market just give us a sense of pricing competition any differences and in your fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 view is deposit pricing now essentially natural in nature or is it still localized where certain markets could meaningfully outperform or lag in on the repricing side james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah excellent question ill start and then turn it over to bryan in terms of total deposit costs and deposit pricing the quarter played out as expected with our beta ticking up from a total deposits excluding brokered to we expect that to hit the beta we talked about a quarter or two ago so the pricing is playing out as we have expected and i think most of the banks beta guides are coming up to where weve been at this higherforlonger scenario but in terms of each geography bryan you want to touch on that bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah absolutely thanks jamie in general i think what were seeing is that its a combination of it is local and a national impact right now and what youre seeing is that you may have periods of time where the dominant players or the bigger players in specific markets may just have a lower liquidity need and so that gives you a little bit of an opportunity to be a little bit more aggressive and do well from a share perspective but what weve seen since march is that tends to rotate around a little bit and ultimately as people start to realize as deposit competition is moving in the market youre just seeing people then start to react your most ratesensitive customers are absolutely focused on the national markets they tend to be the ones that are most willing to use a nontraditional provider and so you definitely see some of that but in general it tends to you still tend to have some opportunity to take advantage of some geographic differences but those geographic differences can rotate over time ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator and your next question comes from a line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys i think you guys said in the conference season that the fourth quarter would likely be the bottom for nim and the first quarter of next year would be the bottom for nii dollars just wondering given the guide you gave today if that still foots to that and anything we should be thinking about in terms of getting to that nii bottoming james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah the first quarter the day count is what will drive that nii trough the nim whether its the fourth quarter or the first quarter is going to be driven solely by how much excess cash we have from the strong deposit performance so well see but its going to be one of those two quarters ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 okay got it and then as you think forward how do we understand the benefit that youll get once rates get to a peak about fixed rate loan repricing i think its clear to understand how the securities book moves but on the loan side can you walk us through just how much benefit you might be able to see as we get into next year from that side being able to offset any lagging deposit pricing james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah the consumer book in particular is where most of the fixed rate repricing benefit resides if you look at well have about billion of consumer loan payoffs is how we model it and front book rates are to basis points higher than back book rates and so if you take that coupled with call it billion in security maturities and cash flows you end up with about million tailwind on an annualized basis obviously thatll happen during the course of so take half of that for the inyear effect but youre looking at million type of run rate benefit just from one years repricing ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay if i could just ask one last one the your the swap slide you have just talks about the versus update is there anything different or any thought process different about some other banks have been adding securitiesbased swaps to protect capital and add a little variable rate juice have you done anything like that incrementally or is that slide looks pretty intact in terms of how youre approaching swap portfolios of both loans and securities bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah weve done nothing incremental at this point obviously were paying attention to the market and evaluating opportunities i think more than anything the as jamie mentioned the goal of locked out structure of our portfolio ultimately is our hedge to higher rates right now because we now have those defined maturities that are going to come in and we think that keeps us relatively wellpositioned but were constantly keeping an eye on the market and figuring out if there are opportunities for us to continue to improve our positioning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great understood thank you operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess this goes in the category of no good deed goes unpunished your efficiency ratio of do you think that can improve next year which is another way of saying is there any shot at getting positive operating leverage and when i give the positives and negatives and correct me it looks like from the negatives the rwa diet certainly helps capital but has a cost to nii and i think you mentioned nii not bottoming maybe until first second quarter you have the cumulative beta going up to its in line but still going higher youre opening new branches a year fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 on the other hand your rwa diet will end and maybe you can lean into the balance sheet more you mentioned the deposits the smallest dda increase since march the excess cash which you could choose to put to work so really part of the tailwind is the asset beta relative to the deposit beta so does your efficiency improve next year can you get positive operating leverage is that too much of a stretch how do you think about that james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think itll be environment dependent which im sure is not the answer you wanted but i think you hit on all the right points mike which is the rwa diet makes positive operating leverage difficult in with that said we will do everything in our power to deliver as good of results as we can but i think itll be a challenge in timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp the old saying is cincinnati invented hustle mike so were going to work as hard we possibly can on that front mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just clarification on the credit side did i hear you correctly you have zero office delinquencies zero office chargeoffs commercial you have the lowest inflows to npa since you reiterated to basis points throughthecycle is that correct and i know its been asked already but youre saying the economy is grinding lower doesnt look good so would you just say your credits economically insensitive at this point i mean thats like dont you think you could maybe be wrong if things dont go so well timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp until you got to the last part there i was going to say in a word yes but then you made the question a little more complicated you want to james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah all of those facts are correct and we feel very good about all of the work weve done on the credit portfolio over the last years in terms of it being economically insensitive no but within any industry there are going to be winners and losers and thats where it comes down to that client selection that greg referenced we just believe we are very wellpositioned and weve been very diligent and part of the benefit that were getting right now is the fact that we were not stretching for loan growth over the past several years and have probably had the lowest loan growth guides over the past several years running and so back to our priorities of stability and profitability ahead of growth mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore isi your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 timothy n spence a chief executive officer president director fifth third bancorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning guys just on the credit side i know you mentioned that the new npa inflows were the lowest since the second quarter of excluding the large chargedoff items i guess could you maybe talk about the sustainability of that what are you seeing in terms of risk migration and some of your internal risk ratings and everything that do you think the inflows are likely to remain that low at this point and whats the driver of the pressure is it the areas everybody suspects in terms of cre or is it more on the ci side greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp not on the cre side great question not on the cre side were not seeing it doesnt mean were out of the woods yet were watching that portfolio clearly theres stress in that portfolio but we have so little of it thats not driving and as i said earlier we dont have any geographic or product trends theres not an industry thats driving our npa numbers as we sit here today we have very little from a delinquency standpoint and so again it gets back to how diverse the portfolio is yes i still think weve got some pressure on the 550basispoint rate increase that will flow through to our clients but were on top of the portfolio its why were stressing basis points ahead of the yield curve so we can get out ahead of that stuff and so could it go up a little bit given all the crosscurrents sure but i think were in a great great spot our client selection has been outstanding our throughthecycle very disciplined fundamental underwriting i think gets us through this cycle and so i feel good about where we are today and even if it goes up a little bit its very controllable john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks and then secondly kind of a twoparter do you have i know you mentioned the criticized loans are down in total this quarter versus last do you have the magnitude of that decline and then on the shared national credit side the portfolio of of loans i think over the past year that maybe is down a touch i mean do you or do you expect that youre going to reduce the size of the shared national credit book and also what is the criticized ratio for that portfolio thanks greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah so we reduced the it is about youre right we reduced that portfolio by about yeartodate given the dieting that jamie talked about earlier i would expect that number to probably continue to decline between now and year end our portfolio that snc portfolio performs better than on every metric than the rest of the portfolios so its under from a criticized asset standpoint delinquencies are less than we see in the rest of the book npas are less so it is some of our strongest performing of the portfolio the commercial portfolio fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp john its jamie the crit office loans were what i referenced that declined basis points crits overall were up just a little bit john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks jamie operator and your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia morgan stanley your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i wanted to followup on the rwa diet and the trajectory of rates i guess does it move into the 10year impact how you manage that so from here we get the 10year moving up or down does that impact how you will manage loans and as we look into next year what would cause you to maybe lean into loan growth and what would cause you to peel back is it just the outlook on credit what youre seeing there or could the rate outlook impact that as well bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp yeah thanks this is bryan i would tell you that the outlook on rates has a modest impact on how we think of loans but its more about just composition and more in consumer where we may see some additional opportunity or in relative asset classes you might feel a little bit better about some of the spreads in auto youre going to see almost no mortgage production in a higher rate environment obviously and thats probably the biggest implication just given that our commercial portfolio is primarily floating rate doesnt really have a big impact from a floating rate portfolio perspective and it really for us comes down to overall macro how we feel about what the credit outlook is going to be and whether or not were earning adequate returns on the capital were deploying manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then just from a cash perspective it seems like the build was a little bit more than you guided to before i think you had said about billion or so on cash is what you were targeting before i think your target has now moved to billion whats driving the change is it the volatility in rates is it just preparation for lcr or is it also just that you can get on cash and makes more sense to hold cash over securities james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp it was mostly the fact that deposit growth outpaced expectations and in this environment we want to hold excess cash as opposed to doing anything adding it to the investment portfolio we certainly view cash as an asset allocation at these rates as you referenced manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 so it sounds like at some point youd be able to bring that billion down it might not be in the next six months or so but as rate volatility improves you might be able to bring that down james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i would say that our balance sheet is elevated due to a couple of reasons one the unrealized losses whether you have it in afs or htm you do have to fund those losses in your liquidity buffers and so should those losses come down that certainly frees up cash to shrink the sheet or over time as our nonhqla allocation matures we will reinvest that in shorterduration level and also allow us to maintain an lcr above while also shrinking the sheet its just both of those things are going to be measured more in years than in quarters in terms of the cash coming down manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so just as a clarification then does that make you more assetsensitive all things equal now versus say last year james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp were pretty neutral right now how that lines up versus last year probably a little assetsensitive a year ago whereas today were neutral to at least in the disclosure showing liability sensitive manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator and your last question comes from the line of christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning i know you mentioned a little bit about credit in previous questions but generally speaking is the criticized and classified numbers going to be within a certain band in the next several quarters or do you see them rising more than that greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah i would say steady based on what were seeing now from the delinquency and npa all the above and ongoing portfolio we in the last months we have rerated 95plus percent of the portfolio so based on all of that underwriting or reunderwriting if you will im expecting steady christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc and if it went higher than you think that would obviously drive more provisions and obviously more reserve build next year just all things being equal is that fair fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 19oct2023 james c leonard a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure yeah greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp sure christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for all the background and
