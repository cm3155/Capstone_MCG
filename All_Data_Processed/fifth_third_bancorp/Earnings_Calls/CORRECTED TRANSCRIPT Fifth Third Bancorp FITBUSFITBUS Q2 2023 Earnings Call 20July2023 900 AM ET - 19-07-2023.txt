fifth third undertakes no obligation to update them following prepared remarks by tim and jamie we will open the call up for questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 with that let me turn it over to tim timothy n spence president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thanks chris and good morning everyone before we get to the quarter id like to welcome our new chief credit officer greg schroeck to the call greg has been a part of fifth third for years and during that time hes seen more than a few credit cycles he previously held leadership roles in both credit risk and the line of business including serving as our chief commercial credit officer for several years and as our head of leasing assetbased lending and structured finance were fortunate to have him as part of the fifth third executive team despite heightened market volatility over the past four months fifth third has delivered consistent top quartile financial results while investing strategically to position the bank for the long term our operating priorities have been and continue to be stability profitability and growth in that order earlier today we reported second quarter earnings per share of excluding items noted in the release a increase compared to the yearago quarter adjusted revenue increased reflecting our diverse fee sources and resilient balance sheet expenses increased excluding items noted in the release and credit quality was strong with net chargeoffs and early stage delinquencies remaining below normalized levels our key return metrics improved even as we increased our capital levels and credit reserves we generated an adjusted return on assets of over an adjusted return on tangible common equity excluding aoci of and an efficiency ratio below for the quarter these will be important bellwether metrics for all banks as we adapt to impending regulatory changes deposits continue to be in focus for the entire sector in the second quarter fifth thirds total periodend deposits increased sequentially and increased yearoveryear as compared to a decline for the h8 over the same period our consumer banking and commercial banking business segments both generated periodend deposit growth given the yearoveryear decline in deposits systemwide its reasonable to ask how fifth third has continued to outperform the answers are deliberate multiyear strategies to expand distribution in our southeast markets to launch innovative operational depositoriented solutions like momentum banking and our treasury management offerings and our sustained focus on primary household growth weve added over de novo branches in our southeast footprint since more than any other bank except jpmorgan as a portfolio these branches are outperforming their original business cases on deposit production with several producing at a rate of to of plan in consumer we generated yearoveryear net household growth of once again this quarter continuing a strong multiyear trend and punctuated by yearonyear growth in the southeast and continued success in our momentum banking product in commercial we have added a record number of new quality middle market relationships this year up from our embedded payments business newline has also been a strong catalyst for deposit growth we expect the environment in the back half of the year to remain highly competitive for deposits while we will continue to protect our house relationships and manage to a strong and stable liquidity profile we will not match irrational pricing competition in a way that prioritizes headline growth over profitability turning to pending regulation we are taking steps to adapt our balance sheet in anticipation of higher capital and liquidity requirements across the industry we finished the second quarter with a cet1 ratio of having accreted around basis points of capital from retained earnings over the course of the past year we are balancing three capital priorities continuing to build capital at an accelerated pace supporting a dividend increase fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 in the third quarter subject to board approval and supporting clients to drive organic growth we will continue to pause share repurchases until the final capital rules are published and new capital targets are established we are also taking several actions to boost onbalance sheet liquidity and optimize returns including reducing our indirect auto lending origination volumes by approximately through the exit of noncore states trimming outsized lines and closely evaluating select areas of our corporate banking business while we acknowledge the markets more optimistic outlook we remain vigilant on the potential for a recession in our commercial clients continue to perform well but they are being cautious by slowing their growth plans many are closely watching the impact that regulation may have on credit availability and pricing consumers have held up well in aggregate but there has been a divergence between homeowners who were able to lock in historically low mortgage rates and renters who have had to face persistent inflation in their largest monthly expense compared to three years ago homeowners in our deposit base have maintained strong deposit balances whereas renters deposit balances are down meaningfully i want to thank our nearly employees for their unwavering commitment to serving clients and our communities last year you volunteered more than hours to community organizations and you provided leadership to roughly notforprofit boards due to your hard work we have already delivered nearly billion of our 10year billion commitment to provide affordable housing access to essential services and renewable energy in june we celebrated fifth thirds 165th anniversary given the current pace of technological and regulatory change and the logical questions about market structure and competitive models that follow it was an interesting time to reflect on our history and what it could tell us about this moment since fifth thirds founding in the company has withstood a civil war two world wars two global health pandemics and recessions the company adapted its business model to take advantage of technological innovations including the telephone electric light bulbs the automobile and the internet we were an early adopter of the wire and ach windows anchored the rollout of the credit card networks in the midwest invented the networked atm and were one of the initial launch banks for zelle we witnessed the creation of the occ the federal reserve and the fdic and have continued to thrive through many different regulatory regimes i believe that companies that stand the test of time to develop a character of their own that extends beyond the people who work there fifth thirds character is rooted in hard work ingenuity and insistence on excellence and a sense of responsibility for the communities we serve im as confident as ever in fifth thirds positioning our ability to outperform through the cycle and to deliver innovations that improve lives for all our stakeholders and frankly im just thankful to be part of the team that will steward the bank into the future with that ill now hand it over to jamie to provide more details on our financial results and outlook james c leonard executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thank you tim and thank all of you for joining us today our second quarter results were once again strong despite the market headwinds we achieved an adjusted efficiency ratio of just below which is a fourpoint improvement compared to the prior quarter our second quarter adjusted ppnr grew more than compared to both the prior quarter and yearago quarter driven by the continued diversification and growth of our fee revenue streams combined with disciplined expense management throughout the bank net interest income of approximately billion increased yearoveryear but did decline sequentially our sequential nii performance was the result of our deliberate actions to grow onbalance sheet liquidity to fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 support a defensive balance sheet position given the uncertain macroeconomic outlook and tightening liquidity conditions interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points to which represents a cycletodate beta of on interestbearing deposits which includes the impact of cds adjusted noninterest income increased compared to the yearago quarter with increases in mortgage fee income and commercial banking revenue partially offset by a decline in deposit service charges due to the impact of earnings credits from higher market rates and the elimination of our consumer nsf fees in july of last year adjusted noninterest expense increased compared to the yearago quarter as elevated compensation and benefits expense was driven by nonqualified deferred compensation costs the minimum wage increase that went into effect in july of and continued investment in dividend finance additionally expenses increased from higher technology and communications expense and the impact of the increased fdic assessment that began in january excluding the impacts of nonqualified deferred compensation which are offset by a grossup in securities gains the fdic assessment increase and incremental expense growth from dividend finance total underlying expenses increased approximately compared to the yearago quarter moving to the balance sheet total average portfolio loans and leases were stable sequentially in both commercial and consumer portfolios due to our continued discipline with respect to client selection and optimizing returns and also reflecting softening demand the periodend commercial revolver utilization rate of decreased compared to last quarter ci balances were flat compared to the prior quarter as strong middle market loan production and muted payoffs were offset by the lower revolver utilization corporate banking production was also tempered due to our focus on optimizing returns on capital in this environment and lower customer demand average total consumer portfolio loan and lease balances reflected growth from dividend finance offset by declines in indirect auto and residential mortgage average total deposits were flat compared to the prior quarter as increases in cds and interest checking balances were offset by a decline in demand deposits by segment consumer deposits increased and commercial deposits decreased while wealth and asset management deposits declined reflecting the impact of tax payments as well as clients alternative investment options june activity reflected continued momentum such that periodend total deposits were up compared to the prior quarter notably we have grown deposits since the end of last june compared to a decline for the top banks as shown in the feds h8 data moving to credit as tim mentioned credit trends were stable with our key credit metrics remaining below normalized levels the net chargeoff ratio of basis points increased basis points compared to the prior quarter the npa ratio of basis points was up basis points compared to the prior quarter in consumer we have focused on lending to homeowners which represents of our consumer portfolio we have also maintained one of the lowest overall portfolio concentrations in nonprime consumer borrowers among our peers fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 in commercial we have maintained the lowest overall cre concentration as a percent of total loans relative to peers for many years within cre we have limited office exposure with a low and improving criticized asset ratio and almost no delinquencies we continue to watch office closely and believe the overall impact on fifth third will be limited we had deemphasized office even before the pandemic and we are not currently pursuing new office cre originations from an overall credit management perspective we have continually improved the granularity and diversification of our loan portfolios through a focus on generating and maintaining highquality relationships as many of you know we have been and remain cautious in our economic outlook we tightened underwriting standards during covid including stressing credits to an up basis points scenario off the forward curve which limited our growth but improved the stability of our balance sheet since we began tightening underwriting standards roughly of our commercial portfolio has been re underwritten our criticized assets have been stable over the past several quarters across all loan categories we continue to closely monitor exposures where inflation and higher rates may cause stress moving to the acl our reserves increased million reflecting the impacts of dividend finance and moodys macroeconomic forecast which eroded slightly the acl ratio increased basis points sequentially as you know we incorporate moodys macroeconomic scenarios when evaluating our allowance the base economic scenario from moodys assumes the unemployment rate reaches while the downside scenario incorporates a peak unemployment rate of we maintained our scenario weightings of to the base and to each of the upside and downside scenarios moving to capital our cet1 ratio increased basis points sequentially ending the quarter at over our capital position reflects our ability to build capital quickly through our strong earnings generation our tangible book value per share excluding aoci increased compared to the yearago quarter we continue to expect a meaningful improvement in our unrealized loss position assuming the forward curve plays out resulting in approximately of our current loss position accreting back into equity by the end of and approximately by the end of looking forward we expect to build capital at an accelerated pace given our rwa optimization initiatives and by extending our share buyback pause as tim mentioned we will postpone repurchases until we have more clarity on the regulatory environment in order to determine the new level of required capital dollars assuming we do not buy back shares through the yearend we would anticipate accreting capital such that our cet1 ratio ends this year at or above moving to our current outlook we expect fullyear average total loan growth between and which reflects our cautious outlook on the economic environment and our decision to proactively adapt our balance sheet to the new regulatory regime we expect total commercial loans to increase in the lowsingle digits area compared to which implies a decline in the second half of the year relative to the first half this outlook assumes the revolver utilization rate of in the second quarter remains stable throughout the remainder of our commercial loan outlook also assumes that we meaningfully reduce originations in certain areas of the commercial franchise predominantly in the corporate bank to meet our higher riskadjusted return thresholds while continuing to increase originations in our core middle market business we expect total consumer loans to be stable to down slightly from reduced originations of the loweryielding out offootprint auto and specialty lending channels combined with portfolio residential mortgages partially offset by fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 growth from dividend finance we currently expect to originate approximately billion in dividend loans for this year which is a modest decrease from our previous expectations we continue to expect to grow deposits in the back half of assuming stable or even slightly tighter market liquidity conditions consistent with our track record over the past year of taking market share and maintaining high levels of core operating relationships in both consumer and commercial within that we continue to expect migration from dda into interestbearing products throughout the remainder of with the mix of demand deposits to total core deposits declining from in the second quarter to by yearend as we discussed last month for the third quarter of we expect average total loan balances to decline to sequentially with commercial down in the lowsingle digits area and consumer stable to slightly down we expect average deposits to be up on a sequential basis impacted by our strong finish to the second quarter some seasonal uplift and the benefits of our multiyear investments in the franchise that tim discussed earlier shifting to the income statement we estimate fullyear nii will increase to consistent with our comments from the midjune investor conference our nii guidance assumes a cumulative beta of by the fourth quarter assuming an additional basis point rate hike in july and no further rate movements in our outlook translates to total interestbearing deposit costs increasing around basis points in the third quarter and another basis points or so in the fourth quarter our guidance assumes that our securities portfolio balances remain relatively stable between now and yearend as a byproduct of our strong deposit growth combined with lower loan growth and stable securities balances we expect to hold closer to billion in cash and cash equivalents by yearend we expect our loantocore deposit ratio to end the year in the mid area which will keep fifth third in a strong liquidity position in anticipation of more stringent regulatory requirements we expect third quarter nii to be down approximately to sequentially due to the continued impacts of the balance sheet dynamics i mentioned we expect adjusted noninterest income to be stable in resulting from continued success increasing market share due to our investments in talent and capabilities with stronger gross treasury management capital markets wealth and asset management and mortgage servicing revenue to be offset by higher earnings credit rates on treasury management subdued leasing remarketing revenue and a reduction in other fees due to lower tra and private equity income this year we expect our fourth quarter tra revenue to decline from million in to million in we expect third quarter adjusted noninterest income to be down to compared to the second quarter we expect to continue generating strong revenue across most fee captions which we conservatively assume will be more than offset by a slight erosion in debt capital markets and mortgage revenue reflecting the environmental headwinds as well as lower other noninterest income we continue to expect fullyear adjusted noninterest expenses to be up to compared to if capital markets fees improve relative to our current expectations we will likely land at the upper end of the range our expense outlook incorporates the fdic insurance assessment rate change that went into effect on january the marktomarket impact on nonqualified deferred compensation plans which was a reduction in expenses but an increase in and the fullyear impact of investments to grow the dividend finance and provide businesses excluding the fdic assessment and nqdc impacts we would expect our fullyear core expenses to be up fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 our guidance reflects continued investment in our digital transformation which should result in technology expense growth in the lowdouble digits for the year we also expect marketing expenses to increase in the mid to highsingle digits area our guidance also factors in the run rate benefits from the severance expense recognized in the first half of the year which reflected proactive actions taken to reduce ongoing expenses given the operating environment we expect third quarter adjusted noninterest expenses to decrease to compared to the second quarter in total our guide implies fullyear adjusted revenue growth of to this would result in an efficiency ratio around for the full year we expect fullyear total net chargeoffs to continue to be in our previously stated basis point to basis point range however as you would expect with normalizing credit costs in this environment from record low levels there may be a little lumpiness in ci in the second half such that total bancorp third quarter losses are expected to be basis points to basis points and then fourth quarter losses improving relative to the third quarter given our reduced loan growth outlook we expect a lower quarterly build to the acl in the million to million range assuming no significant changes in the underlying moodys economic scenarios this considers strong production from dividend finance of around million in the third quarter which as you know carries a higher reserve level in summary with our proactive balance sheet management disciplined credit risk management and commitment to delivering strong performance through the cycle we believe we are wellpositioned to continue generating long term sustainable value for our customers communities employees and shareholders with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa given the time we have this morning we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions operator please open the call up for qa fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler your line is open scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp morning scott scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning jamie the first question i wanted to ask is on nii i think if ive done the math correctly the fourth quarter nii could kind of level out even at the low end of the range it could kind of level out or at least really slow the rate of decline and i guess in your view what would allow nii to find a bottom at that point i guess i ask specifically in the context of you all having been about the most conservative out there on your funding cost outlook for the second half of the year james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah scott thanks for the question it really comes down to the rate environment with the fed in our forecast the assumption being that the fed reaches and holds and therefore by the end of the fourth quarter weve gotten through all of the repricing lag that would occur so that right now the third quarter guide is down to and then the fullyear guide implies a little bit of a stepdown from third quarter into fourth quarter and then well see what holds when we get there implicit in the guide is an increase in our deposit costs so that the terminal beta is and i guess coming out of listening to some of the other earnings calls the one comment we would have is that our june like everyone elses was quite strong and could and i think to the point youre headed could result in better nii outcomes than what our guide reflects but from our standpoint spotting one robin doesnt make it spring and therefore were going to continue to be cautious in the outlook and play defense in this environment weve got a long way to go from the liquidity conditions tightening with qt at billion a month trillion or more of treasury issuance the student loan repayments kicking back in and then the competitive dynamics that were seeing across the footprint so were going to play good defense and we think defense wins championships in this environment scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thank you and then i think to take a tack one that you might have addressed toward the end of your prepared comments but as it relates to the reserving needs which look less in the second half in aggregate than in the first half no change to the reserving needs for dividend right i think you mentioned thats just due to the slower anticipated commercial growth fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp correct in that the dividend reserve coverage ratio were assuming remains in that area the reduction in the guide for the acl build is driven by all of the loan production changes that we are forecasting with the rwa diet and reducing the balance sheet for the new capital regimes thatll be forthcoming scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay good thank you very much i appreciate it operator and your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from ubs your line is open timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning my first question is for jamie according to your first quarter q for down basis points parallel i believe your nii would be up basis points over a full year a lot of investors are now thinking about the potential for a fed rate cut in so im wondering as we think about that exit rate in nii all else equal do you expect relative stability in nii if in the scenario as the fed cuts and how does that play out in terms of deposit costs in other words is there an absolute level where deposit costs dont move that much do deposit costs continue to increase even in the first few cuts you are one of the most trusted cfos out there so it would be interesting to hear your perspective on all of that james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp well now youve just given me publicity that im going to have to live up to erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc totally james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp giving you a nii guide erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc im trying im trying fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp theres no question that bryan and i have positioned the balance sheet to be currently neutral to benefiting for the rate cuts when the rate cuts ultimately occur the down rate scenarios continue to be the most difficult for a bank earnings profile to manage as credit costs would ramp up and recession kicks in so for us i believe that the deposit cost pressures will mitigate as the fed begins a cutting cycle we just dont see that happening this year which is why the guide on nii is what it is that we continue to expect a competitive environment but should the fed move to the cuts we really like how the balance sheet is positioned for that environment our guide the exit run rate on fourth quarter nii if you took our guide and multiplied it by its about where consensus is for so i dont think theres necessarily a gap at this point in time but is a very long way from july erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc understood and my second question maybe is for tim it took a lot of years of hard work but fifth third has put itself in a position where youre pretty down the middle in terms of the results youre not talking about taking expenses down next year youre not talking about rwa mitigation and while im sure theres something on lcr and longterm debt as those requirements come in that youre working on that doesnt seem to be something that would change strategy the question really here is as you think about where fifth third is positioned and there seems to be now appreciable differences on how peers are positioned for this sort of new world order how are you going to take advantage of it from a market share perspective timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah thats a good question erika and i appreciate it i will say i think all of the things that you described the rwa diet a continuous focus on expenses thinking about liquidity profile and in particular the value of different sorts of deposits in the new world are all things were doing here today but we have the benefit of having made multiyear investments in either asset classes or in particular on the operational deposit side of the equation that are benefiting us in this environment and theyre going to continue to be very valuable going forward i think narrowly the hardest thing on an organization if youre trying to deliver predictable longterm results is to have to move into a bingepurge mode right and whether that is outsized growth followed by shrinking or letting expenses run up followed by deep cuts later it creates two things happen one the first thing that people cut tends to be the last thing that came in the door and the byproduct of that is your cuts end up being concentrated in the areas you are investing for future growth one two your people actually become more reticent to stretch and to try to achieve better outcomes because they dont want to get outsized and have to work backwards so i think what the advantage were going to have next year and the year after that and the year forward is our ability to be consistent about investing in the franchise and thatll mean that we stay on the pace that weve been on the last several years in building branches it will mean that we continue to add to the middle market teams because i think the economics of these middle market banking relationships are going to continue to be excellent regardless of what happens to capital and liquidity and were going to continue to focus on having the best retail deposit franchise and best treasury management franchise in our peer group fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi morning timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the back to the loan loss reserve just to clarify the million to million build per quarter in the back half for dividend finance is that again is for growth expected in dividend finance but its no change in the reserve ratio that youre assigning to that business james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah and let me clarify one thing from what you said that just to make sure were on the same page our guide for the acl is for the total bancorp balance sheet however the primary driver of that acl build is dividend dividend we expect to do million a quarter of production that reserve rate ballpark it in the range but the rest of the balance sheet as we discussed in the guide is actually going to from a loan standpoint is actually going to be down a bit and so the net of those growing dividend shrinking other parts of the balance sheet inclusive of auto where we exited the states west of the mississippi but for texas combined with our efforts in shrinking the corporate banking book will result in a lower acl build than what weve been running at this year because those other businesses will essentially be reducing the acl coverage due to lower volumes whereas dividend call it in that same area but the net effect is lets call it a build of million to million a quarter going forward john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay no that helps a lot and then separately on the credit front can you just talk a little bit about your ci portfolio and how thats been performing just as weve started to see some larger bankruptcies develop but curious how the book is performing on the ci side and i know you mentioned that commercial book has been reunderwritten how does that typically work with shared national credits i know theyre about of your book so how does the reunderwriting work through that portfolio james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 yeah let me start and then ill turn it over to greg schroeck to add a little bit more color but in terms of as we discussed in the outlook we continue to have a total bancorp chargeoff guide in the basis point to basis point range within commercial over the past couple of years its obviously bounced around from bps in down to bps in and bps last year and this year on commercial we continue to be in that basis point to basis point range and then within total commercial ci is expected to be at the high end of that range given some of the lumpiness that were seeing with a few credits that resulted in a little bit of that uptick in the npa ratio at the end of the quarter but with that ill turn it over to greg for thoughts on ci underwriting and other views greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah i agree with jamie first of all the portfolio monitoring really doesnt change whether its a snc middle a ci loan regardless we have a robust portfolio management structure and discipline in place that keeps us out ahead of these emerging trends were really not seeing significant negative trends in that ci book were not seeing it certainly in the shared national credit book so i still feel really good about the middle market as jamie said were going to have some lumpiness youve probably seen our guidance into the third quarter from a chargeoff perspective the headline there i think is twofold a were starting from a very low base and so because of that low base one or two loans can move the needle and thats exactly what happened right weve got two credits one in the professional services industry and the other in the manufacturing that are going to move the needle in the third quarter but overall i feel really good about the portfolio and i would expect fourth quarter chargeoffs to be back in line with what we saw in the first and second quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi very helpful thank you so much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys hey i just wanted to ask on the securities book i know you guys do daily lcr calcs and you got still the twothirds portfolio in the locked out and bulleted as you contemplate what the lcr requirements might look like and i know were going to learn that soon do you think are you comfortable with the structure of the portfolio and meeting any pushdown requirements to category iv james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah ken great question and embedded in all of our comments and outlook today we should have outlined the strategy that our approach here for our company is that we fully expect tlac to get pushed down we expect the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 more draconian capital rules on ops risk to get pushed down but not any of the benefits from the credit risk weightings and we expect to have to be compliant with the full lcr so that is the underpinning of all of our strategies for managing the balance sheet and we want to do that expeditiously and therefore we are going to be holding higher levels of cash we will be rotating more into level securities but we love the bullet locked out structure because that provides the shock absorber to potential lowrate environment and so the flip side to all of this will be the aoci impacts with the capital rules and so well wait to see what those final rules look like but it sounds like obviously afs inclusion htm exclusion and so we may have to pivot a bit on the htm classifications given that weve not done anything to date but that might be an outcome from the brave new world that we will have to adapt to ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc right and i guess in the near term with rates high the move to cash is actually helpful right because youre now earning five and change versus the average yield of the book which seems like its kind of just held in so its fair to say that thats kind of what we expect to see as the securities book for now just continues to shrink back down and as to your point we just see that cash build continue james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah what we did in the second quarter was we let the portfolio cash flows of million roll off and not get reinvested so essentially to your point bolster cash for the rest of the year were assuming stable give or take billion we may let it run down we may rotate into treasuries just depending on the day and the opportunities but what you should expect from us is continued rotation in the level whether cash or treasuries ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and if i can ask one quick one in terms of your deposit growth outlook in the higher beta assumptions i know you talked about yearoveryear household growth i guess can you parse out deposit growth just coming from the franchise as opposed to pricing up to get it james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes its just that there is a several factors impacting that so in terms of consumer on the household side we do have very strong and consistent growth of but offsetting that tailwind is the headwind from the consumer spending and the declines in the average deposit balance so when you look at the consumer the average deposit is still higher than precovid levels but it is down from the covid average balance peaks and so were modeling that that erosion does continue and therefore it creates a little bit of a headwind so for us the majority of the growth is obviously coming from the southeast de novo markets and theyre growing at rate but the midwest whether its samestore sales or the total midwest networks growing households at so we like what weve been able to do and i would say its more about core new customer acquisition than anything else ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah okay thanks for all the color jamie appreciate it fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning how are you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp very good ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess just first question around reserves and less to do with the mechanics of dividend finance and the acl but when we think about the base case jamie that you mentioned i think if i heard you correctly you said that had an unemployment rate of philosophically i guess tim like in the past youve talked about could be worse in terms of credit maybe we do get a delayed recession so just give us a marktomarket around your operating outlook over the next i guess months to months are you expecting a recession and if thats the case shouldnt you be weighted a lot more to the downside than just the split that you have timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah so let me answer the question about the outlook ebrahim and then i think well go to jamie to talk about the dynamics around that specific acl so look i think our outlook is that its hard to know like we watch the same equity market indicators that you do we see the trends on unemployment we see that signal around inflation moderating and i hear a lot from folks about the increased probability for a soft landing we just dont get paid to manage to a goldilocks scenario outcome here right because for every positive indicator you still have like a yield curve thats more inverted than it has been in decades you have data coming out of the red book that suggests that samestore sales in retail across the us has been negative since the beginning of the year that consumer spending on a real basis so take the impact of inflation out like flat or down in five of the last seven periods you have a negative ism in terms of what were seeing their freight levels whether its exports and imports or the overtheroad stuff here in the us continuing to be depressed like those are not positive signs and if you buy the thesis that what were experiencing today is the interest rate environment we had months ago that were seeing all of that in a world where fed funds was right so at least from our point of view while its very possible that we end up with a soft landing here and i think even if we end up with a mild recession that it is not one thats characterized by high unemployment levels that we still are going to end up in a recessionary environment the last thing i just want to make sure that i flag because i think sometimes words matter is when we talk about an rwa diet where other people talk about balance sheet optimization what were really saying is tightening fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 credit supply and higher risk spreads right and those things have an impact on m2 that compounds whatever gets done on m1 that are the other factor thats sort of lingering out there that i think that we need to take into account as were looking at the outcome so thats probably a long way of saying i dont know any more than you do in terms of where we settle but were going to always plan around a more conservative outcome because if were wrong everybody does well and if were right were better positioned to deliver stable earnings for you james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah and in terms of the scenario weightings we anchored to the distribution because that is the probability assignment by moodys for each of those scenarios occurring so that as you saw in this quarter the scenarios eroded unemployment ticked up about basis points or so on a peak basis in their baseline scenario and as tim mentioned its certainly possible that we have a full employment soft recession but we believe that obviously the reserve is adequate and at basis points of coverage we feel good how were positioned ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and thanks for the detailed response tim just as a followup to that i mean so i guess spreads widening tightening credit is one thing are you also seeing demand fall off like as you look through your commercial customer base both in midwest and southeast weve heard from some other banks where things have really cooled off in the last month or two are you actually seeing that from your customers where they are pulling back around investment spend and activity timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah we are seeing some softening in demand theres no question about that i think in general part of its conservatism on the part of the clients i think and the lack of visibility that they have into what the economy is going to look like months from now i think the other dynamic that we hear from clients is they are saying theyre a little bit nervous about credit availability so theres an interaction effect here that you have to take into account when i was on the phone with two large clients one in the medical field one in the real estate field in the past week and a half and in both cases they had gone out and surveyed their bank groups and there were a lot of hey weve allocated all the capital we have available to invest in the second half of the year sorts of responses that they were hearing back andor real constraints on the way that they have to spread ancillaries so i think there is a dynamic that will materialize here where demand will be lower for credit because the cost of credit will be higher and thats the interaction effect that i think as we roll forward here were going to continue to see in addition to just general caution ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of michael mayo from wells fargo your line is open fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc jamie im not sure if jamie was quoting aristotle earlier one robin does not make a spring but well stick to the aristotle quote so excellence is never an accident so in terms of operating leverage or positive operating leverage i mean you did guide revenues lower by basis points taking the midpoint and you didnt change expenses and thats consistent with the industry it looks like you could still have a shot at positive operating leverage but doesnt look that way a whole lot or and for next year and theres only so much you can do about higher rates and inverted curve but do you think you have a shot for this year how do you think about next year do you doubleup on your expense plans or do you preserve the infrastructure for potential additional growth timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp yeah mike its tim im going to take that one i mean we are working on expenses the severance item that we called out is part of an exercise that we ran just to try to rightsize the resource base here for demand given the outlook in the environment and as you know the primary outcome of all of this investment were making in the core platforms is to bring more automation and straightthrough processing to the business which we think is going to provide a lot of intermediateterm expense positive expense outcomes i think what were trying to do is to manage the expense base and the focus on positive operating leverage around sort of threeyear increments so if you look back over the course of the past three years we have the lowest expense growth its something like half of what our peer group average is in terms of noninterest expense compound annual growth and we were growing revenue at a little more than the rate we were growing expenses during that period i think we have every intention to do exactly the same thing over the course of the next three years what we want to make sure that were doing though is that when we make an investment we finish the play we get the outcomes of the investment and we move on and if you try to correct at the midpoint you run the risk of having started a lot of things and then you dont get the excellence that you mentioned at the beginning the bingepurge cycle i referenced when i talked to erika mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and im sorry the start of the threeyear period now was when timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 i said the last three years we will have grown expenses less than anybody else the next three years we intend to do the same thing we intend to generate positive operating leverage over the next three years mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp the same way we have the last three years mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and then lets just go back to that quote one robin does not make a spring you said june was better but youre not extrapolating that your guidance may be conservative may not be but jamie what is it that you saw in june and why james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah two things mike that happened in june that are certainly opportunities for the back half of the year to be better than what were guiding to but like most things ill give you another quote the beauty is in eye of the beholder so some folks look at the credit spread widening and the ci coupon expansion that occurred in the market and we experienced that as well in june spreads were up a bit were not guiding to continued spread expansion in the back half of the year in ci and then on deposits june was a very good month for the industry whether you watched the h8 or youve heard from all the banks that have been reporting and you see it in our numbers were up on deposits yearover year were up on an eop basis sequentially we had a very nice june from a deposit gathering and new customer acquisition perspective so what were saying from here is we actually are forecasting on an average basis some deposit growth in the third quarter but frankly if you look at the guide on an average basis its about point lower than our eop balances so maybe we do better maybe not maybe it gives us a little bit of pricing power to do better on the beta but with all that being said we just still are cautious about the liquidity environment in the back half of the year and we want to make sure that we prioritize stability until these challenges are behind us and we start to enter into at least a fed pause cycle let alone a fed cut cycle mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last followup just how comfortable are you that your nii guide kind of captures it and is that the kind of entry point for thinking about bryan preston a treasurer fifth third bancorp mike its bryan we certainly feel comfortable with our guide as jamie talked earlier and as weve talked consistently when the fed hiking cycle ends we expect a quarter or two of impact as the deposit repricing lags fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 play out and we still feel like were going to see stability then both from an nii and nim perspective and growth as earning asset growth starts to pick up from there from an nii perspective and so we feel very wellpositioned with the actions that weve taken and the optionality thats going to give us as we manage the balance sheet here but certainly a lot can change from an outlook perspective and a lot can change in terms of what happens in but with what we see right now we feel very good about our guide and what its going to allow us to do to grow into mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp thank you operator and your final question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi tim hi jamie timothy n spence a president chief executive officer director fifth third bancorp hello gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc id like to come back to jamie and greg on credit for a moment greg you talked about and we all recognize your credit is very strong the numbers are very low but im curious you mentioned about how you guys have a very robust management structure that allows you to stay ahead of these emerging trends can you share with us what is that robust structure and what do you mean by keeps you ahead of those trends when you say something like that greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah i think its the ongoing review of the portfolio as an example in the second quarter our team completed a complete review of our office portfolio right and so as we continue to stress that portfolio we take a look at increasing rates using the forward curve to try to get out ahead of where those cash flows end up if rates continue to increase but also looking at the softening rental rates in that portfolio in the real estate portfolio thats how we stay ahead of it were not waiting for covenant defaults were not waiting for borrowers to come to us were active proactive in again stressing the portfolio across the board not just in commercial real estate so we see whats coming i think its one of the lessons learned and a lot of us have the battle scars from the last crisis of being much more proactive staying out ahead of it and then bringing forward solutions to our clients that again that are more proactive as opposed to again waiting for the covenant defaults waiting for something to drop off the table so thats what im really referring to in terms of emerging risks fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 20jul2023 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp the other one gerard that weve talked about in the past has been some of the proprietary systems we have from an early warning perspective keeping an eye on realtime liquidity metrics out of the book that weve learned whether its through some of the abl monitoring that mb was doing that weve adapted as a best practice inside fifth third as well as then what other banks do always with regard to covenant monitoring and other vulnerability assessment greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp realtime liquidity metrics is kind of what jamie is referring to gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup greg you mentioned one to two loans the little pop that youll likely see in the third quarter were those shared national credits and second how big were the individual loans and are you still making shared national credit loans today greg schroeck a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp so second question yes on a select basis we are still making shared national credit decisions one of the credits that i was referring to that could impact is a shared national credit the second one is not operator and we have reached the end of our questionandanswer session i will now turn the call back over to chris doll for some closing remarks chris doll senior vice president headinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thank you rob and thanks everyone for your interest in fifth third please contact the ir department if you have any followup questions rob you may now disconnect the call
