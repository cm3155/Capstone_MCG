please go ahead chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thank you denise good morning and thank you for joining us today well be discussing our financial results for the second quarter of please review the cautionary statements on our materials which can be found in our earnings release and presentation these materials contain reconciliations to nongaap measures along with information pertaining to the use of nongaap measures as well as forwardlooking statements about fifth thirds performance we undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forwardlooking statements after the date of this call this morning im joined by our president and ceo greg carmichael cfo tayfun tuzun chief risk officer jamie leonard and chief credit officer richard stein following prepared remarks by greg and tayfun we will open the call up for questions let me turn the call over now to greg for his comments gregory d carmichael chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning i will focus most of my comments on the actions we have taken to navigate this challenging environment and provide some highlights on our strong financial performance this quarter tayfun will then provide more details related to the quarterly financial results in his remarks in light of the ongoing challenges brought on by the pandemic and the heightened civil unrest resulting from the inequities in our country we continue to prioritize our actions to support our customers our communities and our employees we proactively made over million calls to our customers since the onset of the pandemic to assess their financial situation in total we have processed over loan deferral and forbearance request since the rollout of our covid hardship programs or approximately of total loans more than of those in our consumer deferral or forbearance programs have made one or more payments consumer hardship relief requests including mortgage declined approximately from the midapril peak through the last week of june beginning july we started methodically transitioning our customers from the covid hardship programs to a combination of short and longterm options if the customer required further assistance depending on the product type and borrower circumstances this approach is consistent with our pre covid hardship programs as of the end of last week more than of the consumer loan deferrals have transitioned off the covid programs of which only have requested additional hardship assistance in total consumers who have exited covid programs and requested additional relief represent less than of total consumer loans the decline in requests the high percentage of customers who have made a payment and fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 a small number of customers requesting additional assistance give us confidence in the strength of the underlying credit quality of our consumer portfolio in addition to providing hardship relief we continue to support our customers through the paycheck protection program due to the tremendous efforts by hundreds of fifth third employees we have successfully originated billion of loans benefiting small and midsized businesses which in turn helps approximately employees of our ppp customers looking ahead to client forgiveness request but we are awaiting further clarity from the sba we have developed an automated solution which should help simplify to forgiveness process ultimately we estimate nearly of ppp clients will request and qualify for forgiveness our top priority remains the health and safety of our customers and employees while we have kept approximately of our branches open throughout the pandemic to serve our customers we continue to monitor developments in select geographies given the recent increase in covid cases and we will continue to follow the state and cdc guidelines to protect the safety of our employees and customers we continue to encourage customers to utilize our digital tools during the pandemic as a result we are seeing increased adoption rates with about of all transactions now occurring through our digital channels now moving on to financial results our second quarter performance was strong once again our results highlight the strength of our franchise and our ability to navigate the dynamic environment and mitigate the impact of lower rates through well diversified fee revenues and continued expense discipline we have now generated yearover year adjusted positive operating leverage in seven out of the past eight quarters and grew tangible book value per share for five consecutive quarters we grew common equity tier capital this quarter despite adding to our reserves and paying nearly million in common dividends our cet1 ratio improved basis points to additionally our loantocore deposit ratio reached a historically low level of excluding ppp loans our strong capital liquidity ratios are indicative of our balance sheet strength which will serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment with respect to capital we recently announced our indicative stress capital buffer requirement from the ccar exercise of which is the floor under the regulatory capital rules without the floor we estimate our buffer would have been approximately we also announced our intention to maintain our current common dividend per share and continue the suspension of share repurchases through at least yearend we will continue to provide our board with the necessary information to make forwardlooking and datadriven decisions about the sustainability of the dividend in terms of credit quality the net chargeoff ratio of basis points this quarter was better than the low end of our previous guidance range reflecting improvement in consumer and relative stability in commercial while we do not have perfect foresight with respect to the duration or severity of this downturn we have consistently communicated our throughthecycle principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on longterm performance while economic visibility remains low our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment from a commercial client standpoint we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient balance sheets as well as multiple sources of repayment we have been very successful keeping our client relationships and as a result have generated record capital markets revenue in three out of the last four quarters we believe this composition towards larger relationships will serve us well as our clients navigate the pandemic in fact corporate banking clients representing approximately of our exposures fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 successfully accessed the debt and equity capital markets since the onset of the pandemic to bolster their liquidity including in the covid highimpact industries we continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate an area where we have been deliberately underweight we have focused predominantly on toptier developers with a track record of resilience and significantly lower ltvs compared to the last downturn our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type including virtually no land loans and as we have discussed before we continue to be at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital it is worth noting that across both of our portfolios in consumer and commercial we have focused on maintaining geographical diversification through several national businesses including indirect auto and residential mortgage in addition to ci and cre our credit risk is well diversified beyond our retail footprint through these national lending businesses which will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery in addition to our deliberate positioning with respect to credit risk exposures we have also spent many years preparing for a turn in the economic cycle by improving and diversifying both our key revenues and our loan portfolios which was evident in the second quarter results our ppnr increased from the yearago quarter despite the continued headwinds from lower rates this reflects a record quarter in capital markets strong mortgage origination revenue proactive liability management and continued expense discipline our four key strategic priorities leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation driving organic growth and profitability expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection remain intact clearly in this type of environment we are putting the appropriate level of focus and prioritization on the initiatives within those four priorities which have the highest probability of driving longterm financial success before i turn it over to tayfun to discuss our financial results and outlook in more detail i would like to once again thank our employees i am very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers our communities and each other during these unprecedented times with that ill turn over to tayfun to discuss our second quarter results and our current outlook tayfun tuzun chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you greg good morning and thank you for joining us today before i begin my review of the quarter let me also reiterate that we are very proud of how our colleagues have responded to the many uncertainties that we face in navigating through the challenges associated with the nature of this downturn we do believe that the actions that we have taken so far and those that we will be taking in the coming quarters will continue to display our strong desire to fulfill our role in reinvigorating the economy by maintaining and leveraging our strength to support our clients in managing through this difficult period the data and information that are available to us today continue to indicate low visibility regarding the direction of the economy our discussion today and our decisions during the second quarter collectively reflect our cautious approach behind our decisions on managing risk exposures in this uncertain period as we commented during our first quarter earnings conference call our economic assumptions based on moodys economic scenarios which underlie our outlook including the background scenarios reflected in our reserve build did not and still do not assume a vshaped recovery fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 our downside scenario assumes that gdp will remain below the end of levels until the second quarter of and the base case assumes that it does not recover until the second quarter of also our downside scenario assumes the unemployment rate will remain near until the second quarter of and remain above heading into with the base case scenario assuming that after the current spike and recovery the unemployment rate will worsen and peak at nearly in the second quarter of before slowly recovering this reflects our belief that the downturn will be prolonged and the recovery uneven turning to slide with respect to the second quarter we were pleased with our overall financial performance despite the economic conditions we took advantage of favorable market conditions in mortgage and capital markets which helped us exceed our fee income projections credit performance remained relatively strong during the quarter chargeoffs were better than our prior expectations and the npa ratio increased just basis points sequentially deposit growth significantly exceeded our expectations although clearly a good portion of the inflows were related to the stimulus programs we believe that we can leverage our clients demonstrated preference to bank with us for future revenue opportunities and enhanced client interaction we improved our regulatory capital and liquidity position during the quarter our cet1 ratio increased basis points to above despite the reserve build and exceeds the required minimum including the indicative stress capital buffer by over basis points our loantocore deposit ratio improved to as our shortterm investments predominantly interestbearing cash were approximately billion at quarterend our loantocore deposit ratio was excluding ppp loans the combined hedge and investment portfolio unrealized gain position stands at billion reflecting the growing value associated with the longterm protection that these portfolios provide as a proof point the sequential decline of our investment portfolio yield is about a third of the peer median decline reported results for the quarter included a negative impact from several notable items including a charge related to the valuation of the visa total return swap certain real estate impairments including from our branch network specific covid related expenses mb mergerrelated charges and a debt extinguishment charge second quarter preprovision net revenue improved from the prior quarter and from the prior year as we generated positive operating leverage again despite the rate headwinds our adjusted efficiency ratio improved nearly basis points from last quarter and improved nearly basis points from the yearago quarter return metrics were impacted by our reserve build but we continue we continue to produce strong revenues while also generating efficiencies throughout the company moving to slide total average loans increased sequentially reflecting growth in ci from increased line draws and ppp loans as well as growth in construction and auto loans excluding ppp total average loans increased sequentially given the rather uneven line utilization trends during the quarter the timing of ppp loans we are also providing periodend balance performance endofperiod loans declined billion sequentially or reflecting a repayment of line draws as well as subdued borrower demand in both our commercial and consumer portfolios our commercial line utilization rate was at quarter end down from midapril and essentially flat compared to the prepandemic rate line utilization so far this quarter has been stable commercial pipelines remain generally soft as you would expect and our focus continues to be on our existing client base in this environment average commercial real estate loans increased sequentially reflecting draws on previous commitments periodend cre loans were flat compared to the prior quarter as we discussed many times before we believe that our industry low cre balance as a percentage of riskbased capital which is less than half of what it was fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 during the last downturn combined with the strong risk profile of our borrowers will benefit our future credit results given the likelihood that commercial real estate will be exposed rather severely during this downturn average total consumer loans decreased from last quarter growth in auto was offset by declines in home equity and credit card auto production in the quarter was strong at billion rebounding nicely after the april slowdown with healthy spreads and the same super prime profile as before our average origination fico scores were nearly this quarter most of the other consumer loan categories reflected the generallysubdued borrower demand and consumer spend levels due to both weak economic activity and government stimulus and other benefit programs moving on to slide average core deposits increased sequentially with doubledigit growth in all deposit captions except consumer cds and foreign office deposits our growth so far is multiple points ahead of the peer banks this record deposit growth came from growth in every line of business and was very granular across product types and customer size growth in the initial months of the quarter reflected deposits from line draw proceeds followed by growth from depositors who obtained funding through the ppp overall the deposit performance reflects our strong longstanding client relationships our customers desire to remain extremely liquid in this environment and the lack of significant investment and growth opportunities average commercial transaction deposits increased and average consumer transaction deposits increased commercial growth was welldiversified between corporate banking and middle market clients average demand deposits represented of total core deposits in the current quarter compared to in the prior quarter as shown on slide we have continued to take proactive steps to mitigate the impact of lower rates which should provide additional support in the coming quarters compared to last quarter we lowered our interestbearing core deposit rates basis points while generating record deposit growth more than the highend of our previous rate guidance range and sooner than we expected as a result our june interestbearing core deposit rate of basis points was below the floor of the previous rate cycle with every product category meaningfully lower as we exited the second quarter our total core deposit costs including ddas was just basis points in the second quarter and basis points in june we expect third quarter interestbearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another basis points this reflects a cumulative beta in excess of in addition to the actions taken with respect to deposits we also terminated billion in fhlb advances endof period wholesale borrowings declined sequentially as i mentioned earlier our current loantocore deposit ratio was excluding ppp loans at the end of the second quarter significantly below almost all peers our current expectation is that the liquidity environment will be slow to change we expect that our current loan tocore deposit ratio will remain at or around the current levels at least through the end of this year although we are aggressively lowering our deposit rates we will maintain a strong preference to meet the needs of our clients which we believe will reward us in the long term ultimately we believe that the strength of our deposit franchise will help lower and keep deposit costs below previous lows while growing our client relationships turning to slide net interest income decreased million or compared to the prior quarter the nii performance reflects the impact of lower market rates on commercial loans mortgage portfolio prepayments and the decline in home equity and credit card balances these impacts were partially offset by elevated average commercial revolving line of credit balances and growth from loweryielding ppp loans as well as continued focus on reducing deposit costs and the favorable impact of previouslyexecuted hedges as you can see on this slide the hedges added an incremental million to our second quarter nii for a total contribution of million during the quarter purchase accounting adjustments benefited our second quarter net fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 interest margin by basis points this quarter our nim decreased basis points sequentially although not detrimental to our net interest income elevated cash had a 29basispoint incremental negative impact on our nim in addition to a 1basispoint drag from ppp loans our periodend shortterm cash position increased by times from billion at the end of march to billion at the end of june with periodend excess cash times higher than our average excluding the impact of elevated cash positions and ppp loans we estimate that our nim would have been just above our focus in this environment is on longterm nim performance as such given the lack of attractive alternative investments and the uncertainty on the timing of future deposit outflows we expect to remain in this cash position longer than we anticipated in early june we dont believe that it is in our best interest to deploy any portion of the cash reserves today we believe that there is more leverage in continuing to reduce our funding costs with the help of our strong liquidity position but we will reevaluate our options if the market environment changes in addition to the anticipated longer duration of our cash position our expected nim and nii progression over the next two quarters also changed compared to our earlier expectations as the ppp forgiveness period lengthened which resulted in pushing out our expectations of the timing of the recognition of interest income to the fourth quarter and early next year at this time we anticipate forgiveness to commence in the fourth quarter with about of the nii benefit to accrue in the fourth quarter and the rest during the first quarter of we expect that our normalized nim excluding the impact of elevated cash and ppp loans is approximately and will remain there for the foreseeable future helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition in our investment portfolio we had a net discount accretion this quarter of million as opposed to multiple millions of dollars of premium amortization some of our peers are experiencing as we have always stated one needs to look at both the derivative portfolio where we took early actions with great entry points for longer duration as well as the structure of the investment portfolio to gauge the longterm nim performance the significant impact of our cash reserves and the ppp portfolio during the next few quarters will create some noise but we anticipate a more stable environment past that the third quarter nim is expected to contract another to basis points driven by the fullquarter impact of higher cash positions and ppp loans with nim expected to then recover in the fourth quarter the third quarter contraction is predominantly related to higher average cash balances on our balance sheet as the impact of lower rates is expected to be offset by the continued benefits of our hedge portfolio and deposit rate reductions moving on to slide we once again had a very strong quarter generating fee revenue to offset the pressure on interest income the resilience in our fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved reported noninterest income decreased by sequentially adjusted noninterest income of million exceeded the high end of our previous guidance range by approximately million the strong performance was driven by another record in capital markets as well as betterthanpreviouslyanticipated results in mortgage and wealth and asset management in our commercial business the strong performance was led by capital markets revenue which increased nearly from last quarter and approximately from the yearago quarter debt and equity capital markets both fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 achieved record quarters again reflecting our clients ability to access the market to bolster their liquidity positions mortgage banking origination fees and gains on loan sales were strong in the second quarter up nearly reflecting improved margins originations of billion decreased sequentially due to a temporary pause in the correspondent channel in may as we waited for clarification from the agencies regarding loans for sale that entered the forbearance category mortgage originations excluding correspondent channel production increased compared to the prior quarter our retail originations were up versus last quarter asset management fees were down reflecting the impact of equity market levels throughout the quarter total wealth and asset management revenue decreased from the prior quarter to a large extent reflecting the seasonal decline in tax preparation fees card and processing revenue decreased million or resulting from lower credit and debit volumes throughout the quarter reflecting reduced customer spend partially offset by lower rewards as we look ahead to the third quarter we expect low to mid singledigit growth in processing fees deposit service charges decreased sequentially reflecting lower consumer and commercial fees which were impacted by the record growth in deposit balances as well as hardshiprelated fee waivers granted throughout the quarter given some of the trends that we have seen towards the end of the quarter we expect doubledigit growth in deposit fees in the third quarter moving on to slide second quarter reported pretax expenses included covidrelated expenses of million mergerrelated items of million an fhlb debt extinguishment charge of million and intangible amortization expense of million adjusting for these items and prior items shown in our materials noninterest expense decreased over sequentially and decreased approximately compared to the year ago also due to the marktomarket nature of our nonqualified deferred comp plans our expenses include the impact of a million expense compared to a million benefit last quarter excluding this impact our expenses declined million or over sequentially driven by the declines from seasonal items reduced marketing expense and continued discipline managing expenses throughout the company as we are diligently managing inperiod expenses we are also assessing our longerterm efficiency opportunities we will continue to accelerate our investments in technology and automation as we see permanent shifts in customer behavior and an increased need to reduce our dependence on manual processes in our operations we are also very focused on improving the resiliency of our technology infrastructure to achieve a worldclass network structure as more and more customer interactions are shifting to the digital front we are also accelerating our implementation of ncino in our commercial business at the same time we are very focused on working with an expense base that is more aligned with the muted revenue growth expectations over the next few years we are sizing our targets within that context and approaching this comprehensively including opportunities in corporate real estate vendor management alignment of our sales capacity with market opportunities the size of our retail branch network and more efficient middleoffice and backoffice operations fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 some but not all of these actions will be based on environmental factors we are performing a deeper structural review of our business lines and middleoffice and backoffice functions to identify opportunities that improve the profitability of our company we plan to share the outcome of our review with you in the next couple of months when we finalize our findings and decisions as always you can trust us to be prudent in managing our expenses with utmost flexibility slide provides an update on our covid highimpact portfolios the amounts on this page represent approximately of our total loans and are down from the last quarter excluding ppp loans as you can see the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the first quarter in all subcategories except for leisure travel where we have a rather small overall exposures all to larger operators the total balances on this slide include approximately billion from our leveraged loan portfolio which is now under billion the information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and that we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios in addition on slide we give you a snapshot of our energy portfolio this portfolio is less levered and carries a higher hedge position than the portfolio during the last downturn in oil prices as you can see the leverage in this portfolio is two turns lower with a higher rbl balance and approximately onethird of the percentage exposure to oilfield services compared to our ongoing stress tests indicate that the level of chargeoffs in our energy portfolio under stressed conditions would not meaningfully deviate from the rest of our commercial portfolio nearly of the portfolio is in reserve based structures and we recently reduced our overall rbl borrowing base approximately as a result of the spring redetermination on slide we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios the fico scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over containing fico scores of or higher on a balance weighted basis approximately of the consumer portfolio is secured and as you can see by our fico band distributions our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high primesuper prime space as we have previously discussed we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards specifically on minimum fico scores and maximum ltv levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections turning to credit results on slide net chargeoffs were flat sequentially the consumer net chargeoff ratio declined basis points this quarter following a 12basispoint decline in the prior quarter and commercial net chargeoffs were relatively stable resulting in a total net chargeoff ratio of basis points better than the low end of our previous expectations npas continue to be wellbehaved at basis points up just basis points since before the pandemic the sequential increase was entirely in commercial predominantly in the energy portfolio as i just mentioned we are comfortable with the loss content in our energy portfolio the consumer nonperforming loans remain low we added million to our credit reserves this quarter increasing our acl ratio by basis points to the incremental reserve build this quarter reflected the continued deterioration in the macroeconomic outlook the cumulative increase in our allowance for credit losses since the end of including the day one impact is now over billion fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 as a reference point we compare our current reserve level with a ninequarter total loss estimates within the recent severe stress test runs ccar severe stress test runs our current reserves stand over at over of our companyrun losses and nearly of fed losses the credit models that the federal reserve is utilizing still appear to be heavily influenced by our credit results during the last downturn which results in a wide gap between our expectations and the feds slide provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter higher levels of reserves in real estatebased portfolios reflect the deteriorated outlook in the economic scenarios related to real estate valuations in future periods including the impact of approximately million in remaining discounts associated with the mb loan portfolio our acl ratio was additionally excluding the billion in ppp loans with virtually no associated credit reserve the acl ratio would be approximately our thoughts on the need for future reserve builds are similar to what youve heard from other banks our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise if the outlook does not further deteriorate there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond their current levels any further increases in reserves would result from a higher likelihood of a more severe and prolonged doubledip scenario turning to slide our capital and liquidity positions remained very strong during the quarter our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at over exceeding the first quarter level even as we built reserves given the dynamics during the quarter we are providing you a cet1 reconciliation between net income riskweighted assets and the impact of dividends as you can see dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in cet1 it is important to note that our capital levels are now well above our targets as you may recall our capital target in early was we raised that level closer to about a year and a half ago and we are now above the level as a reminder we had no buybacks in the first or second quarter and our decision to extend that to the end of this year has changed the trajectory of our capital ratios even with buildup in reserves we are ahead of our capital plan and we expect continued strong levels of ppnr to support our current capital levels we will be resubmitting our stress test sometime in the fall with the rest of the ccar banks we have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios balance sheet strength earnings power and relatively modest precovid dividend payout ratio we expect to fare well we believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model despite the difference in projected loss rates between the two models that i just mentioned we continue to show significant cushion in our forecasted capital ratios under stressed conditions our tangible book value per share was this quarter up yearoveryear at the end of the quarter our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately billion which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios from a liquidity perspective we have over billion in total liquidity sources fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 slide provides a summary of our current outlook given the uncertain environment we continue to provide only quarterly expectations until we have more longterm visibility on the economic outlook for the third quarter we expect a decline in total average loan balances in the to range on a quarteroverquarter basis with a to decline in commercial loans and a increase in consumer balances the decline in commercial balances is a result of the paydowns in commercial credit lines net interest income is expected to decline approximately compared to last quarter assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of ppp fees this decline is primarily attributable to the impact of line paydowns in our commercial business as the impact of lower floating rate loans is fully offset by the hedges as well as the funding rate benefits we expect noninterest income to increase 2pluspercent sequentially and expenses to increase about the same part of the expense increase is due to performancebased comp related to mortgage wealth and asset management and leasing revenues that tend to result in higher dollar payouts in addition there are some accelerated expenses in it that are related to our focus on automation as i mentioned earlier we are working on a broader expense reduction target that we will share with you in the coming months that is intended to reduce the pressure on our efficiency ratio resulting from the weak revenue environment and will also include longerterm structural targets total net chargeoffs are expected to be in the basis point to basis point range continuing to reflect the widening gap between the nearterm credit performance and the anticipated deterioration in credit metrics beyond in summary our second quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress weve made over the past few years improving our resiliency diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet with limited forecast visibility we will continue to rely on the same principles disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and a focus on a longterm performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment we fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak revenue environment while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resiliency of our company with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks tayfun before we start qa as a courtesy to others please limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have if we have time for additional questions during the questionand answer period please provide your name and that of your company to the operator denise please open the call for questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey tayfun i just wanted to sort of follow up on the liquidity you gave a ton of good detail so thank you for that and i certainly understand kind of the nuance of the elevated cash balances why theyll stick around but to a large degree these are issues that affect everyone would you say is there anything unique about fifth third that kind of amplifies the order of magnitude so much tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i think the we believe that if weve stayed very close to our clients during the past five six months as we entered this period and our sales force has been in close contact and our relationships are very strong across the board in both corporate banking as well as middle market banking and they are clearly showing a preference to bank with us and to increase the size of their relationships i mean this is purely a function of their willingness to work with us because we are not offering any significant rates to them that they cant get with rival banks so weve lowered our deposit rates well below where we were in the first quarter but i think the strength of our relationships and our sales force coverage is enabling us to maintain these levels of liquidity and we i mean our liquidity levels are significantly higher the deposit growth i think exceeds all of our peers and the increase in our liquidity position is significantly higher than others look i mean i think it doesnt impact the nii we reflect the liquidity profile of the balance sheet and it also gives us many opportunities in coming quarters to continue to deepen our relationships with our clients thats our perspective r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 okay perfect thank you and just as a followup to that i think you said an additional to basis points of margin erosion in the third quarter based on i guess like the fullquarter impact of the higher cash balances and then i believe you said it would recover in the fourth quarter with the ppp forgiveness i know it can be tough to cut through the noise of whats going on with margins these days but ex the benefit of the ppp benefits in the fourth quarter would you expect sort of the steadystate margin to stabilize after the tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp scott i dont want to give fourth quarter guidance at this point but i think what you should rely on is not just for  but also beyond  we believe that level the nim once we are past the ppp and once we are past the impact of the higher cash balances its probably a good sort of target for us r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay great thank you very much tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure operator your next question comes from erika najarian with bank of america your line is open erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch so as we think about a pretty sizable reserve and some of the ppnr puts and takes that youre expecting i guess if the fed rolls forward the dividend income test beyond the third quarter are you confident that your gaap level of prepreferred earnings would be above that run rate as calculated dividend rate as calculated by the fed tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp erika everything that we look at today as well as sort of the outlook that we have in place gives us a lot of confidence that we will have plenty of room erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 got it thank you and the second followup question is im sure a lot of my peers are going to try to tease out this expense reduction announcement but im wondering how will this initiative compare to northstar and how conscious are you of incurring charges given the possibility that this income test could extend beyond third quarter on the dividend tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so northstar was a combination of revenue actions as well as expense actions so we are talking here a focus on expenses only and with respect to charges it is way too early and not necessarily all expense actions would accompany a charge associated with it so i would not necessarily be too worried about that im not saying that theres not a charge associated with any of the expense actions but sizewise at this point im not too worried about it erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator your next question comes from peter winter with wedbush securities your line is open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to follow up on the expense initiative and im just wondering is the thought to bring the expense base down going forward or is the idea just to kind of hold expenses flat in a more challenging revenue environment gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey peter this is greg first off our intent is obviously to look at the opportunities in front of us and the question that was just asked about northstar a lot of the expense opportunities in front of us are very similar to northstar you think about our branch transformation and opportunities to optimize our branch network think about the opportunities around our vendor management the money that we spend in those areas and the attractive opportunities that sit there rightsizing our organization for the sales opportunities there are a lot of opportunities out there in front of us so our intent would be to continue to invest in the critical aspects of our business that weve mentioned before the digitization of our platforms our southeast expansion and so forth we want to continue those investments but over time we would expect to run at a lower rate on expenses and the realities of the revenue opportunities that are out there in the environment we expect to run at lower level going forward fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc great and just another question you guys provided some really good color on the forbearance on the consumer side im just wondering if you can give some updates on the commercial side about loan deferrals coming in for a second request and whats happening there on the commercial side james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yes peter its jamie thanks for the question on the commercial side i think you saw in the presentation if you look at payment deferrals that of the loan balances are in payment deferral the vast majority over of the payment deferrals we had were days in duration but because they started midway through the quarter not many of them have come off so i dont want to give you too much of a false positive but todate weve not had any request for a second 90day deferral in the commercial book i guess some additional color would be that about of our commercial customers that were on deferral have made payments while in the deferral and then beyond the payment deferral information that we provided and in terms of other types of forbearances theres about of the commercial book thats received a covenant waiver peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks jamie operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i guess i have one negative question and one positive question ill go to the negative question first i mean flattish chargeoffs kind of flattish problem loans just doesnt seem accurate and this is not unique to you its an industry question i mean if you didnt have the forbearance if you didnt have a government assistance how much worse would chargeoffs and npas be and it is a question because eventually these programs run off and then bankers have to be bankers again and reality sets in so were i mean i know just in terms of a general question how bad would it be if you didnt have this other support and forbearance james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah so mike its jamie on the commercial side i think what you see is what you get its pretty straightforward and there was a slight uptick in the chargeoffs but it was offset by the improvement we saw on the consumer side and so i think the heart of your question is how good is the consumer in this environment given both the government support plus the support weve given customers that have requested it for the forbearance and payment deferrals so when you look at our portfolio on the consumer side tayfun mentioned a couple of items if you exclude mortgage because those were six months and you look at the nonmortgage loans only have reenrolled in additional hardship relief and through last friday weve had over half of our original deferrals theyve come off the program so i think thats one good data point we initially expected that number to be as high as so the fact that were experiencing shows us both the government support plus the overall health of the consumer is perhaps a little bit better than we expected fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 the other data point i would point you to is for fifth third in particular moodys published a study july and they evaluated the msas most impacted by covid they use number of covid cases population density tourism global connectedness et cetera and the national average weighted by gdp was and this was on a scale up to where were playing golf so lower is better our score for our consumer portfolio is so were better than the national average and so i think theres a lot hard work going on in our consumer portfolio we stopped the 90day offers at the end of june and really were working to move to the top of the customer payment priority and i think ultimately between the geographic diversification we have the overall credit quality of the book you see in the fico scores plus our revamped hardship programs i think were getting a good view that the consumer is doing better and in fact so much so that the second half of we expect our consumer chargeoffs to be below the second half of mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc wow okay and then the other question was billion of securities and derivatives gains i mean to what degree do you expect would you try to bank some of those gains and looking at where rates are and then youd have cushion for more charges for northstar part or more cushion for your dividends or maybe you could do buybacks sooner because you were a little more unique saying no buybacks including the fourth quarter you went the extra step to be more conservative just wondering why you did that and if you might want to bank some of those gains thanks tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i will answer the question about the conservative stance look i mean i think we all recognize that theres a lot of uncertainty and very low level of visibility under those circumstances i think its natural for us to be a bit more conservative and with respect to the billion gain it gives us a lot of flexibilities if there is a need or if we view that the future outlook for rates changes in our perspective such that that gain is better off harvested and deployed for other purposes there are some accounting realities that dont necessarily allow you to immediately recognize all of that gain but it clearly provides a very significant pool of i would say capital that we can deploy going forward at this point given our view were very happy with the portfolios as they stand and we will continue to harvest and we have a long maturity date so we will benefit it but as you stated mike its a rich mans problem and it gives us a good amount of flexibility mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from saul martinez with ubs your line is open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys so one thing im struggling with this quarter with the banks in general its just that the very divergent performance in terms of not just nim but the nii trajectory this quarter and also with regards to the outlook and i mean you guys have been more conservative i think than your peers in terms of managing fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 rate risks via hedging and when you manage your securities portfolio yet obviously nii is under pressure this quarter its likely to be under pressure next quarter so i guess im asking how you think we should see this dynamic as it pertains to you is this really simply a function of you guys just being much more conservative in terms of how youre managing your risks and thats reflected in your balance sheet dynamics and obviously we see that with your shortterm investments and loans so is it really just a function of how youre managing risks right now thats driving that and or is there something else that we should also be aware of that may be more idiosyncratic tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp two comments saul so one is if you actually normalize the nim progress from the first quarter into the second quarter with cash positions and the ppp across all banks youre getting to a much tighter distribution so if you get to how core nim has behaved that volatility goes down significantly from our perspective we have billion in cash and we are choosing not to deploy any of that part just to show a higher nii outcome others have done that everybody has their own risk profile and risk preferences i think what needs to be really more instrumental as we look forward its a long game and our outlook that the normalized nim once we pass through this ppp period and a more normalized level of cash is when you think about it our nim was in the first quarter so with where the shortterm rates are and where the yield curve is a 24basispoint movement between the first quarter nim and our sort of longerterm outlook on nim is a pretty good performance and ultimately again this is just were talking about a few quarters here where things are going to look a little bit choppy but nim is just an outcome and we are have a strong preference in not going after nii boost in the short term that would put us into a riskier position in the long term saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay i mean i have a few followups but ill table that and switch gears to a different topic and i actually want to ask you about your reserving and actually taking the other direction because i think youve been ahead of the curve in terms of building reserves but when would you actually start to think about releasing reserves and i mean especially as chargeoffs start to move up because you have reserved for those for the loans that are charged off and you presumably then your provisioning will reflect new reserves on new growth and any sort of recalibration of reserves on the back book as we reassess the losses there but im curious is should could we start to see reserve releases quicker than people expect as chargeoffs move up or do you think that theres sort of a predisposition for reserves to be sticky and less reserve releases going forward just because of the vast uncertainty in the macro environment so im just kind of curious how we see things in terms of reserve levels as sort of credit normalizes and we get a little bit more visibility on the macro dynamics tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so setting aside the impact of loan balances on reserves clearly if the loan balances decline theres going to be impact of that setting that aside for a moment what we have so far observed is coming out of the first quarter into may and to june and now into july there is more stability in the economic scenarios that are being provided by moodys as well as just overall market expectations fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 my expectation is that banks will continue to watch that progress over the next quarter or two because in order to be able to release reserves you need to develop a confidence on the sustainability of the economic outlook and if the level of sustainability is truly dependable and if economic indicators should give us the confidence the answer to your question is yes at one point we will start releasing reserves but i do believe that we are a few quarters early on that assuming that there is stability we do need time in order to develop that level of confidence saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it thank you very much operator your next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc was wondering if you could just talk about the process of kind of credit risk management more on like a granular basis like at the ground level obviously its been some time since the role of collectors was all that important so just talk about how youre reallocating i would assume some of your resources from originating loans to collecting loans in anticipation of more work to do there richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yes hey matt its richard so if we think about portfolio management broadly the expectation is that the relationship managers and their portfolio managers that work with them are continuously reviewing the portfolio since the pandemic weve increased the frequency of those portfolio reviews weve done specific targeted reviews around industry and geography and products and from those outcomes weve seen some rerating and rating changes and as a result as things slide we move we start to leverage our special assets group and theyve been really helpful at helping us work through problem credits making sure that we can rehabilitate where appropriate and what were doing is we are absolutely reallocating resources from both the relationship management teams and our underwriting teams into special assets to increase the capacity there and virtually all of them have come from inside of fifth third and the people weve drafted have historical experience and workouts in special assets and so were trying to leverage that expertise across the platform but its the frequency of the reviews and making sure weve got continuity from a coverage standpoint from endtoend fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and is the plan that you should be able to continue to do it inhouse reallocating or do you think you might need to staff up with some or partnering with like thirdparties richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp were not going to were not looking to partner with thirdparties we believe we can cover with inhouse resources matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay all right thank you operator your next question from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning greg good morning tayfun gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hi gerard tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc tayfun or maybe jamie on the loan loss reserves that you have established tayfun you outlaid those two economic scenarios for us the downside one and the base case are those reserves set to a mix of those scenarios or is it are they set to the base case scenario and second what metrics are you looking at going forward to see if you need to increase those reserves because of a worsening in the economy james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yes gerard its jamie we do use three scenarios weighted with a baseline and then using moodys one upside scenario one downside scenario that tayfun outlined for you the major economic variables that have the greatest impact on the reserve levels would be unemployment gdp ph hpi or the ones that have the biggest impact on the models and as tayfun mentioned this quarter the build with million in the acl the vast majority of that build was driven by the deterioration in the outlook and then you have the net impact of loan portfolio decline in migration and ratings almost offsetting each other fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then moving over to the higher risk commercial portfolio thats exposed to the covid19 issues it fell as you showed us to billion when you look going forward is that a momentum that you can continue having a drop that much in a quarter and second what percentage of chargeoffs are attributed to bringing that balance down james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yes i would say in terms of the momentum going forward the biggest improvement or biggest factor in the second quarter improvement was the paydown of the defensive draws we saw in the first quarter and that drove a healthy portion of that decline in terms of the chargeoff composition this quarter you had a decent amount of the growth driven by energy and leisure and entertainment as we look ahead to the third quarter i think youll see a common theme with entertainment and leisure perhaps some cre and then obviously energy as it completes its restructure so i would say its a healthy portion of the chargeoff expectation is driven by that covid stress portfolio but again we still feel good about our client selection and the fact that as richard pointed out its a wellmanaged portfolio its just in this environment there will be losses but we think theyll be manageable gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator your next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley your line is open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thanks i think you guys mentioned that some of the lower or the loan balances being lower and the lower nii guidance for third quarter is really driven by at least in part by further corporate line draw downs how much of the excess line draws in terms of balances do you still have outstanding and i guess are you assuming that all those fully runoff or normalize or the line utilization normalizes by the end of thanks tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes ken i think the guidance is based on average loan balances so they really truly reflect what happened especially sort of second half of may into june so the second to third quarter guidance truly reflects that speedy paybacks at the end towards the end of the second quarter its been stable so far utilization rate is basically back to where it was prepandemic but again the decline in average commercial balances is more of a function of what happened at the end of the second quarter more so than the third quarter ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it understood okay thanks and i may have missed this but have you addressed or did you address like this commentary around sort of ex corporate line draws just the general sentiment around ci borrowers like are you building in any expectation that ci or other loan balances actually are declining in thanks fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp theres not a lot of customer demand for new loans ken the market is very muted at this point both for economic reasons as well as for whats going on with sort of the healthcare situation that limits interactions but so far were not seeing a whole lot of activity from our clients ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you very much operator your next question comes from john pancari with evercore your line is open rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc hi this is rahul patil on behalf of john i just want to go back to the discussion around the reserve release and i want to put some numbers around it so correct me if im wrong so youve guided to average loans down to lets say loans are declining looks like around billion of that commercial loans are coming down billion consumer is going up by billion and youve guided to chargeoffs of around it looks like its around million in of chargeoffs so am i thinking about this right that in terms of provisioning in really the main driver of provision will be the consumer new loan growth of billion and basically is it fair to then assume and apply that reserve ratio on that billion of new loan growth and basically that would imply like million to million of provision in third quarter am i thinking about that right tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp one needs to take into account what happens at the end of period so you just have to obviously indeed its useful to look at the average loan guidance but we will when we get to the end of the third quarter we will see where the balances are at that point and if there are zero builds our reserve position will reflect the endofperiod balances compared to and the movement will be compared to the endofperiod balances in the second quarter rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay but i just want to make sure like conceptually am i thinking about this correctly in terms of with regards to provision and this is also assuming that the macro doesnt get worse or doesnt get better its basically assuming a status quo tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah the provision could go down clearly i mean if loans continue to go down and the chargeoffs stay flat then there is a path which would indicate that the provision number on our income statement will be lower so that could happen rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes operator your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc hey everyone this is amanda larsen on for ken can you talk about the accelerated pace of technology investments that you expect what have you learned about your technology during the pandemic are your structural uses of technology not as efficient as you hoped or is it more about clientfacing technology and you feel limited in your ability to service your clients versus peers and then as an addendum if there is any business segment that you can touch on that may require like better tech that would be helpful to know thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good question amanda this is greg first off our strategy and focus on investing in our technology platforms to better serve our customers through product distribution or servicing capabilities hasnt changed and i think weve made tremendous progress as evidenced by the fact that of all of our transactions now go through our digital channels using that technology to serve our clients in a much more efficient way theres more opportunities in front of us and theres an opportunity to replatform our commercial loan system which were going to do that origination system were going to do that theres opportunities to continue to make the whole mortgage process a digital experience and thats rolling out as we speak so well continue to invest in those opportunities in addition to that theres tremendous opportunities i believe when you think about our back office to apply technologies robotics artificial intelligence in that environment in a more aggressive way to take out longterm costs so when we think about our expense base and how were looking forward here where well place our technology dollars to drive the best outcome for our shareholders and serve our customers its going to be the area of automation of our back office its going to be continued automation of our origination systems and its going to be continued automation of our ability to distribute our products in addition to that when you think about the environment were operating in resiliency is extremely important you always have to be on this isnt years ago years ago where you can afford to have your systems offline you have to always be on for your customers so investments in our core infrastructure we dont want to put new technology new capabilities on old infrastructure so its refurbishing our older infrastructure putting our new infrastructure focused on once again serving our clients and making us more efficient going forward in operations amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then can you talk about the outlook for consumer loan growth you certainly sound more positive on the consumer credit performance where do you expect the consumer loan growth to come for in is it auto is it all auto or are you believing in elsewhere fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp no auto i think obviously we expect to see the teams done a fantastic job as weve talked before were a super prime borrower in that space we expect to continue to see growth in auto and attractive spreads in addition to that we expect our mortgage business also in our mortgage portfolio continue to expand as we go forward here card and so forth we dont expect to see much growth in those areas amanda larsen q analyst jefferies llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning greg gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc is there an update on the cfpb issue and is that possible to get resolved before the end of the year gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp first off i wish it was resolved and i do not have an update this is a long cycle process as weve stated through news channels were very comfortable in our position here and willing to deal with that as we move forward here but there is no update is there a potential to get settled sure theres always a potential it could get settled but at the end of the day we want to make sure that fifth third is viewed appropriately and the opportunity to characterize our behavior and the actions that we took proactively i think is very very important to us so no update at this point but hopefully we could solve it christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc sounds good thank you very much for the feedback i appreciate it operator your next question comes from brian klock with keefe bruyette woods your line is open brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning guys fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks for taking my question just one real quick followup i know that you guys talked about some of the elevated expenses from the better revenue production that came in some of your fee businesses and you talked about some of the technology spend as well i guess just thinking about the guidance for the third quarter includes some acceleration of some automation and tech expenses i mean if we think about what a normalized run rate is even before you think about the new initiatives the expense savings that youre going to be reviewing and do we think that a normal run rate i guess beyond the third quarter should be something thats maybe back towards that billion range where you kind of were before is that the way to think about it tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes i mean at this point given the fact that we are spending a lot of time on analyzing the expense base and looking for opportunities for efficiencies id rather not get into the longerterm outlook for expenses but it is clear that our intent is to lower our expense base from where it is today so i will make that statement and as greg said we continue to invest in areas where we believe we need to invest in to continue to grow our company but our intent is to do it in a way with the utmost efficiency in the rest of the company so the focus of this study is going to be lowering the expense base that we are running today and taking it from there brian klock q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc fair enough thanks for your time appreciate it tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure operator your last question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you i have a followup jamie can you tell us on the consumer portfolio where you guys mentioned i think of the deferrals have exited the program where did they go are they all back on accruing status or are they in some sort of workout is it separate from the covid relief programs or were they charged off james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yes so of the loans the consumer portfolio this was through last friday exited went into a new relief program and those programs i think weve got a pretty good approach there where we offer a shortterm program of six months at of your normal payment or we offer with certain eligibility criteria and proof of hardship a longerterm loan modification and so thats of the group and of the remaining group the vast fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 23jul2020 vast majority or so are making payments and are back on track and so one of the earlier questions was just how do we feel about the consumer portfolio and ultimately how much support is out there when we look at our roll rates and our delinquency rates on that core book it is very good which is why were confident in our second half of the year outlook on consumer chargeoffs gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just finally tayfun this may be a naive question coming back to the cash balances if you take out the money from the ppp loans that may have gone into peoples deposit accounts and you take out the line draws that were unusual because of the situation were in today where is all the cash coming from are companies just not spending on capital expenditures and why is there such elevated cash balances excluding those two reasons that i mentioned tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think gerard clearly the inability to use the cash in the shortterm is one aspect of why these companies and its both individuals as well as companies so we expect that some of the natural rundown is going to be based that theyre going to have to spend that cash given their operating capital the other one is i think it is very likely that some of our clients have consolidated their deposits into a smaller number of banks and we have been a beneficiary of that because as we look at the distribution the distribution is extremely granular which suggests that again more of a relationshipbased direction in deposit flows than anything else gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you very much tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp okay operator and there id now like
