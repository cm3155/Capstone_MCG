this morning i hope youre all well and staying healthy earlier today we reported fullyear net income of billion or per share we delivered strong financial results in despite the challenging operating environment brought on by the pandemic we had several highlights for the year we generated record adjusted preprovision net revenue we maintained our expense discipline producing an adjusted efficiency ratio below which was stable compared to the prior year but remains near a decade low where we generate a record adjusted fee revenue including records in both our commercial and wealth and asset management businesses we also continue to generate peerleading consumer household growth of with outsized success in chicago and our key southeast markets while nearly doubling our reserves we generated an adjusted return on tangible common equity excluding aoci for the full year and generated an rotce of in the fourth quarter just as importantly we have successfully navigated the covid19 pandemic keeping of our branches open for business while working closely with our customers to support them during these challenging times through the ppp program hardship relief programs and other outreach efforts that we have previously discussed our efforts have been noticed externally we are recognized by an independent thirdparty as a top performing bank among the largest us retail banks based on our pandemic response for our customers communities and fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 employees also we had the honor of winning the greenwich middlemarket cx award reflecting our commitment to delivering a superior customer experience for and during the covid crisis additionally during the year we published our inaugural esg report highlighting our efforts to generate sustainable value for all stakeholders and just this week we announced that we became the first regional bank to achieve carbon neutrality in our operations turning to fourth quarter we reported net income of million our reported eps include a negative impact from the items shown on page of our release excluding these items adjusted fourth quarter earnings were per share jamie will walk you through the quarterly financial results in more detail in just a minute focused execution on our key strategic priorities and our disciplined approach to credit risk management continue to drive strong financial performance as we recently announced we have taken decisive action to drive efficiencies and improve the longterm profitability of the bank by streamlining our operations including divesting less profitable businesses such as property and casualty insurance while still investing in areas of growth and profitability for example we recently finalized the acquisition of h2c which strengthens our health care investment banking and strategic advisory capabilities we continue to assess select strategic investments and nonbank acquisitions to improve fee growth all reported and adjusted return metrics were solid and improved sequentially in the fourth quarter reflecting our strong operating results including the provision for credit loss performance we expect a positive momentum in our operating results to continue in net interest income increased sequentially despite loan portfolio headwinds underlying nim which excludes excess cash and ppp impacts increased basis points sequentially we expect to generate differentiated nim performance relative to peers in and beyond reflecting the hedge and investment portfolio actions we have taken over the past several years our credit quality remains solid with net chargeoffs of basis points stable compared with the recent quarters also our criticized assets and allowance for credit losses both declined sequentially reflecting our credit discipline and improved credit results and economic outlook we continue to benefit from the diversification and resilience of our feebased businesses in retail commercial and wealth and asset management many of our feebased businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates our robust capital and liquidity levels further improved this quarter indicative of our balance sheet strength our regulatory capital levels have increased for three consecutive quarters as a result of our strong earnings power balance sheet dynamics and the feds temporary suspension of buybacks with the partial relief announced by the fed in december we intend to execute up to million in share repurchases in the first quarter through proactive management we have built a strong and stable balance sheet that significantly improved the diversification of our fee revenue we have done this all while maintaining our culture of expense discipline and demonstrating our commitment to consistent and solid throughthecycle performance our financial performance continues to give us confidence that we can safely and soundly operate the company at significant lower capital levels while our cet1 target remains at we will continue to evaluate the appropriate target capital target as the economy improves were also seeing continued strength in our commercial loan production levels and our pipelines fourth quarter loan production was the highest in and was down around from the yearago quarter but was up over from the third quarter we are encouraged by the recent trends the sequential fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 improvement in almost all regions and all verticals strong production was more than offset by elevated payoffs and another decline in line utilization our middlemarket pipeline improvement is welldiversified throughout our footprint including significant strength in our southeast markets and corporate banking pipeline strengthened again this quarter with improvement in industrials retail health care solar and financial institutions partially offset by continued sluggishness in hospitality and energy based on a strong pipeline of stable utilization trends through the first three weeks of january we currently expect ci loan balances to improve on the period end basis during the first quarter excluding the impact of ppp loans commercial real estate pipelines continue to be well below precovid levels before i turn it over to jamie to further discuss results and our outlook i want to reiterate our strategic priorities which will enable us to continue to generate longterm shareholder value our four key strategic priorities have not changed over the past several years and include leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation driving organic growth and profitability expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection well put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on areas where we see the highest probability of driving strong financial returns and generating longterm value for our shareholders our balance sheet strength diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this environment in and beyond i would like to once again thank our employees im very proud of the way you have continually risen to the occasion to support our customers and each other during these challenging times fifth third continues to be a source of strength for our customers and our communities and will remain committed to equality equity and inclusion for all to that end we made a threeyear billion pledge to this commitment through lending investing and donating including a million contribution to the fifth third foundation our financial results continue to reflect our focused execution discipline and throughthecycle principles we remain committed in generating sustainable longterm value for our shareholders and anticipate that we will continue improving our relative performance as a topperforming regional bank with that ill turn it over to jamie to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook james c leonard executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp thank you greg and thank all of you for joining us today one quick housekeeping item before discussing our financial results for the quarter as youll see in our earnings materials we are no longer adjusting certain metrics for purchase accounting accretion or intangible amortization given that they largely offset and have an immaterial impact on pretax income we hope this will help simplify our disclosures going forward to more easily assess our financial ratios now turning to our fourth quarter performance we ended with positive momentum and delivered strong financial results reported results were impacted by several notable items including a million aftertax negative mark related to the visa total return swap a million after aftertax charge related to our acquisition and disposition actions as greg mentioned the sale of our hsa business remains in process and should close by the end of this quarter fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 we also recognized a million aftertax charge related to our branch and nonbranch real estate efficiency strategies this includes impairments associated with seven branches we will be closing in april as part of our normal rigor on reviewing our network for efficiencies these closures are in addition to the branches we announced last quarter furthermore as greg discussed we reported a million aftertax charitable contribution expense to promote racial equality and we also reported million aftertax from covid related expenses lastly we had a one time favorable item related to state taxes of million in terms of the financial highlights for the quarter despite the nearly 160basispoint decline in onemonth libor over the last months we were able to generate an adjusted ppnr above the fourth quarter of level we generated an efficiency ratio of our operating performance reflected a increase in nii a increase in adjusted fees and a increase in adjusted expenses given the strong ppnr results combined with continued creditrelated improvements we produced strong reported and adjusted return metrics including an adjusted roa of and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of excluding aoci despite growing our regulatory capital basis points during the quarter drilling into the income statement performance the sequential increase in nii of reflected the strength of our balance sheet and deposit franchise we saw a 4basispoint improvement in our total loan yields which was supported by both the continued benefits from our longduration deepinthemoney cash flow hedges as well as million in additional ppp income our nii results included million of incremental favorable prepayment penalties in the securities portfolio reflecting one of the benefits from our strategy to invest in bullet and locked out cash flows approximately of the investment portfolio is still invested in bullet and lockedout cash flows at quarter end and our investment portfolio yield increased basis points sequentially to net premium amortization in our securities portfolio was only million in the fourth quarter on the liability side we reduced our interestbearing core deposit cost by another basis points for the fourth quarter the average cost of our core deposits was only basis points cd and debt maturities also provided a basispoint improvement to nim versus the third quarter reported nim was stable compared to the third quarter reflecting the favorable securities portfolio and ppp income i mentioned offset by the impact of higher cash levels underlying nim excluding ppp and excess cash improved basis points to once again we had another strong quarter generating noninterest income to cushion the ratedriven nii pressure the resilience in our fee income levels continues to highlight the revenue diversification that we have achieved total noninterest income increased relative to the third quarter excluding the notable items noninterest income increased we generated record commercial banking revenue which increased doubledigits sequentially and yearoveryear driven by strength across most of the business we also recorded tra income of million as well as gains from several of our direct fintech investments and venture capital funds these investments generated million of fee income in and we expect continued gains in fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 topline mortgage banking revenue declined million sequentially driven by a million headwind reflecting a decline in rate lock volumes a million impact from our decision to retain million of our retail production during the quarter and million due to margin compression msr decay and servicing fees were unchanged sequentially and will remain challenged in this environment while we did not deliver the mortgage results we expected due to capacity pressures we have seen meaningful improvement in december and january noninterest expenses also increased relative to the third quarter albeit to a much lesser extent than fees adjusted expenses were up excluding the marktomarket impacts associated with nonqualified deferred compensation but is offset in security gains within noninterest income the largest contributor of the expense growth was performancebased compensation driven by the strong performance in fees related to business growth and other revenuelinked expenses moving to the balance sheet total average loans declined sequentially with both commercial and consumer balances in line with our previous guidance ranges commercial loan balances continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates which decreased another in the quarter to line utilization rates so far in january are stable relative to the fourth quarter we currently expect utilization to remain unchanged for the first half of and are forecasting only a modest increase of approximately in the second half of the year as the economy improves average cre loans were flat sequentially with endofperiod balances declining as we have discussed before we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and supports our strategy of lower exposure and our focus on highquality borrowers we have provided more information related to our cre exposures in our presentation this quarter average total consumer loans increased sequentially driven by continued growth in the auto portfolio partially offset by declines in home equity and credit card we took additional action in the consumer portfolio at the end of december to improve our nii trajectory for deploying approximately billion of our excess liquidity by purchasing governmentguaranteed residential mortgages currently in forbearance under the cares act provision these loans are in our heldforsale portfolio as they are not expected to be held for more than one to two years these loans provide a more attractive riskadjusted return than other current investment alternatives our securities portfolio of roughly billion decreased compared to the prior quarter reflecting the impact of paydowns combined with the lack of compelling reinvestment opportunities our investment portfolio positioning continues to support nii in the current environment allowing for patience in investing at the current unattractive longterm rates given the potential for strong economic growth in the second half of we do not believe long duration securities are providing an appropriate risk return tradeoff as a result we do not expect to grow our investment portfolio in the nearterm our unrealized securities and cash flow hedge gains at the end of the quarter remained at billion also our deliberate actions within the securities portfolio over the past several years focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation of a lower rate environment and should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds average other shortterm investments which includes interestbearing cash increased to billion growing billion from the prior quarter and billion compared to the yearago quarter in addition to the loan growth fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 headwinds outside of ppp the significant increase in excess cash reflects record deposit growth over the past nine months core deposits increased compared to the third quarter despite a reduction in consumer cd balances which helped drive down interestbearing core deposit cost by basis points moving on to credit overall credit quality continues to be solid reflecting our disciplined approach to client selection and underwriting balance sheet optimization and the improved macroeconomic environment charge offs remained wellbehaved at basis points nonperforming assets declined million or with the resulting npa ratio of basis points declining basis points sequentially also our criticized assets declined with appreciable improvements in energy industrial and middle market given the solid credit results lower endofperiod loan balances and improvements in the macroeconomic outlook our reserve coverage declined basis points to of portfolio loans and leases with improvement in both consumer and commercial the low level of net chargeoffs combined with the million decline in allowance resulted in a net million benefit to the provision volume our acl decline of million was attributable to several factors approximately onethird of the decline was the result of lower periodend loan balances with the remainder of the release due to both the improved economic outlook and the improved commercial credit risk profile which is reflected in our lower npa and criticized asset levels as is required under cecl our reserve reflects all known macroeconomic and credit quality information as of december while we are not predicting or forecasting reserve releases at this point given both the significant uncertainty in the economy and our loan growth expectations to the extent there would be meaningful and sustained improvement in the broader economy its not unreasonable that reserves could come down from here even if credit losses tick up our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes gdp remains below levels until the end of an unemployment rate higher than the current ending at and declining to by the end of importantly our base estimate incorporates favorable impacts from fiscal stimulus generally consistent with the billion package passed at the end of december but does not incorporate additional relief as currently proposed by the new administration we did not change our scenario weight of to the base and to the upside and downside scenarios applying a probability weighting to the base scenario would result in a million release to our fourth quarter reserve conversely applying of to the downside scenario would result in a million build inclusive of the impact of approximately million in remaining discount associated with the mb loan portfolio our acl ratio is additionally excluding the billion in ppp loans with virtually no associated credit reserve the acl would be approximately moving to capital our capital remained strong during the quarter our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at above our stated target of which amounts to approximately billion of excess capital as a reminder we have remaining capacity to purchase million shares from our million share program authorized by our board of directors in representing billion or of our current shares outstanding as greg mentioned we plan to execute approximately million in share repurchases during the first quarter and should the federal reserve permit banks to continue to repurchase shares in under the current net income test framework we would have around billion of buyback capacity in total for assuming no change to our reserve coverage fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 moving to our current outlook we have provided detailed guidance for both the full year and the first quarter consistent with previous fourth quarter earnings calls we expect fullyear total loans to be stable with on both an average and endofperiod basis reflecting the full year headwinds of commercial line utilization declines from the second half of and ppp forgiveness offset by the benefit of the consumer loans added at the end of and our forecast of billion of new ppp loan originations in average commercial balances are expected to decline in the low to midsingle digits range compared to while consumer balances should increase in the mid to highsingledigits range for the first quarter we expect average total loan balances to increase approximately to sequentially reflecting relative stability in the ci portfolio continued strength in the auto portfolio and growth in residential mortgage and other consumer loans partially offset by a decline in cre given the loan outlook combined with our expectations for the underlying margin to be around reflective of the structural rate protection from our securities and hedge portfolios we expect nii to decline approximately next year and also decline around in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter assuming no deployment of our excess liquidity we expect noninterest income to increase to in which includes the headwind from lower tra income in if not for the tra impact our fee expectations would be for to growth which includes the impact of approximately million in foregone annual revenue associated with our business exits as part of our expense savings program for the first quarter we expect fees to increase the mid singledigits year over year which is a to decline sequentially reflecting seasonal impacts such as the lack of tra revenue and lighter other noninterest income partially offset by the seasonal uptick in wealth revenue from tax preparation fees in the first quarter and significantly stronger mortgage revenue we expect top line mortgage revenue to improve million to million in the first quarter relative to the fourth quarter and also anticipate stronger results in our loan and lease syndication businesses we expect fullyear noninterest expense to decline approximately relative to the adjusted expenses driven by the impacts of our expense reduction program but partially offset by expenses associated with strong fee growth servicing expenses associated with the consumer loan portfolio purchased in the fourth quarter and continued investments to accelerate both our digital transformation and our sales force and branch expansion in our growth markets as is always the case for us our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes compared to the first quarter of reported expenses we expect total expenses to be flat on a sequential basis excluding seasonal items our total first quarter expenses are expected to be down approximately to from the fourth quarter we currently expect to generate year over year adjusted positive operating leverage in the second half of reflecting our expense actions our continued success growing our fee based businesses and our proactive balance sheet management we expect total net charge offs in to be in the 45basispoint to 55basispoint range if the proposed stimulus passes we would expect to be at the lower end of that range in summary our fourth quarter and fullyear results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years toward achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle we will continue to rely on the same principles disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and a focus on a long term performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks jamie before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a follow up and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time weve allotted this morning melissa please open the call up for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott siefers from piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co just wanted to ask about sort of the ci outlook near term i guess i would characterize the commentary as constructive but yet the outlook for just i think increase in line utilization in the second half it seemed to me it stands in a bit of contrast from some of your peers who seem to require a more robust acceleration in ci later in the year i guess im just curious for maybe more color on how youre thinking about the potential rebound in ci as the economy normalizes around say midyear or so gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey scott this is greg first of all id say we were encouraged by the fourth quarter pipeline growth that weve seen up significantly over third quarter albeit slightly down from where we were in so were seeing progress out there and its really its pretty broadbased across all of our regions and across our verticals so were encouraged by the strength were seeing there obviously theres a lot of unknowns going in as we go into additional stimulus the vaccines and so forth the recovery so its a hard thing for us to gauge what the expectations are but theres a lot of liquidity out there right now so were optimistic that the vaccines could be distributed appropriately and we get our economy back in full swing second half of the year that those numbers might look stronger but right now were just being at the end of day conservative but encouraged by the pipelines that weve seen already fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 i dont know tim if you have anything more to add timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp no i think thats absolutely right as you said i think were particularly pleased with the pickup in middlemarket production that we saw in the fourth quarter and the continued strength in the industry verticals like renewable energy technology and health care where the bank has made fairly significant strategic investments over the course of the past several years r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then just within your guidance for the full year i know that you guys conservatively dont include the ppp impact just curious however to the extent that they do come through how are you expecting those to ebb and flow will most of the forgiveness from the first round is that expected them to be sort of a first half event or how do you see that flowing through james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah scott its jamie for ppp in total nii we expect about million in which includes about million in accelerated forgiveness fees which compares to about million of total nii in which included only million in accelerated forgiveness fees and right now in our outlook we expect first quarter forgiveness fees to be in line with the fourth quarter perhaps thats well do better than that from a forgiveness perspective weve got about million or a little bit less than of the originations forgiven and so as we model it out we expect the majority of the fees from the originations to be forgiven in the third quarter as borrowers approach that 16month time horizon of needing to make payments or have it forgiven so right now we expect the back half of the year to have a little bit more accelerated fees and then as we mentioned in the prepared remarks we expect the round of ppp to be about billion in originations and then that will accrue at a lower rate just given the fiveyear term on those loans so we expect about a yield prior to any of the forgiveness fees r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you all very much operator your next question comes from the line of ken usdin from jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning guys jamie on the fee side its good to hear you reiterate that up to core growth excluding tra i heard your comments about mortgage for the first quarter but can you just give some more color in terms of what you expect to drive that growth this year and how mortgage fit into that equation james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 sure i think some of the momentum coming off of will lead to a very successful in the fee businesses we did grow households on the consumer side and then the investments we made and the capital markets offerings over the past several years that should bear fruit in so when you line up the fee categories for i expect high singledigit growth in treasury management and commercial banking which does include the capital markets business midsingledigits growth in consumer deposit fees wealth and asset management and card and processing and then low singledigit growth in mortgage ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it so even with the strong year given some of that i guess it was a capacity point you made earlier about mortgage you still think mortgage can grow this year is that just because you see production pulling through or do you see less of the msr drag over time just maybe little more color on the mortgage side thanks james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah on mortgage in the fourth quarter there were capacity constraints and there was the headwind from our decision to portfolio million of our retail production those loans will close in the first quarter and then you will see that show up in the residential mortgage balances in held for investment and from there we do expect the capacity constraints to be behind us and from an msr perspective this environment for servicing is certainly challenging we expect that to abate in the second half of and allin the low singledigit growth for i think is a very achievable number for us ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay understood thanks a lot jamie operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter from wedbush securities your line is open peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i wanted to ask about capital and if you could just go over the capacity whats left in the existing share buyback how much you have left and then secondarily if the fed were to lift the restrictions on share buybacks just how youre thinking about capital returns james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah thanks for the question peter in we approved a million share repurchase program we have million shares left under that program so call it billion right now for if you assume the fed fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 continues their trailing 12month net income test and you look at our guide on earnings you should generate about billion of capacity assuming no additional reserve releases and if you look at our capital from a spot basis at the end of we have about billion of excess even with the loan performance that weve had so i think for should the fed open the window billion or so as i think everything triangulates to that level peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc okay thats helpful and then you guys lowered the net chargeoff guidance from december december i think it was basis points to basis points what gives you the confidence that like theres nothing looming especially with some of these loans coming off deferral assuming we dont get an additional stimulus package richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah hey its richard thanks for the question i think it really comes down to the activity we have from a risk management perspective the confidence we have in the underwriting and our portfolio management we continue to see consumer loss rates lower than normal we saw them lower than normal in we expect that to continue in as the impact of stimulus rolls through the portfolio remember our portfolio is concentrated in prime and super prime we have a weighted average fico of close to so confidence in whats happening there from an activity standpoint we do expect commercial losses to tick up a little bit from the into the high low and thats just going to be a function of the normal migration we see in commercial we highlighted some potential atrisk industries in the deck but weve seen criticized assets come down as jamie mentioned weve seen positive resolutions in our workout group and so just given what we see in the portfolio where we see performance restabilization across a number of sectors we have a lot more confidence in that range peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy from stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning maybe start with a question for jamie who i guess by now well call the chief cook and bottle washer at fifth third so a question for jamie pretty clear on kind of the securities purchases and your thoughts there on holding cash i guess my question are there opportunities to purchase loans like the government guaranteed loans that you had in the fourth quarter as well as the decision to just hold more mortgages on the balance sheet as you think about the next months james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah and thats essentially what we did in the back half of in the third quarter we repurchased our own ginnie mae forbearance pool now its about million that came on to our balance sheet in the fourth fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 quarter we purchased the servicers pool to the tune of billion as well as taking the million of retail production and putting it on the sheet i think for now weve done a lot of work on the residential mortgage portfolio to improve it and we think the returns are incredibly attractive i think going forward id like to see the loan growth be in other categories just given the convexity risk you have in residential mortgage and that weve done enough so thats why we expect in the first quarter to get back to selling all of our production but again i think the trade that we were able to execute was a nice deployment of excess cash and certainly a far better return than just buying mortgagebacked securities we think the roa is or so on that transaction versus security purchases are probably to sub1 right now terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and then just as a followup just looking at the cecl allowance im curious what was behind the increase in commercial mortgage and commercial construction other categories drifted lower those two were up higher quarteroverquarter and i was hoping to get some insight there thank you richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah its richard again look in commercial real estate weve seen continued negative migration thats just a portfolio and an asset class that has a longer tail in terms of when problems arise and a longer tail when theyre going to be resolved so we saw criticized assets go up in that sector and so that plus some qualitative adjustments because we dont believe that the models fully reflect the variables that are impacting some of these subsectors like hospitality and retail in terms of the time of recovery and so just given the asset migration trends and some qualitative adjustments that drove the acl for commercial real estate higher in the quarter terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks again operator your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe from morgan stanley your line is open kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks first question just in terms of the nii guidance i just want to make sure that the or question whether the down in does that include your expectation of accelerated ppp fee income james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah thanks for the question so we do include the billion of additional ppp in our guide i think the nii guide of down that trajectory could improve i guess to the point of the first question on the call today through higher commercial line utilization because we do assume just a small uptick in the back half of the year and frankly there is not much we can do about that its a borrowercustomer demand situation fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 a steepening yield curve benefit would also help we anchor our guidance on the january implied forward curve so perhaps well do a little bit better there and should the curve steepen significantly then we would have opportunity to deploy excess cash third with regard to the ppp were assuming billion of originations and perhaps thats a conservative number because as we sit here today weve submitted over billion in apps in just the first two days and then finally as greg mentioned perhaps therell be better commercial loan production through higher borrower demand and capex and inventory buildups and from a production expectation perspective were expecting commercial loan production to be up about or so from but still down or so from levels so our outlook assumes improvement but not returning to the type of economy kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay all right and then just my second question i think greg mentioned the ce tier you want to target currently which i totally understand but you did make a comment that you would kind of reconsider that as the economy gets better can you just help us dimension like lets assume that the economy is fully better like where is a good level for fifth third to run on ce tier james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp so prior to some of the challenges that were cropping up in the environment we had a target so should the economy improve as we hope it does in the back half of i think is a logical next step for us when we stresstest our balance sheet we believe our balance sheet has a risk profile that could be run in the to range our stress capital buffer is currently so i guess the feds perspective is much lower than that but i think for us for this year were targeting and well evaluate that target as we see how the economy unfolds kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bill carcache from wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning we saw back book repricing headwinds to loan yields persist throughout the last zirp cycle and not just for fifth third but across the banking system i believe about half of your loan portfolio is variable rate and indexed to the short end of the curve but theres still some repricing yet to come through would you expect a similar dynamic with further pressure on loan yields to come in this zirp cycle as well maybe if you can just speak to that and maybe compare and contrast whats different about this cycle james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp well i think thats a good observation and we are experiencing that phenomenon and we saw it in the fourth quarter nim and its a factor in our first quarter guide right now from ci production levels just given the floating fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 nature of the portfolio yields are roughly in line maybe bps below the current portfolio but on the consumer side which is more a fixed rate in nature instruments we are seeing new production yields to basis points below portfolio yields and so that is certainly a headwind in our nii outlook bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and separately sorry if i missed this but i wanted to ask about if you could give some color on new money rates in light of the curve steepening that weve seen on the security side it seems like some of the dynamics around qe have led agency mbs spreads over treasuries to turn negative which would seem to temper some of the benefits of the steeper curve but i was hoping that you guys could discuss some of the opportunities that you see there james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah its a great question and were seeing a divergence in practice across the banks our view in terms of what the rate environment would need to progress to in order to put our excess liquidity to work is we would like to see basis points or more improvement in the entry points either through the spread widening or curve steepening a lot of banks to your point buying in on the basis points of steepening or even before that but credit spreads have tightened basis points or more over that time so that the net entry point improvement to us is not that compelling in fact by our math if you bought in the third quarter even in the first couple months of the fourth quarter you lost in value for every in carry you picked up over that period of time so you still have more risk should the curve steepen further and we dont want to be stuck in a bad trade chasing balances at what are still historically low levels of rates so the good news for us is we are very wellpositioned in the investment portfolio we have the luxury of time portfolio of cash flows are about billion a quarter is how were modeling it so we just think being patient we can afford to be patient and well move when we think were getting the appropriate risk return in the environment bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats very helpful thank you for taking the questions operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian from bank of america your line is open erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning my first question is a clarification question jamie you mentioned billion in buyback capacity for the year but that would imply that the fed expands its income test beyond the first quarter correct james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yes million in the first quarter and then any additional repurchases are certainly subject to the fed allowing us to do so fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc so if they lift the income restriction i guess number one what are your plans for dfast participation this summer and number two where could that capacity grow to if you were not subject to that income restriction after first quarter james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp so the ill take the second part of the question first because thats the easier one right now against our target of we have a billion of excess capital so until the economy shows significant improvement billion would take us down to our target so i think thats a fair number to use the income test would deliver a little bit less that in terms of the ccar optin its funny because weve discussed this as a team and we officially have until april to decide but right now given that our binding capital constraint is our own internal target of versus the feds prior stress capital buffer for us at or even in their covid test should they adopt those december results in the scb frankly we feel like our team deserves a rest at following the six stress tests we did during the pandemic and theres essentially nothing to be gained by participating so i think for now if i had to decide today i would decide not to opt in erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just my second question is on the net chargeoff outlook for this cycle should we think that basis points to basis points as your quantification of the peak or are you expecting the spike to be delayed in im just trying to square that with a reserve exppp james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah yeah so its interesting when you look at the guide for us the basis points to basis points for the first quarter we actually expect chargeoffs to be in the 40basispoint to 45basispoint range and grow during the year and to your point losses get pushed out but we certainly expect the basis points to basis points range to be the peak even though some of the additional stimulus are elongating the cycle i think ultimately the peak of the cycle keeps coming down which is why we continue to guide to a better and better numbers so right now i think basis points to basis points will be the peak for us erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore isi your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning on the back to the capital topic given your thoughts on capital and where you stand in terms of excess can you just give us your updated thoughts on ma potential in terms of both bank opportunities and what your thoughts are there as well as on the nonbank side thanks fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp john this is greg good question we get it often as you might imagine first off we havent changed our position were really focused on nonbank ma opportunities as evidenced by our recent acquisition of h2c that really supports our notforprofit health care part of our vertical so its really about making sure that we are additive to both our products and our service capabilities for our feebased business whether it be wealth and asset management our payments capability our capital markets capability thats where were spending our energies right now and in really getting out of businesses that are more hobby such as we talked about our property and casualty business that wasnt really providing returns were looking for and we couldnt get the scale so our focus is going to continue to be on those opportunities to enhance our business value proposition and grow those fee businesses thats what weve been focused on the last five years mainly from a bank ma perspective its not on our agenda right now as always we would assess an attractive situation but today thats not our focus our focus is on nonbank ma that adds to the businesses we just discussed john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks greg and then on that front on the nonbank front i know you mentioned wealth and asset management just to confirm is that is it both areas that youd be interested in i know youve expressed an interest in wealth but you would also be interested in the institutional asset management side as well gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp no not the institutional side were pretty much focused on like i said the wealth and asset management side where we made acquisitions like franklin street partners in north carolina thats pretty much our focus right now on the wealth side of business john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thats helpful and if i can ask just one more question in terms of the securities portfolio just wanted to get an update on how the underlying credit within the securities book is holding up i know you have a cre concentration there in terms of cmbs but just wanted to get an updated an update there on what youre seeing in terms of the performance of the underlying securities if theres any stress there evolving thank you james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah were invested in about billion of nonagency cmbs and its holding up well the delinquency rates are mid to high singledigits but the credit enhancement right now is approaching and we only invest in the super senior aaarated tranches so that were at the top of the repayment stack so were not concerned about the credit exposure in the nonagency book john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay great thank you fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i think i heard you correctly so youre kind of guiding for negative operating leverage in the first half of the year and positive operating leverage in the second half of the year and kind of flattish for the year as a whole is that kind of a fair summary of what you guys said james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so the question really is on the spending and im sure theres a lot of opportunities to spend money but from the strategic landscape you have a lot of large banks that are opening up branches in some of your markets others that are saying branch lite digital first some are trying to use their credit cards in the markets to crosssell others are moving kind of middle market businesses into your area so as it relates to the kind of the competitive banking wars in your markets how do you think about that i mean are you seeing any impact yet are you worried about that over the next five years is it much to do about nothing or is this a major strategic threat and you say hey we need to spend more money on x y and z gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp and mike let me start this is greg and im going to throw it to tim this is a great question for him also you think about the investments we are making we still expect to run on an expense basis down next year as we continue to make the strategic investments our strategies and youve heard this over and over have not changed in the last five years as far as how were focused on the businesses which is digital transformation feeding our business organic opportunities to grow our businesses such as our feebased businesses i just discussed a moment ago and you add that to the acquisitions our fintech plays to add to our products and capabilities to deliver through our customers our services so were going to continue to focus on that were very competitive the household growth that weve seen at strong growth in our southeast markets were a leader in the chicago market so we like those investments so were very comfortable in our ability to compete we think our investment structure we have in place today allows us to continue to grow our franchise and be extremely competitive so were not going to change that were going to continue to feed the opportunities that we think create the greatest value for our shareholders fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 let me let tim add a few comments from his timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah no i mean mike new competition is always something that we watch closely and i think i would not isolate it just to the folks who are traditional financial institutions that are building into our markets we pay a lot of attention to the fintech companies particularly given that in some cases they are arbitraging the regulatory apparatus at the moment in a way that creates imbalanced competition i think the point that greg made that to me is the most important one is we have on a sustained basis continued to gain share even in our highestdensity markets over the course of the past three or four years on primary banking relationships which we view as being the best measure of market share because the decisions you make on pricing a deposit product or you domicile headquarter deposits or otherwise have a big impact on the fdic numbers that you sometimes see people use on a periodtoperiod basis so the strong household growth we have seen across the franchise in particular and focused markets like chicago and the southeast as greg mentioned on the consumer side of the business and the strong core relationship growth that we continue to see out of our middle market franchise are the things that give us confidence in our ability to continue to compete mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and i think you say household growth over what timeframe and thats an interesting way to think about it because what youre making for household is depressed from a below rate environment so the household growth over the past year or what timeframe timothy n spence a president fifth third bancorp yeah its household growth over the past year but if you were to look at our growth in prior years it wouldve been in the to range quite steadily so weve actually seen some acceleration driven both by the buildout in the southeast and the growth rates for our chicago market postmb that among the strongest in the franchise and definitely far stronger than we had seen in chicago when we were fifth third on a standalone basis mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of saul martinez from ubs your line is open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to followup on erikas comments and question it seems to me like your reserve ratios are just completely inconsistent with your chargeoff guidance your nco of basis points at the midpoint your and at the peak of the cycle does seem to be suggesting that the government has effectively played the role of superhero and prevented credit cycle from really even emerging and your reserves are about times that and i would guess your weighted average remaining life is not five years and that doesnt even consider that your nco rates are going to fall from here so can you just help me bridge the gap on your reserve levels relative to your chargeoffs because the conclusion would be it would fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 seem to me to be that youre making an ample level of qualitative adjustments or your probability weighting downside scenarios pretty conservatively and that we should be thinking that its pretty likely you are going to see pretty significant reserve releases in the coming quarters james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah its a very good question and the answer really comes down to the fact that the modeling of the acl is based on the moodys hypothetical scenario and thats frankly why we included that in the prepared remarks so everybody would have that information it is certainly a scenario that is one the base scenario is more conservative than our own outlook and two does include a allocation to a downside scenario but obviously we dont expect to happen so by its very nature delivers an acl reserve that would be higher than our expectation for losses in this environment saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc so is your model factoring in that chargeoffs that are higher than what youre guiding to in james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp well the reserve calculation is for us a threeyear reasonable and supportable period and then it reverts back over the remaining years to your historical loss rates whereas our guide is our internal modeling over the next months so you can have differences in that given the different scenarios that are used saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right yeah i dont want to belabor this but like if youre saying that this is the peak and your reserves are times that it just seems hard to disconnect the two to that degree its just seems like there is a james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp i think yeah i think saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc its a hard thing to square away there james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah i think to your question if the outlook continues to improve all other things being equal the reserve will come down and should come down saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah right right fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp our point is we remain conservatively positioned and prudently positioned given the uncertainty in the environment and wed like to get through another three to six months and see how this saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp unfolds with vaccine efficacy and the economy turnaround gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp i think thats really important what saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah i mean once yeah right gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thats really important what jamie has said saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc its a good problem to have so go ahead sorry gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yeah no this is a conversation thats this is greg this is a conversation which obviously thats on the forefront of how we think about our business but we are taking a conservative approach we do want to wait and see over the next couple quarters how those vaccines play out how the economy plays out i mean youre exactly right if you look at what weve got modeled versus what our expectations are we think theres significant upside for reserve releases as we go into the latter part of this year if things play out as we expect they would saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay just as a quick follow additional question on expenses just to make sure im getting the glide path right here based on your full year and your first quarter expenses it would seem like at the midpoint of the range youre factoring at about billion a quarter of expenses from to and i guess you get there in with most of the way there with the seasonal expenses going away but i mean is it fair to say like how do we think about that glide path and should we be thinking that by fourth quarter with some of these expense initiatives filtered through you could be even below that billion run rate as you head into fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp yeah its a good observation we do have a higher run rate in the first quarter due to the seasonal items that we typically have and that i discussed saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp in the prepared remarks and yes when you model it out billion is a fairly good run rate to assume given the revenue projections if fee growth ends up being better than the to and expenses obviously revenue lines saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp will be higher but for our outlook you are exactly right and then the benefit that we might have in the fourth quarter is to the extent our lean process automation and other initiatives pay off sooner than the time horizon then you could see some additional improvement in the fourth quarter but for now were expecting saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp million to million of savings to occur in and not in saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning greg good morning jamie fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp morning james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc coming back to loan loss reserves when you take a look at your loan loss reserve on january when the cecl was put into place for you and your peers i think your loan loss reserve was about basis points james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp basis points yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc there you go clearly its higher today do you think ultimately i dont know if its or but is that a good endpoint that we should look at in terms of when this whole covid issue is behind us and as the second part of this whole loan loss reserving whats your guys view on cecl now that weve had it for a year i know it was a very tumultuous year but do you think its made it more volatile less volatile james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp ill take the first question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc you dont have to answer the two james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp ill let greg answer the second gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp in terms of the basis points and the day one level weve spent a lot of time looking at that as to when should we or if we ever should return back to that day one basis points and right now our current thinking is that in fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 order to get there its going to measured a lot longer than several quarters because were going to exit this crisis with corporate debt levels leverage levels significantly higher coming out than they were going in and the way the modeling works you would have to have an economic outlook as good as the outlook was essentially in of and that might be hard to ever get back to at least in the next couple of years so i think the bias for all of our reserves across the industry is probably to take a longer period of time and ultimately you said take a guess as to where that plays out over the next two years or at the end of two years from now would you be at your day one i would say we probably are over that number because of the corporate debt levels and because the economic outlook is probably not as favorable as the outlook was when we adopted cecl gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp in terms of gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp yes volatility absolutely yes james c leonard a executive vice president chief financial officer fifth third bancorp okay gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp i mean obviously given the cecl methodology and going into a stress environment you saw those huge huge swings that were dealing with right now then also it just was necessary to release the reserves the models havent been tuned for this no one modeled in a pandemic these are new models so theres a lot of qualitative adjustments to these models that bears burdens to the uncertainty in front of us right now so it does definitely make it more volatile for us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no doubt greg here is a bigger picture question for you when you go down the elevator in the evening the outlook for the banking industry including fifth third is positioned very well assuming this economy recovers as we all think it will those bank stock prices as you know from your own stock price since the pfizer announcement right after the election has been fantastic what do you see as everything is hopefully going to shape up really well this year but what are the risks that you worry about when you go down that elevator at night gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 first off good question i think were wellpositioned to be competitive in the markets that were in the investments that weve made i think are in line with our longterm growth expectations and success of our business so i feel really good about how were competing today the challenge always is is when were watching these fintech players come forth not seeing the same regulatory oversight that were dealing with capital expectation and so forth so theres a threat there that were kind of watching if they get access to the banking system payment rails and so forth that can create some stress for us that im very concerned about but as far as our investments in fintech entities themselves and investments that were making im comfortable with its really those fintech players out there that are under the same regulatory framework that we are creating some stress for us nipping around the edge of our profit pools and maybe shifting some customer behavior so thats probably the thing that keeps me up most at the night as far as competing against other banks i think weve done all the right things to do that just making sure we keep our eyes open and we have been on what it looks like were competing with some of these other nontraditional bank players to that end thats why weve made significant investments in our digital capabilities and really create a digital bank ourselves all of our lending products are online available depository products online service capabilities and weve made huge investments in our digital capabilities to make sure were wellpositioned to deal with those type of threats gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you greg gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks operator your last question comes from the line of christopher marinac from j montgomery scott your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks greg just leveraging off of your last answer to gerard do you see fintech acquisitions as a necessary item in the future or do you just want to be a good customer of these companies gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp i think once again weve been either a partner or acquirer of fintech opportunities once again it gets back into our strategy whether its buy partner then build so we really want to focus on the technology and the capabilities that are already out there and it fits into our strategic direction with respect to how were going to offer it and with the opportunity it looks like from a growth perspective wed like to buy that capability if its already there its quicker way to get for the market if we cant do that youve watched us do numerous fintech partnerships to allow us to get the capabilities through that type of relationship and if we cant do that youve watch us build and build those capabilities thats really been our mindset over the last decade with respect to how we handle fintechs or how we address those opportunities fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 21jan2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks very much and thanks for all the information this morning gregory d carmichael a chairman chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you take
