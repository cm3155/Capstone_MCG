you for joining us today well be discussing our results for the third quarter of please review the cautionary statements on our materials which can be found in our earnings release and presentation these materials contain reconciliations to nongaap measures along with information pertaining to the use of nongaap measures as well as forwardlooking statements about fifth thirds performance we undertake no obligation to and would not expect to update any such forwardlooking statements after the date of this call im joined this morning by our president and ceo greg carmichael cfo tayfun tuzun chief risk officer jamie leonard and chief credit officer richard stein following prepared remarks by greg and tayfun we will open the call up for questions let me turn the call over to greg now for his comments gregory d carmichael chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thanks chris and thank all of you for joining us this morning i hope you are all doing well and staying healthy once again our financial results were strong despite the challenges associated with the current environment as an essential business we continue to take appropriate actions for our customers our employees and our communities during the pandemic earlier today we reported third quarter net income available to common shareholders of million or per share our reported eps included a negative impact from the items shown on page of our release excluding these items adjusted third quarter earnings were per share tayfun will provide more details on the quarterly financial results in his remarks but i will share some highlights all reported and adjusted return metrics were solid reflecting our strong operating results including the provision for credit loss performance our credit losses were significantly better than expectations at basis points our third quarter chargeoffs were the lowest level in over a year with improvement in both consumer and commercial portfolios consumer net chargeoffs of basis points is the lowest in the past 15plus years reflecting our consistently strong approach to underwriting as well as the benefits of fiscal stimulus and payment deferrals our already strong capital position further improved this quarter our cet1 ratio of is well above our stated target of around and our income levels combined with the outcomes from our quarterly stress test continue to suggest that we will maintain our current dividend furthermore we have grown tangible book value per share for six consecutive quarters fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 our ppnr results were better than our previous expectations reflecting the strength and resilience of our diverse revenue mix in retail commercial and wealth and asset management based on our feebased businesses many of our feebased businesses are generating strong results that are helping to cushion the impact of lower rates for instance wealth and asset management revenue increased sequentially as we generated positive aum inflows again this quarter as we have done in out of the last quarters capital markets revenue was up from last year and was down slightly relative to the record second quarter on a yeartodate basis total commercial banking fee revenue was up compared to last year top line mortgage revenue is up from the yearago quarter with the low rate environment impacting servicing revenue and the msr valuation deposit fees increased and processing revenue increased sequentially both better than our previous guidance as we are seeing early signs of normalization in business and consumer spending patterns while we continue to streamline our operations and position the bank for long term success we continue to assess strategic investments and nonbank acquisitions in our feebased businesses to accelerate revenue growth for instance we recently increased our strategic investment in bellwether enterprise a national multiproduct cre firm which we originally announced in april this investment provides clients with a broader set of permanent financing solutions without fifth third being exposed to the balance sheet risk associated with longer duration cre assets commercial loan production was relatively stable this quarter compared to the second quarter offset by further declines in line utilization total average loans declined sequentially within our previous guidance range we expect nearterm pressure in the loan portfolio to continue despite the tepid loan environment net interest income exceeded our previous guidance as we aggressively reduced our deposit costs in excess of our prior expectations while the environment remains uncertain our commercial loan pipelines are beginning to improve in certain areas particularly in technology telecom healthcare and industrials which should provide support as we head into next year before i turn it over to tayfun to further discuss our results and outlook ill review our guiding principles strategic actions and key strategic priorities which will enable us to continue to generate longterm shareholder value we have consistently communicated our throughthecycle principles of disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and an overall balance sheet management approach focused on longterm performance our unwavering adherence to these principles and our balance sheet strength gives us confidence as we navigate this environment we have executed numerous strategic actions over the past five years in anticipation of a downturn which will continue to serve us well weve reduced our credit risk exposures and built strong reserve coverage weve built longterm protection to mitigate the impact of lower interest rates we took decisive actions to reduce our expense base and we successfully invested in and diversified our fee businesses from a commercial client standpoint we continue to focus on generating relationships with clients who have more diversified and resilient businesses we are confident in our client selection process and proactive approach to credit risk management we continue to believe we are well positioned relative to peers in commercial real estate an area where we have remained disciplined we have focused predominantly on toptier developers with a track record of resiliency our portfolio is well diversified by geography and property type and as we have discussed before we continue to be at the low end of peers as a percentage of total capital fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 in addition to the cre portfolio our other lending portfolios continue to do well be well positioned combining our strong retail and regional commercial banking franchises in the midwest and southeast with our national lending businesses these portfolios will be instrumental in delivering a differentiated credit performance given the likelihood of an uneven economic recovery were monitoring our exposures across our total commercial loan portfolio utilizing early warning systems through a combination of internal portfolio analysis and thirdparty data our relationship teams receive timely alerts if we detect any sign of credit deterioration this helps us make prompt prudent and accurate credit rating determinations proactively without waiting for customer statements looking ahead to we continue to expect fullyear net chargeoffs to come in well below we have also strengthened our balance sheet by building longterm protection through the positioning of our securities and hedge portfolios with the high likelihood of lower rates for the next several years our prudent interest rate risk management should help preserve our core margin our very strong balance sheet liquidity has enabled us to decisively act and aggressively lower deposit rates given the industrywide revenue headwinds including the strong likelihood of persistently low interest rates we recently announced an expense optimization plan we are taking decisive and appropriate actions to reduce our expense base both temporarily reflecting the weaker revenue environment and also permanently based on long term structural saving opportunities our four key strategic priorities remain intact leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation driving organic growth and profitability expanding market share in key geographies and maintaining a disciplined approach on expenses and client selection we will put the appropriate level of prioritization and focus on the areas that have the highest probability of driving strong financial returns and generate longterm value for our shareholders in order for us to emerge from the current environment a top performing regional bank our balance sheet strength diversified revenues and continued focus on disciplined expense management will serve us well as we navigate this challenging environment i would like to once again thank our employees im very proud of the way you have responded in extraordinary ways to support our customers our communities and each other during these unprecedented times our commitment to generating sustainable value for our stakeholders is evident in our inaugural environmental social and governance report as we also became the first us commercial bank to join the sasb alliance and the gri community our report and other helpful disclosures are available for your review on a dedicated esg page on our investor relations website with that ill turn it over to tayfun to discuss our third quarter results and our current outlook tayfun tuzun chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you greg good morning and thank you for joining us today lets move to the financial highlights on slide three of the earnings presentation reported results for this quarter were negatively impacted by three notable items a million aftertax charge related to our previously announced restructuring plan a million aftertax negative mark related to the visa total return swap and million aftertax from covidrelated expenses fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 strong operating results for the quarter reflected solid business performance throughout the bank as well as the impact of provision which resulted from our best quarterly chargeoff performance since mid2019 stabilization in key forwardlooking macroeconomic indicators compared to the past couple of quarters as well as lower period end balances although we are seeing relative stability in the key macroeconomic variables used in our reserve calculations we continue to take a cautious approach given remaining uncertainties related to the pandemic and the economy our base case macroeconomic scenario assumes gdp remains below the end of levels until the second quarter of with an unemployment rate worse than the current environment remaining elevated above through our base case is generally more conservative than the fed base scenario published last month our downside scenario assumes that gdp will remain below the end of levels until the second quarter of with unemployment further deteriorating from the third quarter exceeding through the first half of until improving to by the end of and reaching by the end of if we were to assign a probability to the downside scenario we would likely require an additional billion in reserves based on our current balance sheet exposures reported and adjusted revenues grew sequentially despite the generally weak environment as we outperformed our previous fee and nii expectations total noninterest income excluding the impact of securities gains was up sequentially percentage points better than our previous guidance with respect to the outsized securities gains this quarter it is important to note that our unrealized gains in the portfolio at the end of the quarter remain very high at billion our very deliberate actions over the past few years that focused on structuring the portfolio in anticipation for a lower rate environment should continue to give us a strong advantage as a very effective hedging tool to help mitigate the rate headwinds having said that we will continue to be prudent in managing the gains for the best outcome for our shareholders cognizant that these gains will continue to be subject to future volatility especially to fluctuations in the current prepayment environment this quarter a small portion of our portfolio gains cushioned the impact of the restructuring charges that we incurred related to our expense reduction plan which we believe was a prudent riskbased action in light of the current environment reported and adjusted noninterest expenses were flat yearoveryear on a sequential basis adjusted expenses increased slightly more than our previous guidance of up we are in the midst of executing our expense reduction actions announced last month which will generate annual efficiencies of million starting in with an additional million to million of annual efficiencies to be generated starting in as a result of our strong revenue performance and continued expense discipline ppnr increased sequentially and outperformed our july guidance by approximately million given the strong ppnr performance combined with the credit related improvements we generated strong reported and adjusted return metrics we achieved an adjusted roa of and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of excluding aoci despite growing our regulatory capital basis points during the quarter excluding the securities gains our adjusted rotce was nearly even on a creditnormalized basis our underlying rotce performance is indicative of the strength of the franchise and our ability to successfully navigate a low rate environment fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 moving to slide total average loans declined sequentially within our previous guidance range ci loan balance trends continued to reflect lower revolver utilization rates which declined by from the midapril peak to at quarter end and declined by since the end of june the decrease in average ci loans was partially offset by an increase in average auto loan balances due to the uneven nature of revolver utilization rates and the impact of ppp loans we are providing periodend loan balance performance revolving line of credit balances decreased in excess of billion which constituted approximately threefourths of the endofperiod balance quarteroverquarter decline line utilization trends so far in the first two weeks of the fourth quarter indicate continued low utilization levels which we expect will likely persist at least through the end of this year ci client pipelines remained generally soft but have somewhat improved relative to last quarter average and periodend cre loans decreased sequentially as we discussed before we believe that the commercial real estate sector is particularly vulnerable to the current economic environment and potential changes in the postpandemic economy which continues to favor our low exposure and focus on highquality borrowers in this sector average total consumer loans increased sequentially continued growth in the auto portfolio was offset by declines in home equity and credit card auto production in the quarter was strong at billion with average fico scores around and lower advance rates higher internal scores better spreads and a higher concentration of new versus used autos compared to recent quarters most of the other consumer loan categories continued to reflect the generally subdued borrower demand our securities portfolio of around billion decreased compared to the prior quarter reflecting the impact of the sales as well as continued pay downs unless the market environment changes we are unlikely to use any of the excess liquidity to grow our investment portfolio in the near term the underlying riskreturn profile of many of the investment options is not attractive in light of the impact of the aggressive monetary actions that the fed is executing average other shortterm investments which includes interestbearing cash increased billion compared to the prior quarter and increased billion compared to the yearago quarter the significant increase in excess cash is the outcome of the ongoing decline in loan balances combined with record deposit growth over the past six months moving on to slide compared to the prior quarter average core deposits increased with growth in all deposit captions except other time deposits average demand deposits represented of total core deposits in the current quarter compared to in the prior quarter average commercial transaction deposits increased and average consumer transaction deposits increased the deposit growth came from improvement in every line of business and was very granular across product types and customer size overall the deposit performance reflects our strong longstanding client relationships and our customers desire to remain liquid in addition to growth in deposit dollars we once again generate consumer household growth during the quarter reflecting strong production as well as limited attrition as shown on slide we have continued to take proactive steps which are predominantly focused on the right side of the balance sheet to mitigate the impact of lower rates which should provide additional support in the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 coming quarters compared to the second quarter we lowered our interestbearing core deposit rates basis points more than our expectations while continuing to generate strong deposit growth as a result our september interestbearing core deposit rate is now just points with total core deposit costs of just basis points both well below the floors from the previous rate cycle we expect fourth quarter interest bearing core deposit costs to benefit from our actions and decline another few basis points our loantocore deposit ratio improved to as our shortterm investments predominantly interestbearing cash were approximately billion at quarter end excluding ppp loans our loantocore deposit ratio was currently there are no strong indications that the liquidity profile of our balance sheet is likely to change soon as loan growth continues to be elusive and investment opportunities relatively unattractive we will remain we will maintain our shortterm cash balances at these levels until further notice turning to slide reported and adjusted nii decreased compared to the prior quarter the decline was primarily attributable to lower ci balances and the impact of lower market rates these impacts were partially offset by the reduction in deposit costs the full quarter impact of ppp loans day count and the favorable impact of previously executed cash flow hedges as you can see on this slide the hedges added an incremental million to our third quarter nii for a total contribution of million during the quarter purchase accounting adjustments benefited our third quarter net interest margin by three basis points this quarter our adjusted nim decreased basis points sequentially driven by the unfavorable impacts from elevated cash balances which created an approximate basis point drag on nim compared to the prior quarter lower market rates and lower ci balances partially offset by benefits from our actions to lower deposit costs and the previously executed cash flow hedges as we have been highlighting all along our interest rate risk hedging strategy has two pillars the structure and composition of our investment portfolio and the size and duration of our derivative portfolio as i stated earlier our swaps and floors contributed million this quarter our portfolio premium amortization was only million and our portfolio yield declined only basis points you can easily see that our investment portfolio does not erode the protection provided by the derivative portfolio like it has for many of our peers as importantly we have protection in both portfolios longer than our peers excluding the impact of excess cash relative to historical averages and the lower yielding ppp loans normalized nim was approximately for the third quarter we expect that we will continue to be able to generate a normalized nim of around for the foreseeable future helped by our interest rate hedges and investment portfolio composition the fourth quarter nii and nim are both expected to remain stable our guidance has no accelerated benefits from ppp loan forgiveness moving on to slide eight we once again had a strong quarter generating fee revenues that offset the pressure on interest income the resilience in our total fees continues to highlight the level of revenue diversification that we have achieved adjusted noninterest income excluding the benefit of securities gains increased sequentially exceeding our previous guidance by approximately million the strong performance reflected another solid quarter in capital markets strong performance in wealth and asset management and rebounds in deposit service charges card and processing revenue and in the leasing business fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 in our commercial business the strong capital markets revenue was down from the record set last quarter but was up approximately from the yearago quarter mortgage banking net revenue decreased million sequentially primarily driven by an unfavorable msr net valuation adjustment and an increase in msr decay resulting from higher prepayment speeds current quarter mortgage originations of billion increased compared to the prior quarter asset management fees increased sequentially benefiting from stronger market conditions improved brokerage fees and the continuation of positive aum flows the strong wealth and asset management performance over the past several quarters reflects our prioritized investments in this business both in talent upgrades as well as acquisitions to improve the roe profile of our company card and processing revenue increased million or reflecting increases in credit and debit transaction volumes resulting from the continued normalization in consumer spending patterns deposit service charges increased million or with improving commercial deposit fees reflecting a partial loan normalization of treasury management service volumes and lower earning credits as well as elevated consumer deposit fees compared to the prior quarter which included hardshiprelated fee waivers we expect processing revenues and deposit fees to be stable to slightly higher in the fourth quarter moving on to slide third quarter reported pretax expenses included restructuring charges of million intangible amortization expense of million and covidrelated expenses of million adjusting for these items and priorperiod items shown in our materials noninterest expense increased sequentially and decreased million compared to the yearago quarter as we discussed first in september during the barclays conference in light of revenue headwinds we are taking action to reduce our annual run rate expenses by approximately million we have started taking appropriate actions in september and expect to finalize all actions by the end of this quarter we will share with you the full set of details in january during our fourth quarter earnings call when we will also give you an outlook for the direction of our expenses in with respect to personnel decisions we expect to generate the full runrate savings beginning in the first quarter of in addition to the staffing optimization we remain on track to deliver the remaining savings through a combination of process reengineering rationalization of certain smaller noncore businesses vendor renegotiations and corporate real estate rationalization which are all progressing as well as the savings associated with the reduction in our branch network while we will continue to open branches in our existing highgrowth southeast markets to generate household and revenue growth we expect to further optimize our network by closing an additional branches in the first quarter of predominantly in the midwest as we have discussed before the recent acceleration in customer digital adoption trends raises the returns on our technology investments made over the past several years this gives us increased conviction that we can continue to optimize our branch network while also expanding our presence in highgrowth markets also our investments and focus on process reengineering in other areas of our operations will allow us to permanently optimize our expenses in our middle office and back office functions we believe that approximately of the savings are environment dependent when the market rebounds and sustains economic recovery we will readjust these resources accordingly fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 in addition to a nearterm savings target we also announced a longerterm expense strategy which will help us achieve an additional million to million in run rate savings starting in through investments in lean process automation slide provides an update on our covid19 highimpact portfolios the amounts on this page represent approximately of our total loans and are down from last quarter excluding ppp loans as you can see the paydowns during the quarter reduced our balances relative to the second quarter in all subcategories except for leisure travel where we have a rather small overall exposure all to larger operators the total balances on this slide include approximately billion from our leveraged loan portfolio which remains below billion and has decreased sequentially the information on this slide lays out the reasons why we believe that our client selection in these portfolios has been very disciplined with a focus on larger companies that have access to capital in stressed environments and where we have the appropriate credit mitigants in place to limit the ultimate loss content in these portfolios on slide we provide an updated view of the consumer and mortgage portfolios the fico scores clearly indicate the high credit quality of the portfolio with over containing fico scores of or higher on a balancerated basis approximately of the consumer portfolio is secured and as you can see by our fico band distributions our portfolio is heavily weighted in the high primesuper prime space as we have previously discussed we have taken proactive steps to enhance our underwriting standards specifically on minimum fico scores and maximum ltv levels in addition to increasing our efforts in collections turning to credit results on slide the net chargeoff ratio of basis points improved basis points sequentially the sequential improvement reflects favorable outcomes in both portfolios with the commercial credit favorability coming from better resolutions as well as extensions and consumer credit continuing to exhibit results that are more commensurate with a stronger employment environment borrowers have been clearly helped by the stimulus and covidrelated relief programs and those who request an additional days of mortgage payment assistance as provided under the cares act will benefit into next year npas remain generally well behaved at basis points the sequential increase was entirely in commercial with growth coming predominantly from our covid highimpact portfolios and some credits in the energy portfolio which we believe will ultimately result in low loss content our acl ratio declined only by basis point sequentially to reflecting the stability in both the current macroeconomic environment as well as the drivers of the forwardlooking scenarios the low level of net charge offs combined with the million decline in the allowance reflecting lower periodend loans resulted in a net million benefit to the provision slide provides more information on the allocation of our allowance and the composition of the changes this quarter in commercial higher reserve coverage was warranted due to ratings migration during the quarter this was partially offset by lower endofperiod balances compared to last quarter in consumer the change in reserve coverage reflects improvement in the expected loss content in the portfolio including the impact of approximately million in remaining discount associated with the mb loan portfolio our acl ratio was additionally excluding the billion in ppp loans with virtually no associated credit reserve the acl ratio would be approximately fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 our reserves reflect the current macroeconomic expectations embedded in the scenarios that we deploy in this exercise if the outlook does not further deteriorate there should not be a need to increase our reserve coverage beyond the current levels turning to slide our capital and liquidity positions remained strong during the quarter our cet1 ratio ended the quarter at over above our stated target of around given the dynamics during the quarter we are providing you a cet1 reconciliation between net income riskweighted assets and the impact of dividends as you can see dividend payouts constitute a very small portion of the change in cet1 we expect to have adequate capital and trailing reported net income to maintain our current dividend for the foreseeable future we will be resubmitting our stress test in early november with the rest of the ccar banks we have been very consistent in stating our view that given our very strong capital ratios balance sheet strength earnings power and relatively modest precovid dividend payout ratio we expect to fare well we believe that our performance in this downturn ultimately will prove the resiliency of our model our tangible book value per share was this quarter up yearoveryear at the end of the quarter our unrealized pretax gain in our securities and hedge portfolios was approximately billion which is not included in our regulatory capital ratios from a liquidity perspective we have over billion in total liquidity sources slide provides a summary of our fourth quarter outlook we expect a decline in total average loan balances of approximately on a quarteroverquarter basis with a to decline in commercial loans and a to increase in consumer balances the decline in commercial balances is as a result of expected paydowns in commercial credit lines net interest income and nim are expected to be stable to last quarter assuming no benefits from accelerated amortization of ppp fees we expect noninterest income to increase to sequentially including the recognition of our tra income of approximately million we expect our expenses to be flat to slightly up total net chargeoffs are expected to be in the to basis point range in summary our third quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years improving our resiliency diversifying our revenues and proactively managing the balance sheet we will continue to rely on the same principles disciplined client selection conservative underwriting and our focus on the longterm performance horizon which gives us confidence as we navigate this environment we fully intend to preserve the optimal level of efficiency of our operations in this weak revenue environment while we maintain the investments that we believe are vital to preserve the earnings power and the operational resiliency of our company with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for questions chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks tayfun before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have allotted this morning marcella please open the call for questions fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from ken zerbe from morgan stanley your line is open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you in terms of your expense initiatives just given that most of that falls to the bottom line is it actually possible that we see expenses down on an absolute basis in gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp ken this is greg first off we provide guidance after our fourth quarter earnings on that call well talk more about that but as we talked about our expense optimization plans million that we expect to get out by the end of the first quarter of the actions necessary to accomplish that objective has already been completed so were highly confident in our ability to take out that million by the end of the first quarter and then we mentioned another million to million that will show up in once again focused mainly on automation and investments weve made in our technology platforms so were very confident but well provide guidance as far as our expense numbers as we get through the fourth quarter tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah i think and ken the other point that i want to make about the program is we stated that the composition is between permanent savings and environmentrelated savings of but that environmentrelated savings number is really how we see so the other lever that we have here is if things actually look worse or will be worse next year compared to our assumptions we still will continue to adjust those numbers so that part of it is going to be variable and it does have more potential depending upon the economic environment obviously our preference would be that the economy would be stronger and we dont have to necessarily go back to that world but we still have the availability to us ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great and just one followup tayfun youd mentioned that you dont expect to invest the excess cash can you just help us understand like why not invest in i dont know something very shortterm securities with low risk that would generate a lot more than or at least a little more than cash returns tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp ken we dont believe that the tradeoff between the small nii incrementality versus the marktomarket exposure is worth taking at this point it really does not from your perspective our ability to invest the money in the short term doesnt really add much to the longterm performance to the company so because we believe that cash is going to ultimately leave the company over time so therefore we are more interested in shielding ourselves from a marktomarket exposure because the market volatility continues to be a concern for us related to all investments fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right great thank you operator ken usdin from jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks guys good morning a followup on the loan side so obviously you guys have i think been more forthright than others about the declines in loans that youre expecting and the quality of the commercial book can you just give us some thoughts just as you look across the footprint of where if at all you see activity starting to change from a pacing perspective and at what point would you see the loan book especially the commercial side ci starting to bottom out gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp this is greg first off on the loan side on the commercial look at our pipelines were seeing some growth and positive forward progress in the area of healthcare telecom and technology would be two other areas that were seeing some good growth and also the industrials would be the areas that were most encouraged by as we look ahead here so we feel pretty good as we mentioned on the consumer side we expect growth of to next quarter and that business continues to perform well so thats where i think we have the biggest opportunities ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then in terms of the deposit side youve got still good growth and you mentioned some opportunities to still reprice what other offsets do you have on the right side of the balance sheet if any to continue to roll down either the fixed term fixed shortterm borrowings longterm debt footprint in addition to deposit pricing tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp we dont really have a lot of longterm debt opportunities other than just running the maturity schedules at this point so weve pretty much executed what was available to us were looking at some small items maybe bad debt we securitized in the past but those are small opportunities so theres not a whole lot remaining there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then last quick one tayfun you mentioned that youre not really interested in building the securities portfolio other banks have started to put some of their liquidity to work in contrast can you just walk through your philosophy on that and how you expect to just manage overall balance sheet size then if youre not net reinvesting tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 again as i mentioned when ken asked a question at this point we dont believe that the tradeoff between incremental nii associated with marginal investments and continuing to expose ourselves to an unattractive mark tomarket environment related to those investments is attractive so at this point we will continue to watch now those decisions are made on a weektoweek monthtomonth basis if we find opportunities we will be in the market but at this point given what we know today we are currently choosing to be on the sidelines ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood sorry i missed that one operator mike mayo from wells fargo your line is open gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hi mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey i guess i have a wow on the positive side and a wow on the negative side so the wow on the positive side would be only basis points of loan losses and the lowest consumer charges off in years so thats quite noteworthy but the wow on the negative side is a negative provision seems like an outlier and do you really want to set a tone at this stage of the cycle of taking a negative provision i mean you might be right but you might be wrong but we dont really know how this is going to play out so i guess my questions are you said if you had your downside scenario at that would be billion of additional reserves how much overlay do you have for that downside scenario now thats number one number two when you mentioned that there were commercial extensions what does that mean is that delaying some of the inevitable and you did say that loan losses would go up from here and then third just the whole tone perspective like it sets the tone that that hey things are okay tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so again mike this is tayfun let me take the first part of that and then ill turn it over to jamie for his comments look i mean i think as you know at the end of the first quarter at the end of the second quarter we came out much more aggressively in terms of building reserves relative to the peers and when you look at our coverage ratio whether you take the whether you take or we are still above the median levels of our peers and internally obviously when you look at the risk profile of our loan book we feel very good about it and two we really did not take the coverage ratio down its only down from to and the balances obviously are lower at the end of the quarter which had an impact in terms of weighting the scenarios we actually increased we lowered the weight of the base scenario and increased the weight of the down scenario this quarter so we are quite cognizant of potential downturns in the economy but look i mean the underlying profile credit profile of our balance sheet and the outstanding balances resulted in a release and we have to abide by certain accounting principles and do the right thing so thats from my side jamie any comments from your side fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah and mike thanks for the question when we looked at the net provision it really is an output and when you break it down into the two inputs with the cecl reserve the release was million in the quarter and as we said its driven primarily by the payoffs and paydowns in the commercial loan book and as tayfun mentioned the economic outlook did improve during the quarter both from unemployment and gdp perspective which does lower our loss expectations in the portfolio but given the uncertainty in the environment especially related to additional government support we increased the weightings on the upside and downside in the scenarios from last quarter to this quarter and those scenarios really have an asymmetrical profile so it ultimately increases the required cecl reserve and essentially offsets the benefit from the improvement in the economic outlook and to your other question then if we were to run a scenario where its there are no upside or downside scenarios and we just set as base then the reserve requirement would be million less than what it is today so to your point the downside scenario does result in a higher cecl reserve than roughly million or so range mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the other part of the question i mean its your job to work with the borrowers try to bridge the gap between the pre and postcovid economies but when you have commercial extensions i think thats where a lot of people are focused on to the extent that you extend you drop covenants you lose some covenants i dont really theres a whole litany of things that you can do to make the life of borrowers easier in some cases probably most cases that will make sense but in some cases that might not make sense so what are you doing when you mentioned commercial extensions earlier richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp hey mike its richard ill take that one it really is as you described working with the borrowers trying to understand their cash flow needs their cash flow availability the collateral thats available that maybe we dont have as part of a security package so its really just reworking the transactions making sure that were being thoughtful about things like maturity dates and extending maturity dates so that or reamortizing transactions with the cash flow so its really part of the workout process to make sure that we can be as accommodative as we can within the risk appetite support our customers and minimize losses over the long term mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is open matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning sorry if i missed it but did you guys say how much of the million of savings is in the third quarter run rate fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp in the fourth quarter run rate you mean or third quarter matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i guess tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp theres nothing in the third quarter matt and a large majority of the savings will come in the first quarter of matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay so none now and most of the million will be in on average than in the second quarter tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp correct thats correct matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then looking ahead to the kind of so most of that has already been identified i think you said in your earlier comments and then looking ahead to the million and million remind us what some of those drivers might be and when do you think you will have those identified gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp the opportunity this is greg really focuses on our investments in technology artificial intelligence you look at our operations weve done a really good job of being very efficient but we still have more opportunities over there to reduce our peoplerelated costs and really automate a lot of the functions and processes and create more resiliency and higherquality outcomes so we are very focused on process reengineering automation weve identified those process opportunities weve got teams working aggressively on them and we fully expect that well achieve those objectives going forward but that will show up more in than it will in given the time it takes to put some of these processes these reengineering exercises in place matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator scott siefers from piper sandler your line is open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey appreciate you taking the questions you guys are one of the few guys that have offered a chargeoff assumption for next year and you said it a few times well below a percent so i guess in that vein curious how you guys are thinking about how this cycle will end up trajecting in other words will we be taking care of most of the losses from this cycle next year or will they bleed into at a higher rate as well and i guess part of that question is because you guys have such a strong reserve that if losses indeed stay well below a percent i guess im curious under cecl at what point it becomes more challenging even to substantiate todays reserves in other words you dont just look adequately reserved but potentially very overreserved and i guess im just curious about how you guys think about those dynamics gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp theres a lot of moving pieces scott as you think about whats occurring right now with the amount of stimulus that was thrown at on the pandemic whether we get the cares act next iteration of that hows that going to be distributed with respect to ppp potential consumer stimulus opportunities so theres a lot of variables involved here but what we have visibility of right now as you think about the consumer side we can see forward looking at our roll rates and we think were in pretty good shape the consumers are in a pretty good shape as we get into the until we get into the second half of next year and its going to depend on some of the variables i mentioned and some of the actions that are being taken so more to come there but thats probably more of a second half of when we start to see those losses creep up if we dont get next iteration of the cares act on the commercial side once again a lot of challenges with respect to how we think about the sector because it really gets back to when do we see a vaccine out there how effective is it how is it being distributed certain parts of the economy are reopening quicker than the other parts of the economy southeast reopening quicker right now were seeing positive outcomes there from a production standpoint so theres just a lot going on right now which you can assure yourself is were going to be very cautious we came out with aggressive reserve levels were going to be very thoughtful and mindful about how the macro environment looks going forward and what the expectations are and whats happening with some of these government stimulus revenues jamie if you want to give a little more color on it james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah thanks for the question as we look out at and we say well below that for us our models would indicate loss rate in the basis points to basis points range and thats as we sit here today with obviously a lot of uncertainty between the path of the virus and the path of the stimulus and when we look at and analyze a lot of data especially in the consumer portfolio as greg said a little bit easier to predict the model but we get through all the data really the simple answer when you boil it all down is that if you are delinquent going into the pandemic youre going to be delinquent coming out fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 and if youre healthy going in youre going to be healthy coming out and thats what were seeing and internally we call it a windchill effect so if its degrees outside and it could be you get a pretty big tailwind and it feels like its degrees outside really from an unemployment perspective the windchill was reported numbers of and now were sitting around but the windchill because of all of the stimulus programs and hardship relief its actually behaving at a level and thats why you see such good loss rates from us and our forecast assumption for next year has some stimulus round two baked into it but if we get more than what weve assumed then those numbers could continue to improve from there r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right thats perfect thank you guys very much for your thoughts operator gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning everyone gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc tayfun can you share with us i know you touched on the capital position in your prepared remarks and your cet1 ratio now is over can you remind us what your ideal ratio would be in terms of the amount of capital you want to carry to run the company and then second obviously the fed has suspended buybacks for all the large banks including your own whats your view that once the gate is lifted assuming it will be how quickly would you go back into repurchasing your stock tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp gerard we are at the of cet1 today i suspect that as we look ahead by the end of the year we will be approaching likely and we entered this year coming out of with a capital ratio target of and that was actually elevated relative to our target just about a year ago before that and we think that even then back in and we were making comments that we can run this company with an 8handle capital ratio but we are very cognizant of where the peers are and where the regulators are so we said okay probably and then as we saw the probability of a recession going up we lifted back to so from to assuming that we look ahead to a normalized economy thats of capital that we either consume by growing loans or we return to shareholders tough to predict the timing of the regulatory change in their current position but i suspect that when we see the results of this ccar run and when we find out what the regulators are going to do if the gate opens i dont know why it would take us a long time to go back to a buyback scenario in this environment fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and the followup your comments about extending out on the securities portfolio or the cash portfolio your preference not to do that is very understandable would that suggest to us that you are all thinking that interest rates are likely to rise and well see a positive yield curve tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so our perspective on the interest rate outlook is that we will be in this environment for two three years i think its hard to disagree where the market is pricing the next rate moves our concern about i mentioned our concern around not exposing ourselves to a marktomarket were also very concerned that in the current environment the spreads do not reflect the actual riskreturn profiles but they are very skewed by the feds aggressive actions and they turn the credit spreads upside down and in this environment with that kind of uncertainty despite the fact that we are expecting this low rate environment to continue for a while were choosing to be on the sidelines we also expect that down the road here whether its going to happen in or once the sort of fed starts either stepping back a little bit slowing down their aggressiveness and once the market builds a certain level of expectation whether its about inflation or about the other end of this rate cycle the yield curve will start to steepen were not necessarily expecting that to happen in the nearterm so a combination of the fact that a portion of this cash will leave the bank and also we believe that waiting out until a better investment environment is the better alternative for us thats why were sitting out gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very helpful thank you operator saul martinez from ubs your line is open saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning what weighted average remaining maturity are you using in calculating your cecl reserves tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp im sorry can you repeat that question again saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah what is the weighted average remaining maturity of your loan book that youre using as the basis for your cecl calculation tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i dont necessarily have a number ready sort of to give you right now but i suspect that number is between three and five years fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay so yeah and i would think a portion of your ci book is much shorter because its based on contract maturity you do have a fair amount of annual revolvers if it is in that i mean is one way to think about it then sort of whats implicit in the loss content if you were to say four years tayfun it would imply that the reserve ratio implies an average annual loss ratio or chargeoff rate of about basis points i mean is that and youll be higher than that during the peak and maybe lower than that when the credit cycle kind of really goes back to normal is that a fair way to think about it because three and five years would have depending on what number you use it does have a pretty material difference in terms of what the underlying assumption is for annual loss content so i guess i mean is that a good way to think about sort of whats implicit in your estimate tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp saul i think directionally your comment is logical if you look at page and look at the different subportfolios within the commercial book you see that the commercial mortgage loans the coverage ratio for that one is whereas for the ci book its it appears again your question and the logic that youre using is reasonable it gets a little bit skewed in this environment because we are within for the commercial book the bigger impact comes from the reasonable supportable period which is driven solely by the economic outlook so the reason why im hesitating to say you are correct is because that relationship does not necessarily readily translate to a reasonable annual loss content so i just want to make that comment on that saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it thats well understood but i guess my point is that the weighted average remaining maturity is arguably the most important input into this calculation and this isnt a comment on fifth third this is a general comment and we received virtually no information on that from any bank so it is a little bit of a disconnect that i think tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp we can actually saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc is important tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp we can provide you that information and we can do that on a subportfolio basis which will give you a little bit more of content saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah yes yeah one additional question i want to ask on expenses i mean million is almost of your current expense base and i think in the past you guys had talked about the vast majority of that flowing to the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 bottom line and then you have the additional expense saves so is it fair to say we should with all said and done expect your run rate expenses to be lower than what they are now and can you just give us a sense as to the timing i know youre not going to give youre going to wait to get guidance but next quarter you see it up a little bit flat to up and then first quarter has some seasonality so were likely pushing closer to billion in expenses than billion by the first quarter potentially maybe i am wrong but is my logic right that we should expect expenses to be lower on a dollar basis at some point in versus where were at now and any color on timing and magnitude of that tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp so we will maintain our discipline and not give you color on today saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc all right tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp but what goes against that million expense save is going to be some natural builtin inflation whether its related to the merit increases or other compensationrelated inflation and two is going to be investments in our company we will continue to make investments in our company and the technology line item for all the right reasons is going up what we feel good about it though is that we have now established a discipline in the company to look at those investments that are technologyrelated with a very disciplined return requirement so whatever the builtin expense growth is is not going to be driven by head count increases saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp its going to be driven by very reasonable investments in our business that have a return profile that we all feel comfortable with and that we believe is prioritized based on our corporate objectives saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay helpful thank you very much operator erika najarian from bank of america your line is open erika najarian q analyst bank of americamerrill lynch hi just one followup question i know were almost over time as we think about that adjusted nim of assuming no impact from ppp and also assuming a static balance sheet how close are we to the trough fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i believe we are close erika as we look ahead we believe that we have now a level of stability that were comfortable with could it be now within basis points yes it could be and obviously the margin itself today is probably less meaningful of a metric than it has ever been because its the influence of the cash balances that were sitting on but i do believe that with an assumption that we will live in this highly liquid environment for a while we are now pretty close to achieving stability here even if we sort of maintain the level of cash and the faster we get out of the cash position the faster were going to start moving towards that number that we believe our natural nim stands at but what gives us confidence there when you think about it we have billion in the investment portfolio our sort of normal level of earning assets is about billion so and we have i believe its going to take us two three years to get down to where our peers are in their investment portfolio yield in this low rate environment we have a huge advantage there and then we have a significantly longer derivative portfolio compared to most of our peers those two give us a pretty reasonable confidence that once we get out of this liquidity environment we will actually show you a pretty decent margin performance here erika najarian q analyst bank of americamerrill lynch got it thank you operator bill carcache from wolfe research your line is open bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc good morning thanks for squeezing me in if we set hedging benefits aside could you discuss the impact of rates at the long end of the curve remaining low how much are you receiving each quarter on loan and securities portfolio paydowns from your back book and whats the yield differential between whats coming off and what youre putting on across products that should also give us a sense for how much we would benefit from curve steepening tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah so on the investment portfolio you have seen our yields went down by basis points and were not investing anything and the cash flows are reasonably small so that the step down in portfolio yields could be relatively small compared to indiscernible thats what i will say about that in terms of the other fixed portfolios in the auto portfolio which is really the portfolio that is growing right now we are probably the current coupons are probably about basis points or so below the portfolio yield so when you think about that that really is the portfolio loan portfolio thats the only one thats exposed to a fixed rate repricing bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks tayfun fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yep operator john pancari from evercore your line is open john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning just a couple on the credit front do you have what youre criticized or classified assets did in the third quarter richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp yeah hey its richard we had a slight uptick in the third quarter well give you the details in the q it was really around the things that you would imagine hospitality and leisure as the cycle continues to extend john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay all right and then the other thing on the credit front but its not on the loan side you i know commercial mortgagebacked securities make up a larger percentage of your securities portfolio than peers and i know you indicated that tayfun you indicated that commercial real estate is particularly vulnerable do you have any concerns around how that credit dynamic within commercial real estate could impact your bond investments tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp we dont i think we have the commercial real estate the nonagent commercial im sorry nonagency commercial real estate book that we have is a smaller portion its about billion or so in the portfolio and its all super senior tranches so the builtin credit content of that portfolio does not give us any concern james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp and john its jamie i guess since i bought a lot of those bonds i can tell you that i keep an eye on them in the delinquency rates like high single digits in the book and the credit enhancement is approaching so we are a long way away from having any credit issues in that portfolio john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right jamie thank you thats helpful if i can ask just one more question i know you mentioned that youre prioritizing investments in your asset and wealth management including acquisitions and we actually have seen some asset manager deals larger ones in the industry recently is that something you would consider as a potential acquisition of an asset manager for your business there gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 yeah this is greg first off as i mentioned in my prepared remarks weve invested heavily in our fee businesses and diversification of our fee businesses thats going extremely well and wealth and asset management is one of those areas that were very focused on with respect to additional opportunities both from an acquisition of an entity of the nature youre speaking of or talent in that business and as youve seen that business has grown really well for us over the years up sequentially so well continue to look for those opportunities and yes that will be included in that potential opportunity tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp eaton vance was slightly larger than our size appetite so we just indiscernible right john pancari q analyst evercore isi yeah got it all right thank you appreciate it operator christopher marinac from janney montgomery your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hi just had a similar question that john pancari asked about classified and criticized so when you have the commercial extensions do those get picked up as special mention or does something else have to happen before those would migrate richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp its richard again if the two are separate we think about when we think about workouts the rating is the rating and then the workout strategy is the workout strategy now i think when we think about things that impact or reduce chargeoffs clearly thats going to be in the criticize category whether its special mention or substandard but we dont have the details around the breakup between those two remember if you think about special mention that is a potential weakness and theres a ton of judgment of what a potential weakness looks like it just effectively means higher probability of default substandard again another step down in terms of default probability but again thats a place where mitigates like collateral starts to come into play christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great so some of the extensions could be there now but others could transition later its just richard stein a executive vice president chief credit officer fifth third bancorp absolutely and as i said before when we start thinking about extensions were also looking at other mitigates like structural enhancements guaranteed collateral theres other ways we can work with a borrower to help them and protect the bank fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you sounds good richard thank you very much for the insight thanks for all the information this morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp thank you operator your last question comes from the line of vivek juneja from jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you for squeezing me in just a couple of questions jamie i think you mentioned if youre healthy going in youll be healthy going out were you referring to consumers corporates and how are you thinking about what the pandemic does change in the economy and the way things work james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp yeah i was referring to the consumer portfolio where we have a litany of information and then you are just trying to make it as simple as possible no matter how you slice and dice the data the bottom line is and there was such a big focus on hardship relief and hardship programs and redefault rates redeferral rates all of those things but no matter how you slice it it really just comes down to something as simple as youre healthy coming in youre going to be healthy coming out from a consumer perspective and thats why that consumer performance really does reflect frankly credit losses and credit projections as if unemployment were in the range so we feel very very good about that i think to your point about how this ultimately plays out in the economy it really is the competing forces of the path of the virus versus the path of further stimulus so if we get an additional round of stimulus we think the loss curves continue to flatten perhaps elongate but again the peak chargeoffs arent going to be all that high relative to the great financial crisis especially for a bank like fifth third where weve put a lot of thought and effort over the last five years to position the company as well as we have so that we think our loss rates are a fourth of what they were in the great financial crisis so we feel good about that vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so that means even with if you think post pandemic even if unemployment runs at a higher run rate you think itll be fine is what youre assuming james c leonard a executive vice president chief risk officer fifth third bancorp we do but again the stimulus and what that looks like will certainly be a big swing factor in those loss projections so for example on the consumer side we also ran different modeling efforts where we took out stimulus fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript  earnings call 22oct2020 altogether and so we modeled that as a basis point change in our outcomes if there were to be no stimulus so just to put guardrails on what these outcomes might look like vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc one more if i may completely different topic what are you seeing in terms of deposits on a period end basis were flattish but more if you think about consumer and corporate deposits tayfun jamie what are you all seeing in terms of the trends there slowing static still growing any color on that tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp vivek we are seeing stable consumer deposits theyre not going down but were not seeing any noticeable increases in consumer deposits our balances are at very healthy levels there but we are not seeing further increases the commercial balances have continued to pick up and i suspect that will in the fourth quarter its an election quarter and theres a lot of hesitancy on the corporate side to do anything different at this point i do believe that come early hopefully we will see some more emerging signs hard to predict yet which side it will go but that will be dependent on the economy so for the foreseeable future we see maybe small upticks in corporate balances and stable consumer balances vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you operator there are no further questions at this time i turn the call back to chris doll for closing remarks chris doll senior vice president directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp all right
