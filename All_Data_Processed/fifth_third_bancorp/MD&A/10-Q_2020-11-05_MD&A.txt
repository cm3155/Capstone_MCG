such as loans leases and securities and interest expense incurred on liabilities such as deposits other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt net interest income is affected by the general level of interest rates the relative level of shortterm and longterm interest rates changes in interest rates and changes in the amount and composition of interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities generally the rates of interest the bancorp earns on its assets and pays on its liabilities are established for a period of time the change in market interest rates over time exposes the bancorp to interest rate risk through potential adverse changes to net interest income and financial position the bancorp manages this risk by continually analyzing and adjusting the composition of its assets and liabilities based on their payment streams and interest rates the timing of their maturities and their sensitivity to changes in market interest rates additionally in the ordinary course of business the bancorp enters into certain derivative transactions as part of its overall strategy to manage its interest rate and prepayment risks the bancorp is also exposed to the risk of loss on its

concerns that covid19 may overwhelm the health care system states across the us declared lockdowns that restricted social gatherings and ordered temporary closures of businesses deemed nonessential despite the partial lifting of these measures in some of the states in the bancorps geographic footprint the recent fluctuations in the number of covid19 cases mean that it remains unknown when there will be a return to normal economic activity during the third quarter of the bancorp observed the impact of the pandemic on its business the decline of asset prices reduction in interest rates widening of credit spreads borrower and counterparty credit deterioration and market volatility had the most immediate negative impacts on current performance although the bancorp is unable to estimate the extent of the impact the continuing pandemic and related global economic crisis will adversely impact its future operating results as the cases of covid19 continued to rise the disruption

significant accounting standards issued but not yet required to be adopted critical accounting policies the bancorps condensed consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us gaap certain accounting policies require management to exercise judgment in determining methodologies economic assumptions and estimates that may materially affect the bancorps financial position results of operations and cash flows the bancorps critical accounting policies include the accounting for the alll reserve for unfunded commitments valuation of servicing rights fair value measurements goodwill and legal contingencies these accounting policies are discussed in detail in the critical accounting policies section of the bancorps annual report on form 10k for the year ended december on

commitments and goodwill for periods prior to january there have been no other material changes to the valuation techniques or models during the nine months ended september alll the bancorp disaggregates its portfolio loans and leases into portfolio segments for purposes of determining the alll the bancorps portfolio segments include commercial residential mortgage and consumer the bancorp further disaggregates its portfolio segments into classes for purposes of monitoring and assessing credit quality based on certain risk characteristics for an analysis of the bancorps alll by portfolio segment and credit quality information by class refer to note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements the bancorp maintains the alll to absorb the amount of credit losses that are expected to be incurred over the remaining contractual terms of the related loans and leases contractual terms are adjusted for expected prepayments but are not adjusted for expected extensions renewals or modifications except in circumstances where the bancorp reasonably expects to execute a tdr with the borrower or where certain extension or renewal options are embedded in the original contract and not unconditionally cancellable by the bancorp accrued interest receivables on loans are presented in other assets in the condensed consolidated balance sheets when accrued interest is deemed to be uncollectible typically when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status interest income is reversed the bancorp follows established policies for placing loans on nonaccrual status so uncollectible accrued interest receivable is reversed in a timely manner as a result the bancorp has elected not to measure an allowance for credit losses for accrued interest receivables for additional information on the bancorps accounting policies related to nonaccrual loans and leases refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the bancorps annual report on form 10k for the year ended december credit losses are charged and recoveries are credited to the alll the alll is maintained at a level the bancorp considers to be adequate and is based on ongoing quarterly assessments and evaluations of the collectability of loans and leases including historical credit loss experience current and forecasted market and economic conditions and consideration of various qualitative factors that in managements judgment deserve consideration in estimating expected credit losses provisions for credit losses are recorded for the amounts necessary to adjust the alll to the bancorps current estimate of expected credit losses on portfolio loans and leases the bancorps strategy for credit risk management includes a combination of conservative exposure limits significantly below legal lending limits and conservative underwriting documentation and collections standards the strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic industry and customer level regular credit examinations and quarterly management reviews of large credit exposures and loans experiencing deterioration of credit quality the bancorps methodology for determining the alll requires significant management judgment and includes an estimate of expected credit losses on a collective basis for groups of loans and leases with similar risk characteristics and specific allowances for loans and leases which are individually evaluated larger commercial loans and leases included within aggregate borrower relationship balances exceeding million that exhibit observed credit weaknesses as well as loans that have been modified in a tdr are individually evaluated for an alll the bancorp considers the current value of collateral credit quality of any guarantees the guarantors liquidity and willingness to cooperate the loan or lease structure and other factors when determining the amount of the alll other factors may include the borrowers susceptibility to risks presented by the forecasted macroeconomic environment the industry and geographic region of the borrower size and financial condition of the borrower cash flow and leverage of the borrower and the bancorps evaluation of the borrowers management significant management judgment is required when evaluating which of these factors are most relevant in individual circumstances and when estimating the amount of expected credit losses based on those factors when loans and leases are individually evaluated allowances are determined based on managements estimate of the borrowers ability to repay the loan or lease given the availability of collateral and other sources of cash flow as well as an managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued evaluation of legal options available to the bancorp allowances for individually evaluated loans and leases that are collateraldependent are typically measured based on the fair value of the underlying collateral less expected costs to sell individually evaluated loans and leases that are not collateraldependent are measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loans effective interest rate the bancorp evaluates the collectability of both principal and interest when assessing the need for a loss accrual specific allowances on individually evaluated commercial loans and leases including tdrs are reviewed quarterly and adjusted as necessary based on changing borrower andor collateral conditions and actual collection and chargeoff experience expected credit losses are estimated on a collective basis for loans and leases that are not individually evaluated these include commercial loans and leases that do not meet the criteria for individual evaluation as well as homogeneous loans in the residential mortgage and consumer portfolio segments for collectively evaluated loans and leases the bancorp uses models to forecast expected credit losses based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers prepayments and for loans with available credit expected utilization rates the bancorps expected credit loss models were developed based on historical credit loss experience and observations of migration patterns for various credit risk characteristics such as internal credit risk grades external credit ratings or scores delinquency status loantovalue trends etc over time with those observations evaluated in the context of concurrent macroeconomic conditions the bancorp developed its models from historical observations capturing a full economic cycle when possible the bancorps expected credit loss models consider historical credit loss experience current market and economic conditions and forecasted changes in market and economic conditions if such forecasts are considered reasonable and supportable generally the bancorp considers its forecasts to be reasonable and supportable for a period of up to three years from the estimation date for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period expected credit losses are estimated by reverting to historical loss information without adjustment for changes in economic conditions this reversion is phased in ratably over a twoyear period the bancorp evaluates the length of its reasonable and supportable forecast period its reversion period and reversion methodology at least annually or more often if warranted by economic conditions or other circumstances the bancorp also considers qualitative factors in determining the alll these considerations inherently require significant management judgment to determine the appropriate factors to be considered and the extent of their impact on the alll estimate qualitative factors are used to capture characteristics in the portfolio that impact expected credit losses but that are not fully captured within the bancorps expected credit loss models these include adjustments for changes in policies or procedures in underwriting monitoring or collections lending and risk management personnel and results of internal audit and quality control reviews these may also include adjustments when deemed necessary for specific idiosyncratic risks such as geopolitical events natural disasters and their effects on regional borrowers and changes in product structures qualitative factors may also be used to address the impacts of unforeseen events on key inputs and assumptions within the bancorps expected credit loss models such as the reasonable and supportable forecast period changes to historical loss information or changes to the reversion period or methodology when evaluating the adequacy of allowances consideration is also given to regional geographic concentrations and the closely associated effect that changing economic conditions may have on the bancorps customers overall the collective evaluation process requires significant management judgment when determining the estimation methodology and inputs into the models as well as in evaluating the reasonableness of the modeled results and the appropriateness of qualitative adjustments the bancorps forecasts of market and economic conditions and the internal risk grades assigned to loans and leases in the commercial portfolio segment are examples of inputs to the expected credit loss models that require significant management judgment these inputs have the potential to drive significant variability in the resulting alll refer to the allowance for credit losses subsection of the risk management section of mda for a discussion on the bancorps alll sensitivity analysis reserve for unfunded commitments the reserve for unfunded commitments is maintained at a level believed by management to be sufficient to absorb estimated expected credit losses related to unfunded credit facilities and is included in other liabilities in the condensed consolidated balance sheets the determination of the adequacy of the reserve is based upon expected credit losses over the remaining contractual life of the commitments taking into consideration the current funded balance and estimated exposure over the reasonable and supportable forecast period this process takes into consideration the same risk elements that are analyzed in the determination of the adequacy of the bancorps alll as previously discussed net adjustments to the reserve for unfunded commitments are included in provision for credit losses in the condensed consolidated statements of income goodwill business combinations entered into by the bancorp typically include the recognition of goodwill us gaap requires goodwill to be tested for impairment at the bancorps reporting unit level on an annual basis which for the bancorp is september and more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued impairment exists when a reporting units carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value in testing goodwill for impairment us gaap permits the bancorp to first assess qualitative factors to determine whether it is more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount in this qualitative assessment the bancorp evaluates events and circumstances which may include but are not limited to the general economic environment banking industry and market conditions the overall financial performance of the bancorp the performance of the bancorps common stock the key financial performance metrics of the bancorps reporting units and events affecting the reporting units to determine if it is not more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount if the quantitative impairment test is required or the decision to bypass the qualitative assessment is elected the bancorp performs the goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount including goodwill if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess limited to the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit a recognized impairment loss cannot be reversed in future periods even if the fair value of the reporting unit subsequently recovers the fair value of a reporting unit is the price that would be received to sell the unit as a whole in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date as none of the bancorps reporting units are publicly traded individual reporting unit fair value determinations cannot be directly correlated to the bancorps stock price the determination of the fair value of a reporting unit is a subjective process that involves the use of estimates and judgments particularly related to cash flows the appropriate discount rates and an applicable control premium the bancorp employs an incomebased approach utilizing the reporting units forecasted cash flows including a terminal value approach to estimate cash flows beyond the final year of the forecast and the reporting units estimated cost of equity as the discount rate significant management judgment is necessary in the preparation of each reporting units forecasted cash flows surrounding expectations for earnings projections growth and credit loss expectations and actual results may differ from forecasted results additionally the bancorp determines its market capitalization based on the average of the closing price of the bancorps stock during the month including the measurement date incorporating an additional control premium and compares this marketbased fair value measurement to the aggregate fair value of the bancorps reporting units in order to corroborate the results of the income approach the bancorp completed its annual goodwill impairment test as of september and concluded that the fair values of each of its reporting units exceeded their respective carrying amounts while the bancorp concluded that its goodwill was not impaired as of september further deterioration in economic conditions could significantly impact the impairment analysis and may result in future goodwill impairment charges that if incurred could have a material adverse effect on the bancorps results of operations in the period such charges are recognized refer to note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the bancorps goodwill managements discussion and analysis of financial condition

shortterm investments less the interest incurred on core deposits includes transaction deposits and other time deposits and wholesale funding includes certificates and over other deposits federal funds purchased other shortterm borrowings and longterm debt the net interest margin is calculated by dividing net interest income by average interestearning assets net interest rate spread is the difference between the average yield earned on interestearning assets and the average rate paid on interestbearing liabilities net interest margin is typically greater than net interest rate spread

and results of operations continued business segment review the bancorp reports on four business segments commercial banking branch banking consumer lending and wealth and asset management additional information on each business segment is included in note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements results of the bancorps business segments are presented based on its management structure and management accounting practices the structure and accounting practices are specific to the bancorp therefore the financial results of the bancorps business segments are not necessarily comparable with similar information for other financial institutions the bancorp refines its methodologies from time to time as managements accounting practices and businesses change the bancorp manages interest rate risk centrally at the corporate level by employing an ftp methodology the business segments are insulated from most benchmark interest rate volatility enabling them to focus on serving customers through the origination of loans and acceptance of deposits the ftp methodology assigns charge and credit rates to classes of assets and liabilities respectively based on the estimated amount and timing of cash flows for each transaction assigning the ftp rate based on matching the duration of cash flows allocates interest income and interest expense to each business segment so its resulting net interest income is insulated from future changes in benchmark interest rates the bancorps ftp methodology also allocates the contribution to net interest income of the assetgenerating and depositproviding businesses on a durationadjusted basis to better attribute the driver of the performance as the asset and liability durations are not perfectly matched the residual impact of the ftp methodology is captured in general corporate and other the charge and credit rates are determined using the ftp rate curve which is based on an estimate of fifth thirds marginal borrowing cost in the wholesale funding markets the ftp curve is constructed using the us swap curve brokered cd pricing and unsecured debt pricing the bancorp adjusts the ftp charge and credit rates as dictated by changes in interest rates for various interestearning assets and interestbearing liabilities and by the review of behavioral assumptions such as prepayment rates on interestearning assets and the estimated durations for indeterminatelived deposits key assumptions including the credit rates provided for deposit accounts are reviewed annually credit rates for deposit products and charge rates for loan products may be reset more frequently in response to changes in market conditions in general the charge rates on assets have declined since december as they were affected by the prevailing level of interest rates and by the duration and repricing characteristics of the portfolio the credit rates for deposit products also declined due to lower interest rates and modified assumptions thus net interest income for assetgenerating business segments improved while depositproviding business segments were negatively impacted during the nine months ended september the bancorps methodology for allocating provision for credit losses expense to the business segments includes charges or benefits associated with changes in criticized commercial loan levels in addition to actual net chargeoffs experienced by the loans and leases owned by each business segment provision for credit losses expense attributable to loan and lease growth and changes in alll factors is captured in general corporate and other the financial results of the business segments include allocations for shared services and headquarters expenses additionally the business segments

components of the risk management process are identify assess manage monitor and report the bancorp has also established processes and programs to manage and report concentration risks to ensure robust talent compensation and performance management and to aggregate risks across the enterprise fifth third drives accountability for managing risk through its three lines of defense structure the first line of defense is comprised of front line units that create risk and are accountable for managing risk these groups are the bancorps primary risk takers and are responsible for implementing effective internal controls and maintaining processes for identifying assessing controlling and mitigating the risks associated with their activities consistent with established risk appetite and limits the first line of defense also includes business units that provide information technology operations servicing processing or other support the second line of defense or independent risk

organization advising on controlling that risk and providing input on key risk decisions risk management complements the front lines management of risktaking activities through its monitoring and reporting responsibilities including adherence to the risk appetite additionally risk management is responsible for identifying measuring monitoring and controlling aggregate risks enterprisewide the third line of defense is internal audit which provides oversight of the first and second lines of defense and independent assurance to the board on the effectiveness of governance risk management and internal controls managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued credit risk management the objective of the bancorps credit risk management strategy is to quantify and manage credit risk on an aggregate portfolio basis as well as to limit the risk of loss resulting from the failure of a borrower or counterparty to honor its financial or contractual obligations to the bancorp the bancorps credit risk management strategy is based on three core principles conservatism diversification and monitoring the bancorp believes that effective credit risk management begins with conservative lending practices which are described below these practices include the use of intentional riskbased limits for single name exposures and counterparty selection criteria designed to reduce or eliminate exposure to borrowers who have higher than average default risk and defined weaknesses in financial performance the bancorp carefully designed and monitors underwriting documentation and collection standards the bancorps credit risk management strategy also emphasizes diversification on a geographic industry and customer level as well as ongoing portfolio monitoring and timely management reviews of large credit exposures and credits experiencing deterioration of credit quality credit officers with the authority to extend credit are delegated specific authority amounts the utilization of which is closely monitored underwriting activities are centrally managed and erm manages the policy and the authority delegation process directly the credit risk review function provides independent and objective assessments of the quality of underwriting and documentation the accuracy of risk grades and the chargeoff nonaccrual and reserve analysis process the bancorps credit review process and overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on quarterly assessments of the estimated losses expected in the loan and lease portfolio the bancorp uses these assessments to promptly identify potential problem loans or leases within the portfolio maintain an adequate allowance for credit losses and record any necessary chargeoffs the bancorp defines potential problem loans and leases as those rated substandard that do not meet the definition of a nonaccrual loan or a restructured loan refer to note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further information on the bancorps credit grade categories which are derived from standard regulatory rating definitions in addition stress testing is performed on various commercial and consumer portfolios utilizing various models for certain portfolios such as real estate and leveraged lending stress testing is performed by credit department personnel at the individual loan level during credit underwriting the following tables provide a summary of potential problem portfolio loans and leases table potential problem portfolio loans and leases as of september in millions carrying value unpaid principal balance exposure commercial and industrial loans commercial mortgage loans commercial construction loans commercial leases total potential problem portfolio loans and leases table potential problem portfolio loans and leases as of december in millions carrying value unpaid principal balance exposure commercial and industrial loans commercial mortgage loans commercial construction loans commercial leases total potential problem portfolio loans and leases in addition to the individual review of larger commercial loans that exhibit probable or observed credit weaknesses the commercial credit review process includes the use of two risk grading systems the first of these risk grading systems encompasses ten categories which are based on regulatory guidance for credit risk systems these ratings are used by the bancorp to monitor and manage its credit risk the bancorp also maintains a dual risk rating system for credit approval and pricing portfolio monitoring and capital allocation that includes a throughthecycle rating philosophy for assessing a borrowers creditworthiness a throughthecycle rating philosophy uses a grading scale that assigns ratings based on average default rates through an entire business cycle for borrowers with similar financial performance the dual risk rating system includes thirteen probabilities of default grade categories and an additional eleven grade categories for estimating losses given an event of default the probability of default and loss given default evaluations are not separated in the tencategory regulatory risk rating system the bancorp has also developed models to estimate expected credit losses as part of the bancorps adoption of asu measurement of credit losses on financial instruments on january for loans and leases that are collectively evaluated the bancorp utilizes these models to forecast expected credit losses over a reasonable and supportable forecast period based on the probability of a loan or lease defaulting the expected balance at the estimated date of default and the expected loss percentage given a default refer to note of the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for additional information about the bancorps processes for developing these models managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued estimating credit losses for periods beyond the reasonable and supportable forecast period and for estimating credit losses for individually evaluated loans for the commercial portfolio segment the estimated probabilities of default are primarily based on the probability of default ratings assigned under the throughthecycle dual risk rating system and historical observations of how those ratings migrate to a default over time in the context of macroeconomic conditions for loans with available credit the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected utilization rates which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions the estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions for collectively evaluated loans in the consumer and residential mortgage portfolio segments the bancorps expected credit loss models primarily utilize the borrowers fico score and delinquency history in combination with macroeconomic conditions when estimating the probability of default the estimates for loss severity are primarily based on collateral type and coverage levels and the susceptibility of those characteristics to changes in macroeconomic conditions the expected balance at the estimated date of default is also especially impactful in the expected credit loss models for portfolio classes which generally have longer terms such as residential mortgage loans and home equity and portfolio classes containing a high concentration of loans with revolving privileges such as credit card and home equity the estimate of the expected balance at the time of default considers expected prepayment and utilization rates where applicable which are primarily based on macroeconomic conditions and the utilization history of similar borrowers under those economic conditions the bancorp also utilizes various scoring systems analytical tools and portfolio performance monitoring processes to assess the credit risk of the consumer and residential mortgage portfolios overview us economic growth accelerated in the third quarter of as unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy
