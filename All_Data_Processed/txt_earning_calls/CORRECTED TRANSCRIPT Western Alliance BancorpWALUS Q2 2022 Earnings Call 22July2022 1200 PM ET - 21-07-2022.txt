to ken vecchione kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks miles we had solid performance this quarter as the company passed the billion asset milestone and the strong earnings power of our diversified assetsensitive business model was on display even as we are keenly focused on the economic uncertainty around us for the second quarter wal generated total net revenues of million net income of million and eps of record earnings were propelled by accelerating net interest income quarterly growth of million or from prior quarter to million as the rising rate environment expanded our net interest margin basis points to interest income rose times faster than interest expenses inclusive of deposit costs and ecrs we maintain industryleading performance with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital levels in the quarters to come balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly organic growth of billion or yearoveryear excluding the billion of loans transferred from held for sale to held for investment which was done to avoid income volatility from rising rate models dale will speak to this later deposits rose by billion or from the prior year as we continued to effectively attract and deploy liquidity loan growth was broadly diversified this quarter with regional banking divisions contributing of organic growth or million our specialized national business lines adding or almost billion and residential loans composing or billion excluding the held for sale transfers deposit growth trailed loan growth in our billion guide as a few large customers were pushed to july mortgage bankingrelated income modestly declined by million as the mortgage origination market continues to face headwinds from higher rates affordability issues and inventory constraints we believe the rationalization of the mortgage sector will take time but we have already positioned amerihome to profitably operate in a low origination market and to unlock value as a bankowned mortgage business by attracting custodial deposits and deploying liquidity into low credit risk loans finally asset quality continues to remain stable as total nonperforming assets declined million to basis points of total assets and net chargeoffs were only million we are cognizant of the macro uncertainties and possibly more difficult credit environment in the future but we have deliberately positioned the portfolio to withstand these pressures through creditlinked note issuance government guarantees and cash collateral that now cover of our portfolio in addition another of our loans are in low to no loss loan categories at this time dale will take you through our financial performance dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken for the quarter western alliance generated net income of million eps and ppnr of million total net revenue was million an increase of million during the quarter and million or yearoveryear net interest income increased million to million during the quarter driven by robust loan growth and the impact of higher rates on the margin western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 overall noninterest income declined million to million from the prior quarter driven primarily by a million loss on marktomarket adjustments for preferred securities as credit spreads widened and lower mortgage bankingrelated income which fell million during the quarter to million but this decline was partially offset by a million gain on credit recoveries related to credit linked notes sold during the quarter which is reported in noninterest income as really a contra expense to the provision for credit losses using the same cecl methodology finally noninterest expense increased million in the quarter resulting in an efficiency ratio of primarily due to higher deposit costs from earnings credit raises rates rose and processing expenses from a larger balance sheet all in net revenues grew out of the increase in expenses turning now to our net interest drivers our growing assetsensitive balance sheet benefited from the rising rate environment investment yields increased basis points from the prior quarter to on a linked quarter basis loan yields increased basis points to loans held for sale also benefited from rising mortgage rates and increased basis points to lending costs were higher with interestbearing deposit costs increasing basis points to while balances grew billion total cost of funds increased basis points to as the rate and utilization of shortterm borrowings increased as loan growth exceeded deposit growth net interest income increased million during the quarter or on annualized to million as average interest earning assets grew billion and nim expanded basis points to with our assetsensitivitys perspective our total funding costs inclusive of ecr expenses only grew of the million increase in interest income for the quarter after recent fed actions to rapidly increase interest rates we continued to remain materially assetsensitive since our variable rate loans moved above their floors given that the fed has increased rates by basis points since last quarter a proportion of variable rate loans at their floor is now only down from in q1 based upon expectations of an additional basis point rate increase by the fed next week nearly all of our loans will be at variable rate at that point in time in a rate shock scenario of basis points over months and on a static balance sheet net interest income is expected to rise using the same scenario on a growth balance sheet we expect nii to grow over under a plus basis point rate shock scenario on a static balance sheet net interest income is expected to climb by in the coming year and over if this rate environment were to materialize when balance sheet growth expectations are also incorporated our efficiency ratio fell to from in q1 due to rapidly increasing net interest income noninterest expenses rose million or during the quarter primarily due to an million increase in ecrrelated deposit costs noninterest bearing deposits and higher loan servicing and data processing expense from a larger balance sheet total deposits subject to ecr is billion at quarter end we expect our efficiency ratio to remain in the lower for preprovision net revenue was a record million during the quarter or increase from the same period last year an increase of million or quarteroverquarter this resulted in a ppnr roa of for the quarter an increase of basis points compared to in q1 despite our strong balance sheet growth in volatile rate environment our ppnr roa has remained quite stable over time western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 strong balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for sale held for investment increased billion net of the hfs to hfi loan transfer or to billion and deposit growth of billion brought balances back to billion at quarterend as ken mentioned during q2 we transferred billion of governmentguaranteed early buyout residential loans from the heldforsale to the heldforinvestment portfolio to eliminate the marktomarket volatility of hfs loans since these loans are targeted to reperform or roll off the balance sheet in various forms of liquidation they have significantly lower duration than other mortgages mortgage servicing rights balances declined million in the quarter ended to million as we optimized capital through certain msr portfolio sales total borrowings increased billion over the prior quarter to billion primarily due to an increase in shortterm borrowings of billion and the issuance of million in creditlinked notes providing first loss credit protection on a pool of billion in capital call loans and billion in residential loans finally tangible book value per share decreased or over the prior quarter to primarily due to unrealized fair value losses on availableforsale securities reported in all other comprehensive income tangible book value per share increased by yearoveryear we continue to generate attractive organic loan growth from our flexible commercial business strategy and see broadbased loan demand between our regional banking divisions and national business lines loans heldfor investment grew billion driven by an increase in ci loans of billion as demand for capital call lines and regional banking remained strong contributing billion and million to growth respectively commercial real estate loans grew million and residential grew billion representing of loan growth excluding the ebo transfer during the quarter we expect residential loans to remain at this lower proportion of loan growth going forward than it has been historically turning to deposits we continue to see deposit growth across our diversified channels that will generate stable lowcost funding in different rate environments through deep rooted banking relationships with our clients this quarter our specialty deposit national business lines drove most of the net deposit growth while regional banking divisions were flat in total deposits grew billion or annualized in the second quarter driven by increases in term cds of million interestbearing deposits of million and noninterest bearing dda of million noninterest bearing accounts comprised of our total deposit mix our specialty deposit franchises continue to provide ample opportunities to generate attractive funding to support loan growth with deposits from warehouse lending higher by million hoa up million and settlement services up million going forward we expect deposit growth more closely match our loan growth as is impacted by a few deferrals of new deposit relationships to the current quarter our asset quality continues to remain strong and total classified assets and special mention loans as a percentage of total assets and funded loans are lower than levels total classified assets declined million during the quarter to million or basis points of total assets as the temporary impact of the omicron variant on hotel loans continues to wane special mention loans decreased western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 million during the quarter to basis points of funded loans and were at historical lows as a percentage of assets if the economic environment continues to evolve we believe that our portfolio is structurally wellpositioned to sustain superior asset quality through cycles based on our deliberate decadelong business transformation and diversification strategy that emphasizes underwriting discipline our national reach and deep segment expertise enables selective relationships with the strongest counterparties leading profitability and superior company risk management approximately of our loans are in low to no loss categories and of the portfolio is credit protected through government guarantees credit linked notes personalized protection or as cash security we do not currently see signs of a notable recession or credit stress better prepared for these events should they arise quarterly net credit losses were billion or basis points of average loans our total loan allowance for credit losses increased million from the prior quarter to million as the provision exceeded losses due to strong loan growth and we adjusted economic exceptions for unexpected tail risks in all our total loan acls and funded loans declined basis points to basis points adjusting for the billion of loans covered by credit linked notes were ample first loss coverage is assumed by a third party the acl coverage ratio rises to finally given our industryleading return on equity and assets we continue to generate capital to fund organic growth and maintain wellcapitalized regulatory capital ratios our cet1 ratio was stable at as our net income and riskweighted assets reduction from credit linked notes offset the capital necessary to support our exceptional loan growth however our tangible common equity to total assets fell to this quarter reflecting negative fair value marks on available for sale securities its notable that the tce ratio does not consider the increased value of lowcost deposits in this higher rate environment inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of per share our tangible book value per share declined during the quarter to primarily reflecting the adverse available for sale mark at quarter end while rates have continued to rise the rate of increase we witnessed in the first quarter and the second should subside later this year given our robust capital generation we still expect that will again be a year of tangible book value growth ill now hand the call back to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale i was very pleased with the q2s results and the management teams ability to adapt to the changing interest rate and economic environments loan and deposit growth was strong net interest growth accelerated with expanding nim credit remains solid and clean and expenses were balanced for both nearterm efficiency and longterm investments looking forward we expect loans held for investments and deposits to grow in excess of billion per quarter our loan and deposit pipeline bolstered by client confidence gives us reassurance that our balance sheet will continue to grow in a safe sound and balanced manner net interest margin is expected to grow throughout the year accelerating net interest income growth and driving higher ppnr net interest income expansion in the third quarter is expected to exceed the increase in the second quarter strong net interest income growth will continue to drive total revenue higher inclusive of mortgage banking western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 slowdown mortgage bankingrelated income is likely to more closely track changes in overall mortgage sector volumes going forward the banks asset quality remains solid we are not seeing emerging delinquencies or defaults within any segment however we believe we are in a technical recession and are planning for a further slowdown and are prepared for a more dour economy if that occurs regarding capital we believe our internal capital generation can support up to billion to billion of loan growth depending on mix we expect capital ratios to remain fairly stable at current levels throughout the remainder of the year in conclusion we continue to see eps of for full year as a floor from which can ascend at this time dale tim and i would be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions please stand by while we compile the roster your first question comes from casey haire of jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning casey haire q analyst jefferies llc question on the funding strategy the borrowing is up billion at quarter end i know that everyone see short term and i think its overnight i was just wondering are those oneyear borrowings what is the spot rate at versus and then what is the appetite how aggressively are you going to use this going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so its two items in there one of them is we have some other credit linked notes are in there too but so of it really is predominantly federal home loan bank borrowings of a shortterm duration i expect that is basically kind of beta response to what were seeing we are that our loan growth is also overwhelmingly beta i do believe that that were going to see deposit growth and loan growth really kind of merge in the third quarter unlike the disparity we had in q2 so were comfortable continuing our growth strategy and over time i think that our funding from wholesale sources would probably wane western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so it sounds like borrowings whole lift level or not included and then potentially decline if you get good news on the deposit growth side dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i think theyre going to be trending lower we have initiatives that are underway and under development on deposits that i think are going to take hold im not sure were going to see much of a drop in the third quarter i think youre going to see more balance in loan to deposit increases kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey casey its ken were trying to balance loan growth and deposit growth but thats very hard to do and sometimes loan growth gets a little bit ahead of deposit growth in which case were going to use shortterm borrowings if we think the loans were putting on the balance sheet are good loans good asset quality so while we try to have a balanced approach any particular quarter we could be slightly out of balance casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and got your comments on the nii growth exceeding the level and but can you just give us a flavor for where asset yields are exiting the quarter specifically spot loan yields versus and then the hfs loan yields at versus the in the quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah sure so were looking for rates to be up kind of where were ending something in about basis points again thats going to get overwhelmed by what we expect to happen next week and we have dialed in another basis points in our estimates for the september meeting dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp remember were after july i think well almost be nearly above all the floors on the loans and thats going to add a little bit of an extra kick to the third quarter as well casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay all right last one for me just bigpicture question for you ken you guys you mentioned that youre planning for a slowdown just wondering i know you guys are a growth story and youve made some promises on the eps front and building on that in the next year but just wondering is there a thought to maybe get a little more aggressive on the acl build just given the overhang on credit normalization for western alliance kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 so id say a few things on the acl build ill give you a smaller answer and then ill give you a larger macro answer but on the acl build one remember that of our total loans happen to be credit protected so what you see in the acl is also offset in the fee income on the gain there thats number one number two a number of our loans certainly on the ci side have an average life of months so youre not going to see a big build there just because of the average life is so short and on the real estate side its an average life of a little more than threeandahalf years or so so we dont have long duration loans that will build up an acl or credit loss reserve and additionally what weve been doing for the last several years is focused on these low loss or no loss loans segments and when you go back and you look at history for the last years and use that to calculate your cecl provision the numbers are very low so we moved the provision up from million to million this quarter you saw we only had million of losses our special mention loans dropped and our classified assets dropped so i think were appropriately positioned at this time and i think the other provision will stay around this number as we go forward depending on loan growth dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i think our response to what happened during kind of during the pandemic and what you saw in terms of losses that we incurred which were almost nil i think really is borne out in terms of our underwriting strategy with really significant low ltv so i mean the hotel group is just such a good example here in terms of it was a direct hit from the pandemic occupancy rates fell into the low teens and yet we didnt lose a dime in that portfolio because we came in low in terms of advance rates we had strong sponsorship with entities with liquidity and that pervades the underwriting we do on our balance sheet so i mean as you know for the past years losses have been almost nil the ratio that we have today if you look at the duration of our loan book as ken mentioned under four years and the basis points were incurring on losses and then multiply that by four that would tell you that the reserve ratio would really only need to be a single digit number and here we are at basis points excluding the what we already have coverage on from the insurance of these credit linked loans casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great color thanks guys operator your next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america please go ahead ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning i just wanted to follow up one i think a few things that you mentioned i want to make sure we interpret this correctly one you expect loantodeposit ratio went from to you dont see that going higher given what you said about funding loans with deposits and secondly can you give us a sense of just the pace of loan growth when you think about the third and the fourth quarter the resi book is now all the way up to of the total loan portfolio so would love to hear just in terms of the pace of the loan growth and the makeup of that we are hearing from others around the slowdown in capital call line lending as well so any color would be helpful thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah first on the loantodeposit ratio if we execute our plans to have loans and deposits balance each other every quarter then is about the right level but i will say that there will be some quarters that could be out of balance and that number could go up a little bit or come down so in q1 for example we had billion of deposit growth and that exceeded loan growth so i think youll see it float around but dont be surprised if it should rise a little bit above that thats the first thing ebrahim second question was what again ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just the pace of loan growth and the makeup of loan growth now that mortgage has hit target that you had kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good okay our loan pipeline is very very strong and were talking about credit commitments that were going to be making that are straight down the middle of the fairway theyre not different than anything weve been doing for the last couple of years were not looking to steal someone elses market share on loan growth and do something that were not comfortable with and so the straight down the middle of the fairway loan growth is in front of us its going to come from capital call lines its going to come from our entertainment and media business line that we started off its going to come actually the national business lines are all showing good pipeline growth and some of the regions quite frankly and so what we get a chance to do here is pick the best of the best credit quality that we want to put on our balance sheet and so i think the loan growth will continue to grow billion is a floor and i see the amount of residential loans that comprise the billion to continue to drop and right now i would assume it wouldnt be any more than maybe ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it so theres a down of that growth and just on a separate note when we think about core expense outlook you talked about the low efficiency ratio is still good but just talk to i mean your nii guidance implies a pretty decent revenue lift give us a perspective of investment spend where expenses are going and beat hiring technology et cetera kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay so our we havent stopped investing in the company we havent stopped investing both for the short term and the longterm shorter things continued improvement in technology continue improvement in risk management we are keenly focused on crossing over the billion asset level and we need to be prepared for that well in advance and a lot of our spending is going into tech and risk management additionally were spending a lot of money on the deposit side of our national business lines putting in place new products and services that we think will be hopefully up and running either at the end of this year or maybe into the early part of so that has a little bit more of an intermediate outlook to it but were spending on that stuff today western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 nearer term you will see expenses rise a little bit and thats because the deposit costs are going to rise but when you look at that deposit cost rise in connection with very strong net interest income rising i think youll see efficiency ratio drift off somewhat in q3 and then come back down in q4 ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and just one quick followup the held for sale portfolio is that done declining after the transfer youve made or could we see held for sale balances continue to just lower kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah it will track the mortgage industry and it should stay roughly at the number it is today ebrahim poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay operator operator your next question comes from brad milsaps of piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hi brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale i was curious on deposits can you remind us what percentage of dda are subject to the earnings credit rate and maybe kind of what spot deposit rates were as you exited the quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah its approximately half the spot deposit rates were up about a little less than what we saw in the spot loan rates again were focused on is were not managing betas were managing net interest income growth ppnr and earnings per share and so were less concerned about that i do think that there is two different kinds of betas there is a beta to maintain a balance and then theres a beta to acquire new business western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 and since we are acquiring more business than other institutions were going to have a greater proportion of our growth come in at probably higher beta numbers in terms of the delta so again yeah the spot rates were up about basis points and going forward we expect to kind of continue to drive net interest income as ken indicated brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great and it looks like you added some more bonds in the quarter are you still adding variable bonds or i think it was about a third of the mix in the second quarter or the first quarter just curious if that was maintained dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp those were in the early part in q2 all are beta bonds basically collateralized loan obligations subject to only risk weighted assets categorization and that has basically stopped brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it and then the clns that you did i presume those were at the end of the quarter and didnt really have a huge impact in the quarter what were the rates there similar to the other credit linked notes that you did dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so the rates are basically sofr plus theres a little difference between them on each of them that isnt picked up in the total funding cost beta i mentioned earlier but youre right they were both done in june brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co got it and then maybe final question for me on the loan transfer i understand were in the marktomarket but as those loans yield themselves are they do they come off your books any differently than they would have otherwise is there something else you have to trigger or is it just goes back the same way it would have if it werent held for sale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah the reason why theyre so much shorter is because they had some type of a credit distress again these are guaranteed by ginnie mae so theres no risk to us and as a result youre going to get faster liquidation most of these are going to be sold probably by the current borrower i mean theyve got a good opportunity to do that if their personal situation has changed youre also going to see a good portion of them refinance debt now current rates to put them into probably a lower fee per loans or something like that and then also some of them are just going to go through kind of a foreclosure process we expect that to be about half of that total so those are either going to get remarked to current rates or move off completely the balance will probably be adjusted if we perform at the current note rate and those will have a longer life to them but half of them are going to have a shorter life so again it does as we said it kind of avoids the markto market effects on them and theres no risk of credit western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for the color operator your next question comes from timur braziler of wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc just following up on the credit linked notes dale if you can give us just some color as to how you choose the credits that these are applied to i know you gave us the balance of the capital call and the residential loans but whats the process in deciding which credits you choose to go the credit linked route versus traditional kind of dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp sure so i mean a key feature of this basic strategy is to reduce the riskweighted assets of these so we want to pick something that we can get good leverage on riskweighted asset reduction and we also want something that the expectation of losses is probably low to begin with such that the rates that we pay on the note this sofr plus is lower and if you had something that was maybe more uncertain in terms of what the credit risk was maybe that note rate is going to have to be higher to cover that so thats how we kind of got into these weve seen where has the trail been placed already residential real estate and we did one last year in warehouse lending weve seen those before were not aware of anyone thats actually done one domestically for capital call lines but we thought that would work well too in terms of kind of queuing that up and weve been active in that space and i think its working well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp let me just add one followon to the excuse me for a second let me just add one followon to the credit linked notes we went down that path mostly to bolster our capital positions but i want to make sure its not lost on folks that because of the three deals that weve done and the several deals weve done to stock four deals that weve done since last year of our book of business is now insured i dont think theres a bank that can say weve western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 just done that we know what we were looking so over of their book has credit insurance on it and so the very important aspect to what weve done really gives us a lot of confidence around our asset quality kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp by getting relief on riskweighted assets has saved us million in capital timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for that color maybe switching over to bridge just to see that the lending activity is still pretty strong what did deposits do out of that business kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so tech and innovation loans just had a very small outflow this quarter of million just over million and yeartodate deposits over our bridge have remained rather steady so theyre really flat to the beginning of the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and do you have the warehouse balances at quarter end mortgage warehouse balances kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah we do when we talk about warehouse lending we group it with two other categories because its run by the same manager so we have warehouse lending in there we have msr lending and we have notes finance lending i dont think weve ever provided information on each one of those things broken out and so i would for competitive reasons rather not do that but say to you that on a cumulative basis those three groups those three things msr note finance and warehouse lending were up for the quarter timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just lastly for me im glad to see that ive made it to this part of the call before you get your first amerihome question but with production kind of being more or less flat sequentially and a pretty marked reduction in the gain on sale margin are we nearing the bottom kind of on gain on sale revenue and then for the msr revenue if you can provide a breakout of kind of whats core versus what was the fair value adjustment for the quarter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so as weve said i think almost from day one we look at everything together and its mortgage banking revenue and i would say that based upon the industry data that we are seeing and what we are seeing in daytoday activity there will be a natural drifting downward from the numbers that we posted in q2 all that was taken into account when we provided the floor of the eps guide western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay thank you for the questions operator your next question comes from chris mcgratty of kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great ken i want to come back to the for a minute and just make sure i understand all the pieces you talk about the investments that youre making you talk about the conservatism youre making on the provision but then you say that the nii increase in q3 is going to be larger than q2 to me it feels like that number should be decently higher than and so im interested in some color there and i think in prior calls youve talked about like i think a fourth quarter run rate just maybe an update would be great kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think by the way we started putting out the floor number and the keyword there is floor in the back half of we havent moved off of that and while i keep direct you to the word floor so at this point we feel very comfortable at saying that is a floor number there are some upward biases that you could see in our pl that could raise that number and our q4 number exiting q4 i think is is not higher than that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay is there anything youre doing in the back half of the year just because the nii momentum is so significant to set up for maybe some expense the easing of expenses next year since this year is kind of youre going to hit that number are you doing things in the back half i guess to make the comp easier for next year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no i mean weve been running the business for the long term for the longest time so projects that we have in place have been in place probably since going back to some of them and that continue to be invested in so were not accelerating expenses to offset revenue the acceleration in revenue i think youll see a little higher as i said expense growth but just because of deposit costs and the ecr credits but that will be more than made up in the net interest income growth the provision is something that we continue to look at and the provision is also predicated upon loan growth and again were looking at a billion loan growth floor so the provision could be equal to about where we are for q2 going forward and q3 and q4 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and if i could sneak one in for dale i know you manage the nii but one of the themes in the quarter has been peak margins for the industry when do we get there and maybe just interested in your thoughts about the cadence of the margin given the futures curve and when you think timing and about where that would occur western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well yeah were fairly in the longest leg of this uptrend right now and maybe that starts to have in the fourth quarter or first i do think that there may be a little bit of momentum even after that as say fixed rate loans kind of repriced at higher levels weve had this floor strategy that was so successful during the pandemic but right now when rates are moving as quickly the floors fall away from the current variable rate very fast and theyre not of much use so i would prefer that we kind of flatten out here for maybe the first half of next year and then maybe drill down from then and maybe thats a little optimistic in terms of how fast we get through this but i think its probably early in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks dale operator operator instructions your next question comes from brandon king of truist securities please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey i wanted to get a sense of the composition of deposit growth going forward ive noticed most of the growth in the quarter came from cds money market accounts and savings so i was curious if thatll be kind of a similar composition for the back half of the year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i think its going to be a little more balanced to our current mix i dont think cds are going to be as large a piece i think it is probably going to be money market and some interestbearing checking i would say theyre kind of garnering real dda without an ecr in this environment with a very elevated level of awareness of whats happened with rates is probably challenging so i dont think were going to hold that mix of dda but i dont think its going to be as skewed to cds as what you just saw brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it and then just broader picture looking on to next year i noticed comments on the strong pipeline nearer term for this year but is there any sort of possibility of slowing loan growth depending on if we get a more severe downturn next year is that a potential or do you think you could continue to achieve this growth even if we get some sort of a mildtomoderate recession next year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp this is ken im going to let tim bruckner our chief credit officer that hardly gets a chance to speak take that one timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 thanks ken hi its a good question we have focused the whole business on appropriate lending in every economic circumstance so theres things naturally that we will do less of as we head into what might be a recessionary economy and theres segments that we began adjustments in the second half of last year so weve already seen muted volume in some segments we will achieve appropriate balance really for any economic scenario but we do that in a deliberate way and we do it in advance brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay so i get the sense that you could achieve the same loan growth but just the composition would change is that fair to say timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah thats definitely possible we would generally be less aggressive in stressed economic circumstance so if that presents youd see likely a little bit less a little more deliberate and a little higher margin kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp weve been doing this what im about to say for the last four or five years but we break loan commitments into a couple of different categories the first and easiest one is insurable risk which is what the clns are thats on one end of the spectrum on the other end of the spectrum are economicsensitive loans tied more to the economy and so weve been pulling back on that for a while now and so less growth will come from that and then our middle two categories are what we call economic resilience and economic timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah resistant kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp resistant sorry and so we balance what we we balance our loan growth into those categories to ensure that we can grow in a very balanced and safe manner and as i said weve been doing this for several years now so entering into a downturn theres an intellectual curiosity on our part that i think we prepared the balance sheet for the stresses that are going to come forward tim timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp id like to take you back to one thing that you said when we talked about acl and its important as foundational to the way that we underwrite here we have a short tenured portfolio very deliberately we underwrite in the current economic circumstance we underwrite within our line of sight underwriting to the short tenor permits that it also lets us reset those assets that are on our books in an inappropriate way based on the current economic circumstance so it all really ties together thanks ken brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for the color western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you brandon operator your next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning i wanted to kind to flip over to the margin question and just thinking out whether it be next year or if we get lower rates anything any thoughts around doing anything to protect some of the margin gains that youre going to generate over the next several quarters in that scenario dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp sure sure i mean sometimes those are more difficult to climb without the benefit of hindsight but we would we would look for that we put on a few billion dollars of swaps when we could get term swaps threeyear deals or basis points and that seems to have made sense now obviously in retrospect so and there we have multiple ways to do that one of which of course is just to shift the mix of what were engaged in so we maybe go back to a heavier residential component then we could also put in swaps i think what i think is most attractive about our business model is our ability to pivot that we have these different business lines and just like during the pandemic when things changed rates fell everyone else is pulling back on credit we said okay lets go to capital call or lets go to residential real estate really safe assets and we sustained loan growth throughout that period of time we think were in a good maybe a situation as you mentioned on the timing i think its probably before the presidential election that well certainly see a turn i think wed like to be in that scenario and we may play that card again gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co all right thank you and then secondly just in terms of casa pay i wonder if you could kind of provide any progress update there in terms of integration launch et cetera and kind of customer reception at this point kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well sure so we have some clients on it i would say that its still under beta testing of some sort so were its not a big number we didnt talk about it for that reason we have nominal kind of deposit balances from that space presently but despite the volatility thats taken place we think theres a probably a big opportunity for stablecoins in financial services going forward gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you operator your next question comes from jon arfstrom of rbc capital markets please go ahead western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thanks good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc couple of quick ones can you go back to the message you want us to take away on q3 expenses ken you kind of alluded to it but i just want to make sure i understand it it sounds like youre talking about a step up in q3 and how material you want us to think through that how material is that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so expenses are going to rise as deposit cost rise and the impact of the ecr changes that are happening at the end of q2 take hold into q3 and as i said those deposit costs are going to earn their way back to the bottom of the pl through net interest income and so i guess i would tell you dont get pulse and always just curious look at the efficiency ratio here because it will move up in q3 but it will then come back down to about where we are now in q4 so for us its looking at the net interest income thats being generated from interest expense and incremental deposit costs as we said in q2 that was a to ratio probably as we go forward in q3 and q4 that ratio will compress somewhat it wont be to but it should be above to to and so thats what were focused on and just you give me a platform here jon so im going to take it and that is we are just focused very heavily on net interest income growth and pushing that net interest income growth down to the bottom line and preparing us also for jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay got it i appreciate that and then the last one i think this is probably a platform for dale but in that your comments about capital and your tce ratio and aoci impact you talked about not marking your lowcost deposits twopart question do you feel like the tce ratio where it sits now does that limit you at all in terms of how you run the company and then the second thing is what kind of a value would you put on your deposit base dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no i dont think the tce ratio limits our capacity im sure youre aware theres a number of banks including some of the global cities that are a point below us or nearly a point below us so we think there is kind of latitude there ours have been primarily driven by the aoci mark we have had strong growth but i think that can come down i think the kind of the regulatory view the one that were focused on is really the dominator is riskweighted assets and thats kind of the cet1 level so yeah we feel strongly about that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i would say we target at or around for cet1 jon and thats what were more focused on jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and that drives us to making decisions about riskweighted assets which drives us to the clns it all gets combined together which drives us to insuring of our portfolio so when you take down the waterfall thought thats how we think about it when you think about a cet1 ratio jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then any bigger picture thoughts on your deposit base dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so yeah i mean weve had a number of different initiatives that weve had i think strong success with weve got some more queued up and we think were going to have kind of continued growth with what weve had already we acquired digital disbursements in the first quarter were still seeing that kind of coming to fruition in terms of accelerating that performance and were our philosophy has been having a strong stable kind of core deposit franchise really gives you the opportunity to underwrite big credits and that has to change thats been going on for quite a while a few years and we expect that to kind of rebalance with where weve been in loans kind of going forward so were looking forward to it and we think this is a good opportunity for us to shine the volatility is something that we can make our way through we think better than most as we have more opportunities to pivot where appropriately jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right ill just leave it there thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator there are no further questions at this time ill turn the conference back over to ken vecchione for closing remarks kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected
