on the call today will focus on adjusted operating results and with that ill turn it over to jim james michael cracchiolo chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc good morning and thanks for joining our first quarter call ill begin by sharing that ameriprise delivered another good quarter and a solid start to the year as youve seen the economic environment remains strong but the global equity markets are more volatile both given the impacts of the russian invasion of ukraine and the higher inflation that were experiencing here in the united states as well as globally in fact the bloomberg us aggregate experienced its largest single quarterly loss in over years in this climate the fed has finally begun to raise shortterm rates which is appropriate theyve been slow to take action and signaling that theyll have to get more aggressive before i discuss the quarter id like to acknowledge the horrific situation in ukraine ameriprise vehemently condemns the atrocities being committed by russia and our thoughts are with the ukrainian people and all who have been affected our focus has been on supporting humanitarian relief i should note we dont have staff or conduct business in ukraine or russia and our direct exposure is extremely limited lets move to the first quarter results were in a very good position to kick off the year and weve been able to execute very well during this volatile time client activity remained very strong we continue to generate good results were investing for growth and executing our plans and serving clients really well and that resulted in good asset growth and strong financial performance total assets under management and administration were up revenues were up double digits earnings per share was up and roe is terrific at all in strong results in a challenging market environment let me now turn to advice wealth management we delivered another strong quarter with the volatility picking up its important for us to be engaged with our clients and advisors theyre leveraging the tools and solutions that we invested in over the last number of years that we told you about we had strong activity in flows in the quarter and good client acquisition particularly in our 500000plus market i know that our advisors have been doing a level of reallocation and rebalancing thats appropriate in clients portfolios and in fact we saw good flows coming in and cash balances have picked up which is appropriate at this point so let me give you some of the numbers total client assets were up to billion client inflows were strong up to billion wrap net inflows of billion was strong in a more volatile environment and even though theyre a bit lower than a year ago clients are holding more cash as you would imagine transactional activity was impacted a bit but its only down ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 as markets stabilize we expect to see more cash going back to work high cash balances present a significant revenue opportunity for us as we move through and beyond in total cash balances increased to nearly billion up more than billion from a year ago and as the fed continues to raise shortterm rates we expect to see a meaningful lift in earnings with this backdrop our advisor productivity growth reached another new high of which is terrific with regard to recruiting we continue to demonstrate the attractiveness of our advisor value proposition with another experienced advisors joining us in the quarter the pipeline continues to look good and in our surveys of advisors who have joined us over out of advisors have said they have better technology financial planning capabilities and ability to acquire clients more easily than they did at their prior firms one of the things im proud of is how we consistently work with our clients and our strong client satisfaction its great to see that newsweek has named us one of americas most trusted companies that complements our investors business daily number one trusted wealth manager ranking and earlier this year we launched a new ad campaign advice worth talking about thats telling our story even more broadly in the marketplace we showcase that out of of our clients are likely to recommend ameriprise to their family or friends and a few weeks ago we released our money family research on generational wealth that underscores the significant need for holistic advice in the marketplace which plays to our strength turning to the bank total assets grew to billion in the quarter up more than billion from a year ago we continue to have good demand for our pledge loans with balances increasing nicely in the quarter the bank presents a significant opportunity as a longterm growth driver within wealth management and provides additional flexibility in this rising rate environment to wrap up advice wealth management our financials are good pre tax income was up and we generated a strong margin above up basis points lets turn to asset management now we like others have experienced the market volatility and the risk of headwinds given the geopolitical environment it has affected us and the industry largely in retail but overall based on the strong progress weve been making over the last number of quarters we saw good growth in assets up our longterm investment performance continues to show good consistency with our and 10year time periods and over of our funds were above median on an assetweighted basis our 1year performance did slip a bit based on the volatility out there and the rotation from growth to value given our quality growth positioning in certain equity funds especially in europe but our investment teams feel good about their positioning as they manage through a tough market environment lets turn to flows where were out about million in the first quarter reflecting the pressure youve seen in the industry in retail we were out billion in terms of us retail our gross sales slowed and we saw a pickup in redemptions similar to the industry our flow rate was slightly better in terms of active peers in equities and slightly worse in fixed income we havent really played in a large way in the short duration market or the leveraged loan area however we benefited from the remaining piece of the us asset transfer that was part of our bmo transaction and which is largely included in our retail numbers this quarter in emea retail net outflows improved a bit in the uk however they worsened in continental europe given the riskoff environment gross flows have certainly slowed for the industry and were seeing similar pressure yes ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 retail flows are a bit challenged but we have a strong lineup of funds and good engagement with distribution partners advisors and gatekeepers when the markets start to stabilize well be in a good position turning to global institutional excluding legacy insurance partners net inflows were billion as investors look through the current volatility we had some good wins but there were some asset allocation calls as youd expect and we experienced some redemptions weve added to a number of our rated strategies and similar to retail were having good engagement with clients and prospects globally our investment performance is key to this and its being recognized we did well in recent barrons rankings and five columbia strategies earned us refinitiv lipper fund awards with four as repeat winners with regard to bmo emea integration were on track the combined senior management team is in place and we announced that we will rebrand the bmo global asset management emea business to columbia threadneedle investments in july so for asset management were focused on our clients executing our plans and generating good financials and returns for ameriprise pretax operating earnings were up and margins were above and thats with the full quarter of bmo in the numbers moving to retirement protection solutions were seeing good results ill start with variable annuities i want to mention again that we discontinued products with living benefit riders at yearend we had some sales in the pipeline that came in in january but that tapered off as we moved through the quarter given the environment we had good sales in our rava product without living benefits as well as our structured products overall our sales were down but that should be expected given the volatility and a move away from living benefit guarantees in protection we continue to have strong sales in the quarter coming off a positive year were seeing good activity our life sales were up weve been focused on our vul and di products which are good margin and return businesses for us and appropriate for clients in this environment in terms of earnings were up in line with our expectations financial results and free cash flow were good particularly given the volatility and our move away from living benefits so overall for ameriprise in terms of our capital positioning we feel really good about continuing to give back to shareholders at an attractive rate we returned million in the quarter which is substantial and with that we raised our dividend up our 18th increase since becoming a public company in so overall as i began our conversation i think ameriprise delivered another good quarter even with this changing landscape i think were situated very well our advice value proposition and highquality solutions are necessary and key in this environment and with that we feel very well positioned to satisfy our client objectives in looking over the past cycles we have consistently performed well especially during volatile periods im confident that this will continue based on our strategic investments our focus on execution and serving clients holistically and our balance sheet strength now walter will review the numbers in more detail and then well take your questions ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 walter stanley berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim ameriprise delivered strong financial results across the firm with adjusted operating eps up to despite significant market uncertainty in the quarter our core wealth and asset management businesses delivered strong profitable growth representing nearly of ameriprises earnings in the quarter in the quarter these businesses demonstrated the strength of the underlying business model and ongoing execution of our growth strategies and our retirement protection solutions business continues to perform well with a differentiated risk profile our balance sheet fundamentals are excellent with significant excess capital of billion this allows ameriprise to consistently return substantial capital to shareholders as we plan to return approximately of adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in lets turn to slide where you can see that we continue to generate strong growth in both earnings and profitability in our growth businesses of wealth and asset management revenues in these businesses grew to billion with pretax operating earnings of million up this drove a blended margin of up basis points from a year ago lets turn to the individual segment performance beginning with wealth management on slide these strategies we have in place to support advisors and improve their productivity using bestinclass tools and technology continue to generate strong organic results despite the challenging macro environment we generated very strong client flows of billion in the quarter client assets grew to billion and our advisor force continued to deliver exceptional productivity growth with revenue per advisor reaching in the quarter up from the prior year on slide you can see that our business fundamentals are fueling continued strong financial results and wealth management adjusted operating net revenues grew to billion from robust client flows which were supplemented by yearoveryear market growth however transactional activity declined a bit given the uncertain market environment in the quarter in the face of volatile markets we saw cash balances increase to nearly billion which is counter to the typical seasonal pattern where cash balances generally dip in the first quarter high cash balances should provide a substantial and immediate benefit based upon the feds anticipated increase in short rates for the remainder of based upon the markets expectation of three 50basis point increase followed by two 25basis point increases in the balance of the year we would expect an additional benefit to pretax earnings exceeding million in but that is subject to change if the fed takes different actions this would help offset the impact if markets pull back further this year in addition this provides flexibility for us to optimize the benefit from rising rates across offbalance sheet brokerage cash the bank and certificates it will enable us to invest across duration where we see attractive opportunities and capital is not a constraining factor for us ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 in the first quarter we brought billion of brokerage sweep balances onto the bank balance sheet that we put to work in three and fouryear duration strategies earning nearly in april rate opportunities increased to the mid to high range expenses remain well managed ga expense increased from higher volumebased expenses and business growth over the past year as we move through we will continue to manage expenses in light of the revenue environment while equity markets remain volatile at this point we expect a significant tailwind from rising rates to offset marketrelated revenue pressure overall wealth management profitability remained strong with pretax adjusted operating earnings of million up from last year pretax operating margin expanded basis points to lets turn to asset management on slide where we maintained strong profitability despite market conditions total assets under management increased to billion reflecting net inflows and the acquisition of bmo emea in the quarter asset management net outflows were billion including billion of outflows from legacy insurance partners underlying flows were flat as continued strength in institutional offset retail outflows as we like the industry saw pressures from global market volatility a riskoff investor sentiment and geopolitical strain in emea margins in the quarter were strong at and in line with what we indicated in the fourth quarter given the full quarter bmo impacts in our results on slide you see asset management continued to deliver strong financial performance adjusted operating revenues increased to billion reflecting the cumulative benefit of net inflows and business growth strong performance fees and market appreciation the fee rate in the quarter was basis points excluding performance fees this is consistent with guidance provided in the fourth quarter regarding the addition of bmo assets which are largely institutional expenses remain well managed and in line with expectations given the revenue growth ga expenses were up as a result of two items the bmo acquisition and higher performance compensation pretax adjusted operating earnings were million up demonstrating the underlying strength of our business growth and performance fees lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions include blocks of business with a differentiated risk profile the business performed well with pretax adjusted operating earnings of million up slightly from a year ago given market appreciation and lower distribution expense from lower sales our focus remains optimizing our risk profile and shifting our business mix to lower risk offerings variable universal life product sales increased over which now represent a third of total insurance inforce variable annuity sales declined reflecting the uncertain market environment as well as our decision to exit manufacturing products with living benefit riders account value of living benefit riders represent only of the overall book down another basis points from last year this mix in sales and account values for both retirement protection products is expected to continue now lets move to the balance sheet on slide our balance sheet fundamentals remain excellent we had holding company available liquidity of billion and excess capital of billion at the end of the quarter our diversified highquality aa rated investment portfolio remains well positioned and our va hedge effectiveness ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 was in the quarter these strong fundamentals allow us to deliver consistent and differentiated level of capital return to shareholders yesterday we announced an increase in our quarterly dividend and as i mentioned we remain on track to return approximately of the adjusted operating earnings to shareholders in with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin our questionandanswer session operator instructions and we have our first question from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question walter you indicated million pretax earnings benefit from higher rates in wealth management is that your expectation versus the run rate or would that be versus where things were on the january call when the forward curve was less hawkish and thats a impact right so given the timing of the hikes wed see greater impact in is that fair walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc it really is more an indication of what the fed has recently announced as it relates to the short end with the indiscernible and seeing the benefit in this year and youre right you would then get the calendarization full impact as you get into we will also get the benefit as were seeing it now because in the quarter we did see a substantial increase in the spreads for the long end so we will pick that up as we start shifting money from offbalance sheet to on balance sheet so i think its going to be a combination of both will allow us to garner that additional profitability but again these are estimates based on a lot of variables brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure sure of course thats fair thanks for that and then for my second question pledged loans new product for you and might be on a different trajectory but theres been some concerns about across the industry what rising rates might do for demand for those products so what are you hearing from your advisors as shortterm rates are likely to rise and how are those efforts to educate your advisors on the merits of the offering going walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so far were seeing continued demand for our pledge activity margin activity so we have not seen any negative impact and certainly we continue our advisors are very knowledgeable about the tradeoff of bm to leverage and use that capability to investment in the market but so far we have not seen weve seen good growth coming in from pledge and from margin ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for taking my questions operator erik bass with autonomous research erik bass q analyst autonomous research hi thank you given the weaker market performance yeartodate and the turn in asset flows do you believe sustaining an asset management margin in the low range is still achievable walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well obviously it will our range is as we always talk about is to and we said we were getting the benefit of the higher market appreciation so you would imagine if the markets where you trade continue to go down it will go down again we have ways to go to still stay within our ranges that we talked about erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it and i think you noted in the slides that the bmo acquisition is performing above expectations can you just provide some more color on this where has the performance been better and has anything changed in terms of your expectations around earnings accretion walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc okay so its on multiple fronts obviously they have garnered some very good inflows in this environment as we talked about weve had institutional inflows coming in that would have been very good in ldi and other areas and weve also had the us transfer came in so those have been very good the profitability has been totally on target actually a little better than we want our indiscernible and as we look at the elements of the performance fees that came in and that was certainly strong profitability coming off private equity and property so it is performing well and then as were looking through integration we have our plans set and were moving through that and certainly moving through our strategy to get our synergies so were feeling very comfortable about the acquisition at this stage erik bass q analyst autonomous research thank you and was this the last quarter youd expect the us transfers to come in or are there any more that we should expect going forward walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc this is basically it we believe ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 erik bass q analyst autonomous research got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to start off with a question just on the recruiting outlook some of your peers had indicated earlier in the quarter that recruiting had slowed pretty dramatically given some of the elevated volatility particularly in january february but the organic growth the net advisor adds you delivered in the quarter admittedly more resilient than we were anticipating i was hoping you could just speak to some of the factors that drove more resilient organic growth trends over the course of the quarter and maybe just your on a longerterm basis youre confidence in sustaining 5plus organic growth given some of the strong recruitment trends that we saw james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc okay so i think you had sort of two parts in that one is around the recruiting and then around i guess the organic growth just from flows so yeah we at the beginning of the quarter was always a little to start off the year based on what weve seen as some of the volatility that occurred in january and then we were able to really pick that up as we got through the quarter and we had good quality people come join us our pipeline still looks pretty good as we continue to move forward i mean theres been a greater level of volatility as you saw in the month of april but i think that were having good conversations with people they understand the value of what we can provide them and the type of support that we provide for people who have joined us regarding the organic flow activity in general as you would imagine when you have a pickup of volatility and you got a little more unknown you have a little bit holding on cash not going necessarily to work or the idea that people want to put a lot more money in the market if its going to sort of fall the next day but our overall client activity has held up the engagement is good i just think the volatility will always cause a little bit of a slowing in how people are thinking about it im not sure how youre thinking about it whether youre putting a lot of money to work right now if you have a little bit more of the unknown but i do believe that since the engagement is strong the conversations are good and the client relationships are good and were actually gaining more client relationships that those flows will be there over time whether theres a little slowdown because of this period of the unknown is a usual occurrence so we feel good our assets stay with us i think people are seeking the advice that we provide and its just more of what happens in a particular month or quarter or week but i think you see that that is something that we can sustain steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color and just for my followup on the brokerage cash sweeps into the bank was hoping you could just help frame what level of sweeps we should modeling over the course of the year as you continue to scale the bank given that high reinvestment yield assumption you had alluded to earlier and as we think about just the ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 pace of fed tightening what expectation should we be underwriting just for both deposit betas and cash sorting or yieldseeking behavior as we get deeper into the tightening cycle based on your historical experience walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc all right so from a bank standpoint weve already moved from offbalance sheet to onbalance sheet about billion we are evaluating we have a range or you can get into billion to billion that we think would be applicable here that we would start evaluating that tradeoff because the bank is giving us that opportunity to balance to pickup our yield from that standpoint and so that is something that you should expect that we will be targeting to do in as you indicated the yields are up and certainly those yields have low risk profiles as weve continued to manage that so it would give us a good balance between the increase in shortterm and picking up the spread with lowrisk and low duration because well stay in the ph to year range on the duration and thats the sweet spot thats working out very well for us steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc and with regards to this data is it yieldseeking behavior with the expectation for the level of cash balances as we get deeper into the tightening cycle walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah our if youre looking from our standpoint with the offbalance sheet cash and the stability of that it is quite good it is again its more working capital and certainly its built up over the years but this is something we feel very comfortable with the amount that i mentioned that we can shift that gives us more than enough liquidity buffer to manage that steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks so much for taking my questions operator the next question is from andrew kligerman with credit suisse andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc hey good morning just following up on that bank question walter you just mentioned a billion to billion tradeoff and as im looking at these bank assets or deposits going from billion last year to billion this year and as you mentioned its up just billion in the quarter alone when you said billion to billion tradeoff are you indicating that theres a good possibility over the course of the year you could add another billion to billion walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so if youre ill take your number billion if i add billion to billion you can go to the upper range of billion ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thats great and in terms of recruiting you were touching on that a bit earlier too jim and it is a tight labor market so could you touch on what youre seeing in terms of bringing in new advisors de novo is that a big initiative at this stage in the game and just given this environment is there comfort in gaining advisors from other firms james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so we have continued to recruit in novice advisors as well as assistants and even our franchisee channel and help develop them as part of the franchisee systems as well and as we do with the employee side and we will continue that we havent made that an extended large part of our activities but its a nice complement to our activities and were seeing some good people join us that way and on the experience side we continue to i think have a very strong value proposition as i mentioned in my opening remarks weve gone out to the advisors whove joined us and they are highly satisfied in what weve been able to provide much better than what they got at their previous firms either wirehouses or independents and so that story were telling that in the marketplace were not just its not just about what the payment is its about what someone can establish themselves here and actually grow and have a very strong productive practice with a quality type of profile and so again were not looking to just add large numbers were rolling up people based on even have low productivity were looking for quality people that really want to manage a really good franchise or become a highly productive employee as part of our system with all the support that we can provide them and so we feel good about that andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc so amidst all this economic noise you can likely continue to grow that channel james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes yes andrew kligerman q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc awesome thanks operator well move to our next question from john barnidge with piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much theres been some thought that energy issues in europe may increase demand and interest in esg investing i know bmo had a large esg product portfolio can you maybe talk about how demand for that product has been versus others broadly and maybe specifically in europe thank you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so part of the bmo acquisition was actually adding to our capabilities in responsible investing and their portfolios are doing well they are garnering good flows there where its been a little softer in other areas in europe and very clearly its one of the areas that were working on to leverage more holistically across our international franchise but even so in the united states and so we feel good that thats a part of what we can further leverage in the environment that were continuing to move into as demand also picks up in that area i think energy is one part of that but there is the e theres the s and g part of it and thats an important part of overall responsible investing john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then my followup question given the market volatility can you maybe talk about asset management timeline for unfunded to funded how thats sitting versus maybe three to six months ago thank you james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so on the institutional side of the business as you would imagine there is always a little bit of a trying to recognize whats happening in the market and how funds need to be reallocated or even where you have won something it sometimes takes a little longer just based on the market conditions to fund i havent necessarily seen a further extension in that regard things have been funding i wouldnt say they quickened at all but i wouldnt say theyve extended themselves i think theres always certain portfolios as you have a backup in the fixed income market or you have some reallocation in some parts of the equity segments but i think its been running consistently for where it was over the last six months john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you operator your next question is from tom gallagher with evercore thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi good morning the drop in insurance and annuity distribution fees it sounds like some level of that is going to be sustained at a lower level given youre exiting the guaranteed va product sales any color you can give there on what percentage of the move there of the downward move you think might remain depressed versus potentially getting some recovery on the other pieces walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well i cant really give you a percentage but certainly exiting the living benefits will certainly eliminate that aspect but we are seeing strength in the sva product so i cant really give you the exact proportionalities on them tom ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and tom i think in the first quarter i think youll see across the industry a bit more slowing in annuity activity because of the volatility so part of that is part of it and then part of it was the guarantees versus the pickup in the nonguarantee activity but we feel very comfortable with that and we think its the right tradeoff for us as we continue to move forward but there will be some expense savings as well from not booking some of the new business so overall we feel very good about that move and the total balance of what we think that we can continue to garner there thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi got you any color you can give on just overall outlook for flows between institutional and retail on the asset management side not to overreact but there was definitely a pretty sharp drop in oneyear performance if you look at the statistics there which i would imagine probably wont have a big nearterm impact but any color between the two pieces of the business in terms of where you think flows are going should we expect overall then to remain depressed here for a while james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so the oneyear performance so we know its more of what had occurred more quickly it didnt really affect the flow situation in that regard i think the flows and you can see it across the industry youre going to have a little pickup of redemptions as people say hey maybe i need to get out and particularly if you look at fixed income theres been a major pullout on some sectors of the fixed income market including munis et cetera you also had a bit slowing of people investing in lets say growth stocks at this point in time based upon how theyve pulled back so i think that should be expected i think as you see more people reporting youre going to see that i think you can see that in the ph sims data what i did say is that our level of flows is consistent with the industry we were better in equities if were looking at the us and were worse in fixed income and i mentioned the difference in the segments so i actually dont think we had a major pullup compared to the industry i think the industry is falling off as well now the other point and this is active were talking about active now the other thing i would say is on the performance side there are three things that occur number one in europe there isnt a segment that calls growth and value and they its all meshed together we have a little more of a growth quality bias versus more of a value and so when you look at the european and you benchmark it we had a little more underperformance there because were a little more growthoriented our institutional and our retail clients understand that a little more but on the benchmarking it just shows that your performance goes down then in the us we have one big fund which is in the 50th its not way below it just dropped and it will go back its a few basis points and thats what caused a little of the us in equities and then in fixed income you could imagine with the pullback of the bond market you had a little more dislocation there and a few basis points is what tips the thing but we feel very good about the quality of those portfolios and therefore we feel like that will bounce back as well ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 so we dont feel like theres a major change and again when you look at a quarter within a year versus and years of having really strong performance i dont think that has an effect and i think particularly in institutional clients understand a little more of whats underlying the portfolio and so i think that is also very important thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi thats helpful color jim if i could just slip in one last question just on risk transfer interest rates have gone way up which presumably would help the pricing on potential risk transfer of life annuity longterm care any update you can give on either the broader potential evaluation of that and also as it relates to interest rates whether you think that would be a step in the right direction as you think about doing something down the road and also maybe a little bit on timing if this is a several quarter out likely development thanks walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so let me take a shot then maybe jim will add clearly the interest rate environment improves as you look at longterm care and other aspects of that and as it relates to risk transfer theres clearly in our opinion a more active interest in these sort of products and youre seeing that so yeah those two aspects combined to certainly have a higher profile for people looking at books of that nature these are long complicated transactions again youve seen it with many of the things that have been announced how long they have taken so i wouldnt put a timeframe on them like i said were starting off in a very good position we have great products and we just with people expressing interest we basically evaluate from that standpoint but the environment is certainly beneficial at this stage thomas gallagher q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator operator instructions we have our next question from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey guys good morning thanks for the question i was hoping to dig into a little more into the awm brokerage cash and sort of the dynamics that are likely to see here with higher interest rates so the topic of sort of cash sorting and the ability to retain customer cash is definitely top of mind for investors you guys are kind of bouncing around pretty close to historical lows in terms of percentage of client assets as cash as you think forward and presumably there will be some surge for yield as better kind of higheryielding options become available to investors how are you thinking about the ability to retain this cash is there a way to frame kind of the absolute downside in terms of percentage of client assets that could remain within the amp channel whether its the bank or the broker sweep just trying to get a sense for kind of holistic cash balances james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 so alex i think what i would say is over the years our total asset levels have gone up and so to your point our cash levels have risen in consistency with that i think what i would say if i even look at over the course of the year or from the first quarter et cetera were up a few billion dollars as we sort of usually what you have is a little more of a drawdown in the first quarter as more money goes back into work from the end of the year and stuff and what weve seen is a little more of a pickup so i would probably say to the effect if people will put some more money back into the bond market or whatever or keep a little less cash on the hold but i dont see it materially going down because we didnt really increase it as far as positional cash that much in that sense i think to your point its maintained as a percentage of total assets our advisors have been very good about the rebalancing of portfolios and keeping that money active but i would say yeah its gone up a few billion dollars from where i would probably normally think it would be at this juncture but i dont see it falling dramatically from there because to walters point its positional its transactional its keeping some emergency cash levels that we think is important from a client perspective to have alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then in terms of the different buckets i wish hoping to dig into the bank sweep channel a little bit more you guys have obviously been moving more cash into your own bank as deposits but you remain a pretty significant player in that market in the bank sweep kind of broker sweep market the demand from other banks has been pretty weak obviously for the last yearplus are you starting to see any improvement in sort of brokerage demand from other banks as liquidity potentially becomes diminishes a bit over the next few quarters are you starting to see any discussion on pricing it feels like right now its kind of fed funds flattish no spread on top of that could we start to think some of that pricing dynamic improve over the next year or so walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc its walter havent seen much change in the demand characteristics its working its way through and weve seen a little of basically discussions on price but not much alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks so much operator we have our next question from suneet kamath with jefferies suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just wanted to start on capital return youre talking about the of operating earnings but given the excess capital position remains very strong it seems like the rbc ratio is quite strong as well and given the pullback in the stock just wondering how youre thinking about buybacks and could we exceed the as we think about the balance of the year ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc i would say listen the is an area of target that we talk about and in each quarter we evaluate what we would do but right now i would say the is a good barometer we certainly have the capacity but it is i think we are not changing the barometer right now well just evaluate options as we look through james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah suneet i think its also based on what happens in the environment in the market but we have flexibility weve deployed that flexibility at the right times where we feel it made sense but i think on the other side to walters point were giving you a little bit of a targeted range that we feel at this juncture up and down will still make sense but there is opportunity for us to deploy if necessary or we want to based on opportunities suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it and then i guess on performance fees theyve been strong i guess the past two quarters and i think you had mentioned some of that is related to bmo but do you have any kind of line of sight on what youd expect from performance fees sort of in the balance of the year or is this kind of allin at this point james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i think one of the things i would say and then walter can complement so first of all weve added the bmo business which is an institutional business and it does have with some of its alternatives and real estate et cetera so if someone said will have the same performance fees you had two years ago the answer is no we should have larger number of performance fees maybe not as a percentage of the total asset base but more in total dollars because theres more product that have performance fees on them but thats lumpy and its also based upon when things get accrued or when it gets liquidated et cetera so walter i dont walter stanley berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no i think its exactly the point we have a solid base where we do generate performance fees and certainly it generates earnings we cant predict what they are certainly as you look at property or you look at private equity and in these environments it gets even a little more difficult to do that but its a solid solid business for us and we just cant give you the predictability of it but certainly were happy we have it suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc yeah got it and then maybe this last one just on the environment i think in the past when weve gone through these periods of market weakness you guys have pulled the contingency expense lever pretty aggressively it doesnt sound like youre doing that this cycle and im just curious is the difference here the upside that you expect from the bank kind of that million that you talked about is that kind of what keeps you a little bit more comfortable on the expense side versus what you guys have done in the past james michael cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 well what i would say suneet is this one is yes theres always the upside you mentioned there the other thing i would probably say is we have not if you looked at us even over the last few years when the markets been really good we have not grown our expense base normally at a much higher rate i think some other companies have and might have to really deal with that i think we havent i mean even look at columbia threadneedle outside of the increase in expenses because bmo was added their expenses were relatively flat in the quarter yearoveryear same thing were up only a few percent in advice wealth with all that growth of that business and the investments we have made so i would say that we will turn the spigot so to speak if we feel like things are weakening but i would also say that we still have good activity and therefore we want to make sure we handle that well and support the business well so i think you got to were looking at what that balance is but we havent been overly high on the expense growth but if we feel like things have really well activity has gone down and yeah well tighten those expenses suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you
