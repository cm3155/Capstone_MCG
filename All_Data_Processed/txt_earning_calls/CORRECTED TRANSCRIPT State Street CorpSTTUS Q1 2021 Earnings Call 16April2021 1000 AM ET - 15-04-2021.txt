before i review our results i would like to briefly reflect on the environment we are operating in today as compared to this time last year and then highlight some of the data that evidence the progress we are making towards enhancing and improving our operating model and innovating across our franchise all the while being an essential partner for our clients relative to the first quarter of the first three months of could hardly be more different economic activity is sharply rebounding unemployment is declining and equity markets have recovered strongly from the crisis levels experienced in although shortend rates remain at historically low levels longend us bond yields are rebounding state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 while covid19 infection and death rates remain stubbornly high in many parts of the world there is clearly light at the end of this pandemic tunnel the owners and managers of the worlds capital are also looking to the future and to the next stage of growth as the economy and financial markets continue to recover and investment inflows continue to grow we remain focused on delivering for our clients across segments and regions as demonstrated by our first quarter financial results state street continues to successfully navigate the improving operating environment although as i noted shortterm interest rates which compressed further during the first quarter remain a critical headwind for our industry while we cannot control interest rates we are resolutely focused on implementing our strategy and pivoting our business to being more of an enterprise outsource solutions provider underpinned by the ongoing development and delivery of our state street alpha fronttoback platform and we look forward with confidence for a number of reasons first we further built upon our reputation for reliability during the crisis and our clients know that they can depend on indiscernible services and market solutions they need in good times and in bad second throughout the crisis we continued to invest in further strengthening and distinguishing our global operating model client service and operational resiliency which has been apparent to and noted by our clients third many clients are reassessing their own operating models and as a result we have the opportunity to take on more of their operations and data activities allowing them to focus on creating better investment outcomes for their clients fourth our employees continue to perform at very high levels despite a year of largely remote work and disrupted routines i am grateful for their extraordinary dedication and service last both our alpha and nonalpha institutional servicing value propositions continue to resonate and enjoy take up as demonstrated by some recent announcements for example we reported an additional three state street alpha clients during the first quarter and separately this morning we announced a full fronttoback alpha relationship with invesco adding front and middleoffice services to our existing backoffice mandates through the open architecture nature of our operating platform we have been able to rapidly increase functionality through a number of partnerships unlocking new sources of revenue and strengthening the interoperability element of our alpha value proposition which is appealing to clients after quarterend we announced that mg has appointed us to provide outsourced middleoffice services in addition to our existing fund accounting and custody services state street will administer the middleoffice services on aladdin exemplifying how we offer clients the benefit of choice regarding their frontend and middle office systems these deals highlight how we are uniquely positioned to win fronttoback mandates as well as to win new business as a result of the interoperable nature of our operating platform while the alpha platform remains an integral part of our strategy we also continue to innovate across our franchise for example a growing demand exists for esg solutions that will provide the necessary data risk analytics and reporting capabilities at scale to that end during the first quarter we introduced enhancements to our esg solutions and can now provide clients with the ability to address new global esg regulatory requirements for a single platform state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 global advisors a new us corporate esg etf launched in emea in late and grew to billion of aum by the end of the first quarter making it the largest corporate bond esg fund in the ucits space we also continue to develop our digital asset strategy as we prepare to deploy our capabilities and servicing indiscernible we recently announced our intention to service the vaneck bitcoin trust etf subject to regulatory approval we will work with vaneck to provide services including etf basket operations custody of the etf shares fund accounting order taking and transfer agency in multiple jurisdictions next i will review our first quarter highlights before handing the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail turning to slide first quarter eps was or excluding notable items relative to the yearago period first quarter total revenue declined driven by the impact of interest rate headwinds on our nii results however total fee revenue increased driven by servicing and management fee growth which increased and yearoveryear respectively as well as an improved software and processing fee performance collectively these more than offset the yearoveryear headwind from fx trading as compared to the exceptionally strong first quarter of trading last year while our fx trading revenues were down yearoveryear first quarter revenue remains well above prepandemic levels as a result of higher client volumes and the investment we have made in our platforms and talent in recent years even with rising total fee revenue first quarter total expenses were essentially flat yearoveryear excluding notable items and currency translation as productivity improvements are paying off furthermore we have successfully reduced highcost location head count relative to the period one year ago as a result we remain confident in our ability to control core operating expenses over the remainder of at the end of the first quarter auca and aum both increased to record levels supported by higher period end markets auca increased to trillion new asset servicing wins were a solid billion while servicing assets remaining to be installed in future periods amounted to billion at quarterend global advisors aum increased to trillion and also benefited from a very strong flow performance in etfs and a solid performance in the cash business at crd annual recurring revenue increased to million and we remain pleased with how the business is performing while also enabling our alpha strategy overall we had a strong start to the year and we remain confident that we have a clear path for our mediumterm targets as we discussed in january to conclude we continue to successfully navigate and distinguish ourselves in a fluid and improving operating environment as demonstrated by our first quarter results we remain focused on further developing and growing our alpha offering and are pleased with the recent client activities meanwhile we also continue to innovate across and grow many areas of our franchise during the first quarter we returned million of capital to our shareholders through a combination of common share repurchases and common dividends for the second quarter of our board has authorized up to million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the fed and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 eric w aboaf chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone ill begin my review of our first quarter results on slide we reported eps of or excluding the impact of notable items which amounted to in the first quarter as detailed in the panel on the right side of the slide on the left of the slide you can see that we had yet another solid quarter of total fee revenue growth while expenses were wellcontrolled despite higher market values and client volumes as a result of the depreciating dollar relative to the yearago period we also show our first quarter results excluding the impact of currency translation in the column to the right total fee revenue was up almost yearoveryear or up excluding the impact of currency translation despite the significantly yearonyear headwind from the exceptional fx trading services results we had in the first quarter of last year due to the pandemic for context total fee revenue excluding fx trading services was up yearonyear or excluding the impact of currency translation with strong midsingledigit growth in servicing fees management fees and securities finance expenses were roughly flat yearonyear excluding notable items and the headwinds from currency translation which you can see at the bottom of the slide so in total this was a solid quarter demonstrating the progress were making in improving our operating model as we drive towards growth turning to slide youll see strong business volume growth across the franchise periodend auca increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to a record trillion the yearonyear change was driven by higher periodend market levels client flows and net new business growth quarteronquarter auca increased as a result of higher periodend equity market levels better client flows and net new business which more than offset the impact of lower bond markets were seeing that both retail and institutional investors have moved off the sidelines and were seeing inflows globally across most product types that we now ph custody at global advisors aum increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to trillion also a record the yearonyear and sequential quarter increases both primarily driven by higher periodend market levels coupled with net etf and cash inflows our etf franchise had a strong flow performance again as the us etf industry experienced record flows spdr net inflows amounted to over billion in the first quarter with both sectors and industries and low cost doing particularly well turning to slide first quarter servicing fees increased yearonyear including currency translation which was worth approximately percentage points yearonyear the increase reflects higher average market levels and normal pricing headwinds servicing fees were also up quarteronquarter as a result of the higher average market levels and stronger client activity this quarter we saw good growth in asset managers alternatives and official institutions im pleased with how has started as the first quarter auca wins totaled a solid billion which is up from recent quarters and for context last quarter you heard me outline that we need approximately billion of annual gross sales volumes in order to drive net underlying growth which means offsetting typical client attrition and normal pricing headwinds in our servicing business state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 im also pleased to report that our first quarter wins span a good mix of client segments and deal sizes with an attractive overall fee rate as we continue to work on generating broadbased growth across our clients segments and regions as an example you may have also seen that earlier in the quarter we announced that we have assumed the depository bank and fund administrative activities of a subsidiary of intesa sanpaolo in europe auca won but yet to be installed amounted to billion at quarterend positively both our reported wins and tobeinstalled numbers exclude the two recently announced mandates which ron mentioned just a moment ago as these deals were signed after the end of the first quarter turning to slide let me discuss several other important fee revenue lines in more detail first quarter management fees were million up yearonyear including a impact from currency translation but were flat quarteronquarter both our yearonyear and quarteronquarter management fee performance has benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong flow performance within our etf and cash businesses partially offset by an idiosyncratic client asset reallocation from higher fee products as well as money market fee waivers regarding money market fee waivers we had about million this quarter and we expect that they will increase given the significant downward move in shortend rates in march if they persist we expect companywide impact to be around million to million per quarter for the rest of the year beginning in net of distribution fees though higher balances should be worth roughly million to million per quarter leaving the net impact closer to million per quarter fx trading services had yet another strong quarter relative to the exceptional first quarter of fx trading revenue fell yearonyear but it was up quarteronquarter with higher volumes across both developed and emerging market currency pairs while fx market volatility declined relative to the fourth quarter we continue to see higher client volumes as our fx business continue to benefit from many years of investment across six venues and now markets three of which we added and two of which we expanded in the last year alone our securities finance business recorded its second consecutive quarter of good revenue growth increasing yearonyear and quarteronquarter mainly as a result of higher enhanced custody balances driven by new mandates from alternative clients and increase in fixed income assets on loan within our agency lending program finally our first quarter software and processing fees were up yearonyear and down quarteron quarter largely due to changes in marktomarket adjustments moving to slide we have here crds standalone revenue growth and business performance metrics we have again separated crd revenues into three categories to help see through the lumpy revenue pattern inherent in the revenue recognition accounting rules for onpremise revenue total crd revenues increased yearon year primarily as a result of higher softwareenabled revenue and was lower quarteronquarter largely due to seasonally higher onpremise revenues in the fourth quarter as shown on this slide the more durable saas and professional services revenues increased by a strong combined growth rate relative to the yearago period on the bottom right of the slide we show some of the first quarter highlights of state street alpha we reported an additional three alpha clients during the first quarter as the value proposition continues to resonate with our client base and this doesnt include this mornings first quarter and quarterend announcement the alpha pipeline continues to remain promising as the economic state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 disruption in the last year has helped clients realize the transformational potential of the alpha platform for their technology and operations infrastructure turning to slide first quarter nii declined yearonyear mainly as a result of the effects of the low interest rate environment on our investment portfolio and the absence of a million marketrelated benefits in the first quarter of quarteronquarter nii declined as expected around of the sequential quarter decline was due to the impact of lower longend rates on our investment portfolio despite a sequential improvement in premium amortization approximately percentage point of the sequential decline was due to just a half quarters downdraft in shortend rates on our sponsored member repo activity and the rest was due to the lumpier items including day count these impacts were partially offset by higher deposit balances as you can see on the right of the slide total average deposits increased by billion in the first quarter or an increase of quarteronquarter reflecting the impact of the federal reserves expansionary monetary policy we remain mindful of oci risks to our capital so as the us treasury sold off dramatically during the first quarter we gently trimmed the investment portfolio and may selectively reinvest a bit over the coming months at higher rates turning to slide weve again provided a view of the expense base this quarter exnotables so that the underlying trends are clearly evident excluding notable items first quarter expenses increased yearonyear which is all driven by the weaker dollar which means we effectively held underlying expenses flat yearonyear on a line item basis compensation employee benefits was up only excluding the impact of currency translation as higher seasonal expenses were partially offset by reduction in head count in higher cost locations information systems and communication expenses were up excluding the impact of currency translation due to higher software costs and continued investment in our technology estate transaction processing expenses were up just exfx as our savings initiatives offset significant volumebased growth in subcustody and market data costs occupancy and other expenses were both down several points relative to the fourth quarter expenses were primarily impacted by higher seasonal and deferred compensation overall im pleased with the underlying expense performance in the first quarter as we absorbed approximately million of variable revenuerelated costs we continue to demonstrate operating model improvements as we drive increased productivity through automation reengineering and scale moving to slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios as you can see we continue to navigate the improving operating environment with strong capital levels as of quarterend our standardized cet1 ratio was up slightly yearonyear but fell percentage points quarteronquarter to relative to the fourth quarter our capital base was impacted by lower aoci as a result of the significant runup in longend us treasury yields as well as by an increase in intangibles related to the recently announced liftup deal we completed with intesa sanpaolo we also saw a billion increase in episodic rwa primarily related to fx trading and overdraft activity this rwa headwind was transient in nature and has already declined by billion so at the end of the second quarter our cet1 ratio will be over all else being equal state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 tier leverage was down yearoveryear and fell by percentage point quarteronquarter to primarily as a result of higher average assets driven by the increase in quarterly average deposit balances as well as the aoci change and the million partial call for our series f preferred securities announced in january as you can see on the slide and as i mentioned previously we continue to consider a cet1 target range of to as appropriate level of capital for our business further we consider that our tier leverage ratio between and as also being appropriate for our business model and can comfortably operate in this quarter this year even with the recent growth in deposits last as we look ahead and as ron noted for the second quarter of sic our board has authorized up to million of common stock repurchases consistent with the limit set by the fed turning to slide we provide a summary of our first quarter results despite the continued headwind from historically low interest rates im pleased with our quarterly performance which demonstrates solid underlying trends within our business as well as the progress we are making within our institutional services franchise total fee revenue was up almost yearonyear including the significant yearonyear headwind from the exceptional fx trading services result we had in the first quarter of last year and excluding fx trading services total fee revenue was up yearoveryear or excluding the impact of currency translation with solid mid singledigit growth across servicing fees management fees and sec lending and with that strong top line fee growth expenses were wellcontrolled and were held roughly flat yearoveryear excluding notable items and the headwind from foreign currency translation demonstrating the progress were making in improving our operating model next i would like to update our fullyear economic outlook and provide our current thinking regarding the second quarter at a macro level our fullyear interest rate outlook assumes that shortend rates remain pressured and there is some modest steeping of the yield curve in line with the current forwards which suggests modestly improving premium amortization so the pace of improvement remains uncertain were also now assuming global equity markets will be flattish to the current levels for the rest of the year or up around pointtopoint from the beginning of as well as continued normalization of fx market volatility in terms of the second quarter of our guide includes about percentage points of currency tailwinds for fee revenue and percentage points of headwinds for expenses so we expect the overall fee revenue to be up to yearoveryear depending on equity market levels with servicing and management fees up to as we anniversary a strong in fx trading and crd regarding nii given the impact of historically low shortend rates as well as the impact of longend rates in our investment portfolio we now expect nii to run around million to million per quarter from here in assuming premium amortization continues to attenuate turning to expenses we remain laserfocused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and controlling costs we expect that second quarter expenses exnotable items will be up around yearoveryear or relatively flat excurrency translation with some potential for variability due to the revenuerelated costs state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 on taxes we expect that the tax rate will be towards the upperend of our fullyear range of to while it is still early in the year we are taking up our fullyear fee revenue guide again and now expect fullyear fee revenue to be up to we also expect that slightly higher revenuerelated variable costs will add about basis points to our prior full year expense guide of flat to down exnotable items just remember theres a solid point of fx translation in these and fullyear fee and fullyear expense guides and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric and operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great good morning ron and eric thanks for taking the question so maybe we could start with servicing fees i was hoping first is we could unpack sort of q1 dynamics a bit more so excurrency translation servicing fees were up about sequentially maybe you can just kind of walk us through how much was the market versus sort of and higher volumes versus more kind of organic trends in the quarter and then taking a step back it really sounds like momentum in fronttoback is progressing pretty nicely so i was hoping you could bridge these data points you highlighted on the call sort of back to the servicing fee algorithm that eric you talked about in the past kind of between markets pricing new business i think collectively that added up to like maybe a lowsingledigit growth over time kind of how does that feel to you guys now given some of the changes youve seen in the business eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp alex its eric let me start on the quarter and then well talk a little more about the momentum in the business i think we felt like we had a solid quarter here as you saw servicing fees were up yearoveryear in aggregate i mentioned about percentage points of that which is currency translation so the underlying growth was around if we were to decompose the and you know theres always a mix of items here the largest positive driver was equity market appreciation so equity market appreciation across the lowequity markets were up north of on average that translated to about a tailwind in servicing fees for the quarter and then against that we had the normalized amount of the normal amount of fee headwinds of about which brought us down to the net so it was a good quarter i think what we continue to focus on is there tends to be some tailwind in our model from flows and client activity this quarter we had some of that but we also had it a year ago in a good amount state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 so that was relatively neutral on a yearonyear basis and then the other component is net new business and as ive said i think pretty clearly we have had lighter sales quarters in the over the last four to six quarters we need to take that up and as that happens well be in a position to have net new business growth for the time being net new business is relatively neutral which is okay but not enough and not at the levels that wed like to be and thats i think partly why we have been real clear around the amount of net new business we need to win weve been actioning that on a segment basis a regional basis youve heard about our coverage model expansion all those are components of that acceleration which i think are wellalong and starting to show some positive results as i highlighted in asset managers for example and in alternatives and that i think will be to our advantage in the coming time periods ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp alex why dont i just add to that the second part of your question how does i think what youre basically asking is how does alpha fit in all this and how does it change those numbers clearly the were pleased with the progress with alpha three reported wins in the first quarter and as we noted one that we reported already for the second quarter about a third of our business tobeinstalled the billion tobeinstalled is alpha related and we would expect that to grow just given some of the things that weve talked about what that means though is these are longer installations right were remember in effect were becoming the enterprise outsourcer to these clients so it will be nice revenue impact but were talking about and revenue impact relatively little of that certainly the things that we reported for the first quarter will we see in alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it understood and then maybe a quick one on capital obviously ratios came down sequentially for the reasons that you described not particularly surprising i guess maybe talk to us a little bit about the willingness to dip below tier leverage if the balance sheet remains elevated or maybe even grows from here for one reason or another and if you guys are willing to sort of continue to execute on your capital return plan how much flexibility do you have going below the lowend i guess of your target and staying there eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah alex its a good question were on the capital return plan thats largely driven by our common equity tier ratios which had some volatility this quarter but are still solidly above i think or will return solidly above where we the range so weve got confidence in what we can do there on tier leverage therere probably a couple of different aspects of that matter i think first wed like to operate in this quarter of to and we have some a little more room in the balance sheet to if we get pushed on deposits but as you remember we also have some ability to adjust that if you recall we added some discretionary deposits over the last twoyear time period and those are in the billion billion billion range so theres some tactical ways we can accommodate clients and then continue to manage the size of the overall balance sheet i think we certainly have an ability occasionally to move outside and below the range on the if were the rightway around and right now its rightway risk so to speak because its clients rather is coming to state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 us because of the strength of our brand thats pushing that ratio and so we can always do that for a quarter or two if necessary and so part of what were very mindful of is how do we continue to support our clients during this time of fed easing and so therere ways to navigate through that in during the year and we kind of see that as just part of our normal business activity alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc understood thanks very much eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks very much so theres some good things going on in the quarter but i think the roe and the pretax margin are still pretty far below targets i think the margin one is in over time given the headwinds on rates and fee waivers that you just described but on the roe side do you view that as simply a function of capital built in getting down to your closer to your targets because it felt like better than an roe quarter the momentum in the business feels better than that but thats a low roe considering all the growth that you built so just curious on how you think about that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp glenn let me start a couple of things just to keep in mind first the first quarter every year is always our low point on margin and roe because of the seasonal deferred incentive compensation expenses so those come through and then weve got to take a full year look so id just be a little cautious on that i think more broadly in terms of roe its absolutely a focus i think youve seen in our proxy over the last few years roe as a management has a management target we added margin to that and now fee revenue so were incredibly focused on those three major leverage points and ive got to tell you ive got the entire management team whos thinking about those every month and every quarter i think the way i think about roe is probably from a couple of perspectives in terms of its trajectory i think first continued work on margin and this year were just trying to hold margins steady notwithstanding given the falling interest rates but youve seen us actually hold expenses flat and fee revenues up that is going to over time expand margin and then and filter back into roe and every points of expansion in margin is point of roe so theres real i think flowthrough there and then i think the second one is you hinted is around capital return were very pleased to return of earnings this year in line with this year this quarter in the first quarter in line with the fed limits weve done that again in the second quarter and were committed to a pattern of capital return as a way to return capital to investors and to drive up roe and so i think theres a path in that way as well state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that maybe one quick followup on the fee waivers i heard your comments on million growing to million and million net just as a sequential number thats a big stepup and i know how it works generically but id love to hear how you think about like was a yield wire obviously tripped so to speak in the quarter and then more importantly how much and which part of the curve need to or which reference points need to go up over what level to get us back to a more breathable level because million to million is a big step thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah glenn its eric i think the good news here is while we have some fee money market fee waivers we dont have the size of money market fee waivers that others are seeing around the industry just because of the more institutional nature of our money market complex so i take some i think thats some context to help with the money market fee waivers are effectively driven by shortend rates it could be everything from overnight repo to onemonth and threemonth treasuries and effectively as one and threemonth treasuries fell from kind of basis points down to and basis points in march youre starting to get to the point where the reinvestment rate against the management fee rate starts to be inflected and as a result we are at that pressure point and literally the or 5basispoint move at the frontend does have the impact as youve seen i think the good news here as weve continue to see cash inflows into our complex part of that comes from the easing and the monetary policy that were seeing part of that is i think we have an attractive set of offerings and ill tell you that thats all been factored into our guide and part of what were managing through glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thanks a lot eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks just maybe one more on rates maybe focus on the net interest revenue outlook the million to million on a quarterly basis what given the view of both the forward curve and premium amortization likely easing down over the course of the year even if short rates are sort of stable where they are now what would prohibit that million from improving in the second half is there a mix shift assumption within the next i would have thought it would improve as we get to the later part of the year eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 brian its a good question the way i think the best way to understand it is the short rates had an impact in the first quarter and then well now have three months worth of that in the second quarter so thats what drives the additional nudge down from what we would have preferred to have seen on longend rates longend rates have been a headwind all through last year as they came down and now even at this current level are a headwind for the portfolio they were a headwind in the portfolio for example from to by about points of nii what has started to work against the longend rate impact is premium amortization which has started to come down and that was actually a tailwind sequentially of about points of nii and so youre kind of having this continued headwind from longend rates which will which just has to play through remember the average duration of the portfolio is in is about three years think about when long rates were when the rate cycle started was a year ago so theres another year of longend rates being a headwind what were now looking for is the premium amortization to slow down now we need to be careful about the pace of that slowing down but that is expected to slow based on the various models and that starts to create a partial offset to those longend rate headwinds and what were looking for is the crossover point and we think sometime in the second half of this year longend rates will still be a headwind but premium amortization should begin to offset that and thus the collection of those two will be roughly neutral and thats effectively why we dont see an uptick because that longend rate headwind just continues on effectively for that two to threeyear time period that has to flow through the books and what we need to see over time is for premium amortization to fall substantially enough so that there is some uplift we just dont see that happening this year and i think the question is how and when that begins to turn and what im trying to do is avoid getting out ahead of us because we just need to see it play out and i think well know more in the coming couple of quarters brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thats really in a sense good color and then on the invesco win so just to maybe talk about the calibration of revenue and expense you typically when you have these installments theres a little bit of expense ahead of time before the revenue comes in maybe if you could just characterize if thats the case or do you actually are you actually able to build revenue sort of immediately after its installed to offset that and then i think you were doing the correct me if im wrong but i think you were doing most of the custody fund accounting for invesco so this optically would be an addon in revenue but your custody base wouldnt change so much so therefore it would be it would appear to be a price improvement given its youre getting more revenue from the same customer maybe if you could just talk about that a little bit eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian let me just step back a little bit because were not and weve never really talked about individual clients individual client wins and then how we onboard the revenues the expenses youre getting at a level of i think specificity thats not something we typically go into and we dont because we want to be respectful of our clients respectful of various positions i think what i would tell you is and youve seen us with other wins describe them we often say that theres a range of products that come over from a client as part of a win some come more quickly and some take more state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 time and i think ive been on record saying custody tends to come more quickly often but not always accounting middleoffice charles river takes time and the larger the installations the more time it takes and you are right that says that in your view that some of those expenses we built a bit in advanced because weve got onboard weve got to do some of the professional development and technology connectivity for that so anyway i think you have the right outline and i think what were going to do in general is help everyone understand the momentum of our business part of the reason i give the quarterly guidance is to give you a little bit of insight to what we expect and thats all of our client activity all of our wins our tobeinstalled business factors in brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay fair enough thank you operator your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc ron i had a question just around how youre thinking about strategy in ssga i mean theres been some headlines around the fact that perception that youve been looking at opportunities over in europe and wanted to understand how important it is for you to gain share in europe and maybe you could broaden out the answer of course to just generally the strategy in ssga could you give us a sense as to what youre looking to do and capability adds that youre trying to accomplish ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah so i mean ill start by just reminding everybody that asset management is a very important business for us its smaller than investment servicing but we have quite a good business there and as weve said oftentimes were constantly looking at our strategy were looking we always look at first at organic opportunities to grow and second inorganic opportunities to grow and weve done a little bit of inorganic but most of what you see in terms of the progress there has been a result of organic activities including some of the as i noted in my remarks some of the recent growth in europe i mean im not going to comment on market rumors we feel very good about the position we have and dont feel that we have to do something at any point but we also are looking for opportunities to exploit the position we have and to see if theres opportunities to grow it but it will for us be primarily driven by organic activities and secondarily if theres something inorganic that makes sense strategically and makes sense to the shareholders then well look at that state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just separately and maybe there is if theres any capability sets there that youre looking to expand into that would be helpful to understand but just on the eye in the servicing side weve also seen some announcements on servicing bitcoin etfs and maybe you could give us a sense as to how long you anticipate it takes to bring that to market and is there anything else youre doing on the crypto side or digital currency side in particular are you going to be looking to service physicals or do you expect to use others to service physicals and subcustodians just your strategy there would be helpful to understand thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah ill start and eric will probably want to add to this listen theres a lot of activity in this space and crypto means a lot it means different things to different people weve been active in certainly digital ledger and blockchain technology for a long time now we do see this as a growing segment of the marketplace weve got a number of initiatives in place to figure out how we can establish a leadership position there theres i think its fair to say that theres the regulatory environment has some catching up to do here and thats clearly on the minds of regulators and theres clearly lots of applications in front of them but right now thats part of the gating factor but we would view this as a trend thats here to stay and i think its a combination of how do you think about cryptocurrencies and servicing cryptocurrencies in the fullest form not just traditional currency but administration how do you think about in the context of an etf what does crypto basket creation look like but then theres the other side of this its crypto assets and were very active in thinking about how do we move from custodying something thats physical or near physical to custodying a token and what does that mean for us so its a very very important part of our rd and its a very very important part of our indiscernible eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah betsy id just add that as ron described theres a whole across the whole value chain right there are ways for us to participate in crypto and youve seen us do that announced a number of partnerships minority investments and so forth i think were also very conscious of where is the whitespace where are there nearterm opportunities and we think etf crypto etf is an important one why because it takes something that is a bit on the side a little bit more retail and makes it mainstream it makes it mainstream for retail and for institutions it increases access and so were very active and you saw one announcement weve got a strong pipeline of clients because these are by and large our clients who are innovating in crypto etf and while many of those need to go through a regulatory approval stage they all need recordkeepers and administrators right the core of this is the credibility that we could bring and we think thats a real area of whitespace where we can lean in and both support our clients and also be a real important participant and player in one of the emerging spaces betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and when do you expect the capability will be up and running eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp the well therere different capabilities right theres everything from custody of the tokens itself we often partner to do that and we had subcustody relationships just like we have subcustody relationships in core state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 assets recordkeeping and administration is something that we have the capability today to do which is why weve been appointed by several etf providers who are in various stages of the regulatory approval process and id say thats not just appointed here in the us but we have pipeline and appointments in around the world germany is a very advanced market in this space canada australia and so but that recordkeeping and administration capability we have today and are ready to roll that out in support of our clients betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator your next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks eric a followup a couple of followup questions on the balance sheet noticing that the investment portfolio was smaller on both periodend and average but you had a good amount of deposit growth so it seems like you actually have more cash sitting around today is that how do you contemplate that going forward and are any changes in terms of how you reinvest built into your nii outlook eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yes ken good question we always have to be mindful of the balance between nii growth driven by the investment portfolio and the amount of aoci risk that we take especially now that were in place where rates are likely to either stay flat or rise and the question is are we going to get a rate shock or not so we just need to be careful of that we took a little bit of duration off the table in the first quarter as rates rose remember naturally our mbs duration will lengthen and so that was one of the reasons we shortened up is just to protect against that and i think the team that we had did quite a nice job of doing that early in the quarter and protected some of what we wanted to around aoci here it does put us in a position where we have some cash that we can put to work in the coming quarters that is included in our in the outlook that i gave and itll provide a partial offset to the longend rate downdraft that we continue to see but we are also at the point where the investment portfolio was resized relative to a year ago by a solid larger we did that but it does need to have a theres a certain capacity that we can run and its in the right range though we may we will had a little bit adjust a little bit trade around the edges to make the most with what we have ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and to that point you did mention the episodic increase in rwa im just wondering if you can help us understand how much of a weight was that on the cet1 and i think you mentioned getting back above the target range so just does that come back and just wondering if this how much of an anomaly were the ratios this quarter outside of what we saw in oci state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah the episodic items that i mentioned two of them are worth about point of cet1 so all else being equal we printed we would have printed if they hadnt flowed through and i mentioned those because in fact thats why we have buffers thats why we have ranges thats kind of part of what we need to operate around and always flag if they come in a little heftier which might occasionally push ratios down a bit or lighter which sometimes happens as well which will push ratios up and thats fine these are just pretty typical overdrafts occasionally spike up and you spike up overdrafts billion to billion on the base of our balance it adds point of the cet1 impact and then the other one is the fx book just by nature of it having a sort of derivative positions when the dollar is in the money strongly we end up because the book is hedged we have liabilities and assets in that book we in this case as the dollar strengthened we ran positive marktomarket but that has a that gets weighted heavily by the rwa standardized rules and so you kind of had a billion a billion to billion rwa move which actually literally has remediated back over the last two weeks as the dollar moved the other in the other direction so anyway just part of running the business and well always have some of this volatility but at this time it costs us about point on cet1 and we its reversed since ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just curious on the servicing the outlook it seems as though theres some i know that this is an imperfect way to model but its the only way we got it seems as though theres a decent amount of fee rate compression or the relationship of auc and aum to revenues seems to be with revenues lagging given the outlook here and when we look at the full year it almost suggests as though thatll remain intact for the rest of the year is there anything specific going on does your outlook assume a normalization in the volumedriven components of the servicing fee piece that could be a bit of a headwind to that rate or is there some mix going on with that if theres any additional color you can give there thatd be really helpful state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure brennan i think the biggest thing thats happening right now is that as aucas rise very significant due to equity markets and actually are offset a little bit by lower bond markets that we have that anomalous fee rate impact just because its not a point for point change remember every points of change in auca effectively drives a if its driven by equity markets a 3point increase in servicing fees right its that different which means the fee rate just naturally and it just mathematically comes in lower its not like the asset management business where it tends to almost be percentage linear where and played through between auca and servicing fees so i think thats the biggest item that plays through if we look at first quarter to first quarter the yearonyears and youll see that for the rest of the year so id just be very careful about that just mathematical result i think if you step back and open up the lens on servicing fees and i think you saw we had a good result this quarter sort of seeing fees up yearoveryear nominally adjusted for currency translation i guided in second quarter that servicing fees again would be in that to range therell be a few points of currency translation in that again but thats still a very healthy growth rate a lot of that most of that is driven by the equity market appreciation offset by some of the bond markets and thats part of our business model thats always part of our business model and when equity markets are going south its part and when theyre going up its part so thats the large driver right now of the revenue growth and we think that at these levels of equity markets that were at weve got a strong set of yearonyear comparisons that we expect for second quarter and then you can we can model out for the year brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay thanks for that color and then when we think about the theres one thing thats kind of a little bit of a struggle to me because i know we talked a lot about nii and the outlook but im going to beat this dead horse a bit there was the update that was just sort of late in the quarter in march that seemed to suggest that things were going a little better and maybe we were getting to an inflection on nii and then the guide here more suggests that theres plenty to offset those green shoots so what changed in the either the portfolio or in the market that would cause the delta in between the intra quarter update and here because it libor is clearly a problem right short rates are indiscernible and it seems like thats whats holding back some of the more constructive dynamics were seeing at the longend of the curve but it seemed like we knew that when we heard the update so was there something that happened behind the scenes that maybe we werent aware of that could have had the outlook maybe take a little off of the outlook or make it a little bit less constructive eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brennan good question i appreciate your being candid and direct i think two things happened exogenously that mattered since the beginning of march when we stirred up the numbers and now first is weve seen these short rates persist at a much lower level and so i think when we were here early march where were going to have onemonth and threemonth treasuries sit at basis points for the rest of the quarter rest of the year or were they going to bounce back and theyve clearly sat here or been weighted down so i think that cost us about in first quarter and relative to where we would have been cost us effectively another in which means kind state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 of cumulatively in in in so thats not a i think thats not a welcome development now if they bounce back well have some upside but thats real and then the other one that were i think all just careful about is the attenuation of the mbs premium amortization and i think youve seen a number of commentators talk about that around the industry the last print that we all saw from fannie freddie had a small acceleration of prepayment rates instead of a downtick and i think most of that was modeled in by folks but its hopefully the last gasp on prepayment as rates have boomed up and now were in burnout mode but i think that slight one month that im fairly confident will be one month itll be a and its industrywide its in the fannie freddie data i think its just a reminder that we dont arent sure of the pace of the attenuation of the premium amortization in these mbs books that we all run we just have to be careful obviously if the burnout goes faster and premium amortization falls more quickly let me tell you ill be the first to signal that because i like you and many others are looking for not only the stabilization and were confident in the stabilization now but id love to see better than stabilization were just not quite at that point yet brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thanks appreciate the color operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ron good morning eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric can you share with us obviously prepandemic state streets balance sheet deposits roughly averaged about billion and now theyre sitting around billion in the current first quarter and during this time the fed of course increased its balance sheet dramatically from about trillion to over trillion theyre going to continue with qe as we all know at least through the end of the year into next year at billion a month in securities purchases can you share with us how are you guys calibrating what kind of deposit growth youre likely to see as the fed continues with qe for the remainder of this year and into next year eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp gerard its eric i think thats the sixtyfourthousanddollar question that many banks are wrestling with especially as some of the rule changes happened for others on slr and as we think about leverage ratios and clearly were in a new world we had seen post the global financial crisis the expansion of the fed balance sheet and then its recompression and now were in a new era again state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 i think our general view is that the pots of the banking system will roughly track the fed monetary policy expansion but itll do so in waves and i think we saw that in first and second quarter of last year we saw quite an expansion and then we saw some flatness in deposit balances and then as the fed buying offset by some of the compression in the treasurys own portfolio we saw some further uptick and weve seen that again this year i think we do expect continued expansion because we expect continued expansion of the fed balance sheet we do expect that to come back to banks and i think from our standpoint what were trying to do is be open for business for our clients and wed like to do that every day of the week because thats important to them and weve got some capacity to accommodate some of this growth as it comes its not infinite capacity but weve got some capacity and then what well have to do is if the fed balance sheet goes up another we have to see when they are going to start to constrain their own bondbuying activities slows down pause et cetera we will at the right time have to just work on some of our discretionary pools of deposits we have those and we have some capacity to adjust weve got a suite of options for clients we our deposit rates are at zero or near zero so for clients we can certainly facilitate other activities at the right point thats not for today or tomorrow or next quarter necessarily its but its in a year or two that comes right we can help them sweep to money market funds we can help them sweep to with treasury securities we can help them sweep into the repo business and so well have to just navigate through we feel pretty comfortable where we are today in the next quarter or two but well just have to see if theres a way well address and i think well just have to navigate through gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and just as a quick followup to that have you guys disclosed what percentage of your deposits are operational for your customers versus excess where you would have that flexibility to move those deposits maybe elsewhere eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp gerard there is some good disclosure in some of the post quarterend lcr type information that we and all the banks share and we can i think i can ask the ir team to point your analyst to that it gives different types of deposits and it gives different kind of those different liquidity values which starts to get at some of what youre describing around operational versus nonoperational so we can follow up with you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then as a followup question you guys are not big lenders i understand that your loan portfolio relative to your total assets is or deposits is obviously quite low but i did notice that the average loans in the quarter were down but periodend quartertoquarter were up i think any color on what drove that increase at the end of the quarter in loans eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah were always getting a little bit of volatility i think one of the well one of the things that we have is just overdrafts are coming through as a loan right as part of the book so thats one and i mentioned how that had a spike up at the end of the quarter the other one is theres a a good part of our loan book is the private equity firm capital call financing that we do and thats had a nice trajectory earlier in the quarter you just have a bit of a seasonal effect then late in the quarter weve as weve seen these funds start putting more and more capital to state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 work weve started to have draws on those loans and those have started to be those draws have added to the balances in a nice way and thats one of the reasons why we have we see some good continued growth in lending for us gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator and your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i had a big picture question and specific question i guess lets just go with the big picture first originally you were talking about converting ssga to charles river and that would be a flagship client that you could use to sell to other asset managers is that still something thats contemplated as proceeding do you have a timeframe for that how is that looking ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah mike thats underway and its proceeding exactly the way i would describe it its a big complex project so its been a good one to i mean it was client number one weve obviously got a lot of other clients since then some of them much simpler and less complex but yes its very much underway mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp and on track mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just more generally as it relates to you said new business is neutral and is that just the environment because of the pandemic its tougher to knock on doors or is that execution that youd like to see improve now you have talked about the coverage model expansion and i guess there is a it takes time to get that but when you talk internally do you say well its the pandemic its been tough to get new customers or do you say no you have to do better were raising the bar were raising the intensity ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 yeah mike weve been very open on this with you over the last few quarters its the latter much of the natural growth in this industry is not there any longer right if you go back years ago or more than that much of the growth would be existing clients doing opening new funds opening new fund ranges in different parts of the world a lot of that is already accomplished and in many cases youre seeing fund closures right as every distributor is narrowing their range and theres a desire for less choice not more choice so it absolutely is about increasing intensity and were starting to see that pay off we can talk a lot about alpha but the way to think about this is alpha and fronttoback is an and not an or right we still have an existing core business in which we see opportunity to increase penetration increase penetration in mediumsized asset managers to continue to grow what were doing with asset owners and insurance companies so its very much about the latter with the alpha particularly as we continue to land new assignments and install those as being able to provide yet a little bit more growth over the medium to long term mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then lastly i guess are you nearing the bottom to for the nii and the fee waivers i guess nii so your guidance is just a little bit lower than it was in the first quarter right its not falling off the cliff from unless im reading something wrong and the fee waivers net million worse ahead just if you could just clarify one more time on the nii and fee waivers and when do you think we hit bottom eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp mike its eric on nii i think the second quarter is the bottom and thats why ive said likely to be at million to million per quarter for the rest of the year so i think weve were at the stabilization level plus or minus a few bucks in that in and around that range and given what we know today so we think that were there were confident were there and now the question is how long is it flattish at that level and then when does it pick up in that i think well know more in the coming quarters and on the fee waivers what weve done is forecasted what theyd be for second quarter the net millionish or so offset by balances versus the net million or so from first quarter but thats predicated on short rates being where they are today and theyve been kind of flattish for the last days and but thats the assumption were obviously hoping short rates stay flat or actually move up as opposed to go the other way and so its just based on that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator your next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research your line is open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 good morning guys on the call in january you talked about addressing sales to midsized asset managers and so can you talk about some of the key differences and maybe challenges between selling to a large asset manager and selling to a midsized one and then appreciate that its pretty early in that but any update on your progress in that part of the market would be helpful too ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp rob a couple of things on this part of the sale to a mediumsized asset manager is a whole lot more standardization and its not to say that they dont need customization but were much of our success over the years was built around servicing very large asset managers so much of what weve been doing has as much to do with standardizing the product as it does around adding to sales and coverage capabilities but at the same time weve recognized that how you sell and service to them including having a way to scale up service in such a way that theyre receiving the appropriate amount of service but at a cost to serve that works for us and again that has required us to in effect establish a parallel model here and to make sure that were delivering expected service but doing it in a way that can be done at the right unit cost for us so and that work is underway this is not a i mean weve talked to you about this its not a new problem and at the same time what we also want to be able to do is theres many firms at that medium level that either through their sophistication through their range of products actually do need and can tolerate pricingwise a bit of a higher service model so a lot of this is about really understanding and segmenting the client base and getting our clients into the right bucket if you will and making sure that they truly are satisfied based on what their needs that theyre not underserved and theyre not overserved robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research thanks thats really helpful and then earlier this year too you announced an expansion of business in latin america and i was wondering if you could talk more about the opportunity there and the potential for international expansion latam and otherwise to be a source of growth going forward ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp well historically weve seen a lot of our growth come from outside the us very relatively little of it though from latin america i mean part of it has been we havent had as much coverage there as weve had elsewhere we actually have a small but very loyal client base there weve put a few people this is not a massive investment on our part but weve put a few very skilled veteran people covering that market now and were already seeing some really attractive green shoots so we see this as a medium to longterm opportunity activity is already happening even though were less than a year into this intensified effort and so we see it as a nice supplement to what we already have in place in emea and apac robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research okay thanks ron operator your next question comes from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you hi ron and eric a couple of questions for you folks asset management fees which were down about linked quarter exfx translation you mentioned that it was due to client asset reallocation what was that and was it a onetime thing or and how much of an impact did that have ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah vivek its i would describe it as idiosyncratic is maybe the best way to describe it it was an extremely large client a corporate pension fund and was doing what a lot of corporate pension funds are doing these days right derisking so move from quite high up on the fee schedule to a much more of a derisked environment as a result of their asset allocation i mean thats a trend that weve been seeing thats not new but the fact that it happened to such a very large client that was in a very big risk on asset allocation before then made it show up in our results the way it has vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah eric one for you just a followon to an earlier question on nii given that youve seen a lot of growth in your liquid assets and your securities on an average basis were flattish linked quarter what level of rates do you want to see before youre willing to move some of this liquidity into higheryielding securities or is there something else that would drive you to do that eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp there really vivek its eric there really are two probably two or three triggers or break points for us i think one is the outright level of rates in weve seen some good movement in weve not seen that much movement in and so the question is a little bit when does the curve more broadly move because we while wed like to put more money at work we need to be a little careful of our duration because with duration comes aoci volatility and so its actually a mix of a higher curve in the belly of the curve that would be good to see and right now are in the whatever 90basispoint range itd be nice to see them a good bit higher and for to pay off either in clean duration treasuries or in mbs we need higher rates a good bit higher before where were on to make that trade at the right levels of higher rates you get the benefit if rates were to come down weve a positive aoci so thats helpful but were not at that level where we everything greats are going to come back down very quickly and so we actually need more of an upswing before we really lean into the trade it doesnt mean we wont trade around the edges and trade the slope and so forth but thats probably a little bit of framing that might help vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc one quick one just you had legal and other costs of million but i noticed million of it was in transaction processing and info systems can you give a little color on what was involved there state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah vivek this was a legacy matter that dates a number of years ago there were some costs that we at the time thought were reimbursable that were by either clients or other partners that we had they did accumulate on the balance sheet and we came to the conclusion recently that theyre not reimbursable and so effectively they need to be expensed and so we cleaned up the books here but it dates back a number of years and we made the adjustment accordingly vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp okay and then i dont know if ken is still on operator but just to clarify i misspoke a little bit on his rwa question rwa was up as i said for in an episodic way about billion or billion this quarter had it not been up our cet1 ratio would have been in the to range operator your next question comes from rajiv bhatia with morningstar your line is open rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research hey good morning just a quick question for charles river can you comment on your competitive environment and retention trends and how much of your new wins is from competitive takeaway versus firms deciding to outsource ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah i mean in terms of the competitiveness of the product i mean its competitive i mean its you can look at it through its both its penetration you can look at it when you lay it alongside our other competitors just in terms of the rd in and the software development weve put into it in terms of the new business rajiv it tends to be a mix and in many cases its replacing either proprietary omss or risk analytics systems or systems that were put in that really arent being supported anymore that tends to be most of it and i think that tends to be most of it for our big competitors theres a little bit of takeaway going on typically when somebody is doing some consolidating but its not so much takeaway as it is replacing something proprietary or something thats just no longer being supported which is by the way what makes the market attractive eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp theres just inherent growth in the market as opposed to duking it out with existing strong competitors rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research got it so like your doubledigit growth outlook that doesnt necessarily much like competitive displacement ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp no rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research all right thats it for me operator your next question comes from brian kleinhanzl with kbw your line is open brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks just two quick questions for eric kind of around the guidance more clarification questions here on that fullyear fee revenue guidance that you gave was that inclusive or exclusive of the money market fee waivers eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp that was inclusive so its allin guidance it covers all the ins and outs of the business including the update on money market fees brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then also on the guidance and full year were you giving that as of where the equity markets were as of quarterend or as of today obviously big move in the markets quartertodate thus far eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp i think ill split the difference on that its the market has moved so much where were trying to give some directional guidance i think the for equity markets were still assuming the pointtopoint increase in the period last year and in the period this year of percentage points well see if that stays or not given where we are and we wrote this over the last week so were also assuming equity markets stay around where they are now which would line up with that endpoint as well brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 16apr2021 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure operator there are no further questions at this time i will now turn it back to mr ohanley for closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thank you operator and thanks to all
