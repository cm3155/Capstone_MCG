financial paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thanks kristie and good morning everyone thank you for joining us today fiscal year brought some incredible challenges what a year in many ways im glad to get it behind us first we had the unfolding of the covid19 pandemic everyone started working from home almost overnight we experienced social unrest in our country uncertain economic outlook a presidential and congressional election and a reduction in force which is extremely rare at raymond james on the other hand while this year was one of my more difficult years in my career in many ways it was also more rewarding because of the way our associates and advisors came together to respond to the crisis really reinforced our unique culture at raymond james we kept true to our guiding principles our core value of conservatism looking long term and focusing on serving our clients that resulted in great growth even during this period of time and recruiting was very strong that new assets great retention all resulted in record client assets under administration so i want to take this opportunity to say thank you thank you to all of our associates and advisors for their tremendous contributions and their unwavering commitment to serving their clients now let me turn to the financials starting on slide in the fiscal fourth quarter the firm reported net revenues of billion net income of million and earnings per diluted share of excluding expenses of million associated with the reduction of workforce and a million loss associated with the pending disposition of certain noncore operations in france adjusted quarterly net income was million and adjusted earnings per diluted share was return on equity was and adjusted return on tangible common equity was quarterly net revenues grew over the prioryear period and over the preceding quarter primarily driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees strong fixed income brokerage revenues and record investment banking revenues which were partially offset by the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates quarterly expenses were higher due mainly to compensation expense associated with higher compensation compensable revenues and reduction in workforce expense incurred during the quarter while the loan loss provision was higher on a yearoveryear basis it declined significantly from the preceding two quarters as the economy and economic conditions tended to stabilize and credit quality of the loan portfolio remained resilient but given the high degree of market uncertainty we still wanted to be prudent and adding to our reserves looking at the fiscal year results on slide we generated record net revenues of nearly billion but lower shortterm interest rates and higher loan loss reserves caused the net income to decline to million on an raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 adjusted basis net income was million sic million down compared to the adjusted net income in fiscal record revenues grew over the prior year as the continued growth of client asset along with record fixed income brokerage and investment banking revenues offset the negative impact of lower interest rates we generated record revenues in the private client group capital markets and asset management segments during the fiscal year reinforcing the value of having diverse and complementary businesses moving on to slide we ended the quarter and fiscal year with period in records for total client assets under administration of billion private client group assets in feebased accounts of billion and financial assets under management of billion the strong client asset growth was predominantly driven by equity market appreciation and our continued success in recruiting and retaining financial advisors across all of our affiliation options during the fiscal year we had a net increase of financial advisors to end with a record number of a solid result particularly given delays in recruiting and onboarding of advisors during the onset of the covid19 crisis during the fiscal year financial advisors would go for million of trailing production at approximately billion of assets under prior firms affiliated with raymond james domestically that includes recruiting results during the fourth quarter of million of trailing production and billion of assets under prior firms which was by far our best quarter for recruiting during the fiscal year as for our net organic growth results in the private client group during the year we generated domestic pcg net new assets of billion representing of domestic pcg client asset at the beginning of the year based on what weve seen we believe this to be amongst the very best in our industry even including the ebrokers who benefited from the surge of day and online trading during the year looking forward we are continuing to experience strong recruiting activity across all of our affiliation options as we are in fiscal year at the quarterend net bank loans were billion as growth of loans in the pcg clients was offset by a decline in corporate loans moving to the segment results on slide the private client group generated quarterly net revenues of billion and pretax income of million quarterly net revenues grew by over the preceding quarter predominantly driven by higher asset management and related administrative fees reflecting higher assets in fee based accounts which will continue to be a tailwind for the first quarter of fiscal this strong revenue growth helped pcgs pretax income grow sequentially although it was down on a yearoveryear basis primarily due to the negative impact of lower shortterm interest rates the capital markets segment generated record quarterly net revenues of million and record pretax income of million a truly amazing quarter for capital markets driven by broadbased strength across fixed income global equity and investment banking as well as the raymond james tax credit funds during the quarter fixed income brokerage revenues continued to benefit from a high level of client activity particularly with small and midsized depositary clients record investment banking revenues were driven by the strength in equity underwriting ma and debt underwriting the asset management segment generated quarterly net revenues of million and record pretax income of million record quarterly pretax income was driven by the growth of financial assets under management as equity market appreciation and net inflows into the pcg feebased accounts more than offset the net outflows for carillon tower associates raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 lastly raymond james bank generated quarterly net revenues of million and pretax income of million compared to the yearago quarter net revenues declined primarily due to lower net interest income as lower shortterm interest rates caused net interest margin to decline basis points compared to a yearago period the quarterly loan loss provision of million increased the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of loans to on slide you can see the fiscal year results for all of our segments the firms record revenues were driven by record revenues in the private client group capital markets and asset management segment a reflection of our attractive organic growth and consistent market share gains across businesses additionally the capital markets segment management segment generated record annual net pretax income as both segments generate significant operating leverage during the year meanwhile the pretax income declined in both private client group and raymond james bank segments due to lower shortterm interest rates and higher loan loss provisions of the bank and now for a more detailed review of the financial results ill turn the call over to paul shoukry paul paul shoukry chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thank you paul ill begin with consolidated revenues on slide record quarterly net revenues of billion grew yearoveryear and sequentially asset management fees grew on a yearoveryear basis and sequentially commensurate with the sequential increase in feebased assets private client group assets and feebased accounts were up during the fiscal fourth quarter which will provide a tailwind for this line item for the first quarter of fiscal consolidated brokerage revenues of million grew over the prior year the continued strength and fixed income trading helped fuel this growth for the year consolidated brokerage revenues were up to almost billion lifted by strong institutional fixed income brokerage revenues of million which were up over fiscal while the fixed income business is continuing to benefit from high client activity levels these revenues are inherently difficult to predict so i think a reasonable assumption for fiscal is that these brokerage revenues may end up somewhere between the results in fiscal year and the record achieved in fiscal year but again it is highly uncertain and will largely be driven by market conditions throughout the year account and service fees of million declined yearoveryear primarily due to the decrease in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks due to lower shortterm interest rates which ill discuss along with net interest income in more detail on the next two slides consolidated investment banking revenues of million grew yearoveryear achieving a record result driven by strong equity underwriting debt underwriting and ma advisory revenues for the fiscal year we generated record investment banking revenues of million which were up over the prior years record really amazing results given the high degree of market uncertainty during the year while our investment banking pipelines are robust closings will largely be dependent on conducive markets which we cant necessarily count on given we are still in the middle of a global pandemic raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 turning to other revenue which was million for the quarter this line included million of private equity valuation gains of which approximately million were attributable to noncontrolling interest reflected in other expenses additionally tax credit fund revenues finished the year with a very strong fiscal fourth quarter moving to slide clients domestic cash sweep balances which are the primary source of funding for interest earning assets in the balance of the thirdparty banks that generate rjbdp fees into the quarter at billion increasing sequentially and representing of domestic pcg client assets on slide the top chart displays our firm wide net interest income in rjbdp fees from thirdparty banks on a combined basis as these two items are directly impacted by changes in shortterm interest rate as you can see the interest rate cuts have put significant pressure on this revenue stream which on a combined basis are down million compared to the prior years fiscal fourth quarter this has had and is expected to continue to have provided significant headwinds for a compensation ratio in pretax margin particularly as these revenue streams are not directly compensable on the bottom of slide rj banks nim was in the fourth quarter just below the range weve guided to last quarter the sequential decline in nim was predominantly caused by the decline in libor as well as the higher concentration of lower yielding agencybacked securities on the banks balance sheet but remember while the agencybacked securities reduced the banks nim they do represent an increase in spread compared to what we earned offbalance sheet with thirdparty banks if libor rates have bottomed out going forward the banks nim should really be impacted more by asset mix and market spread but based on what we know now we are expecting the banks nim could be around in fiscal on the bottom right portion of the slide the average yield on rjbdp fees up basis points while down significantly yearoveryear due to lower shortterm interest rates was flat sequentially we expect this to remain around basis points in fiscal moving to consolidated expenses on slide first compensation expense which is by far our largest expense the compensation ratio decreased sequentially from to during the quarter primarily due to record revenues in the capital markets segment which had a compensation ratio during the quarter the yearoveryear increase in the compensation ratio was primarily due to the negative impact from lower short term interest rates as i explained on the last slide during the quarter we announced a reduction in force which is something we very seldom do given our strong culture and the value we place on stability at raymond james but the reduction was unfortunately unavoidable given the significant impact of the unexpected interest rate cuts in march all else being equal we expect the reduction in force to benefit the compensation ratio and consolidated pretax margin by approximately basis points starting in the fiscal first quarter of however it is important to remember that the compensation ratio is also impacted by revenue mix given the different compensation ratios in each one of our segments pcg has the highest compensation ratio due to the independent contractor channel where advisors received high payouts because they cover most of their overhead expenses like real estate the compensation ratio is also impacted by the level of recruiting activity as transition assistance is amortized in the compensation line for example this year advisor transition assistance and retention amortization had an impact of approximately basis points to the firms overall compensation ratio raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 so a lot of moving parts but given nearzero shortterm interest rates we are confident we can maintain a compensation ratio of or better especially after the reduction in force and thats utilizing conservative assumptions relative to the record capital markets results we achieved in the fiscal fourth quarter in fiscal year i will touch a bit more on compensation on the next slide onto noncompensation expenses noncompensation expenses of million increased yearoveryear as lower business development expenses were more than offset by a higher bank loan loss provision along with million associated with reduction in the workforce expenses and a million loss associated with the pending disposition of certain noncore operations in france other expenses also increased during the quarter due to several items hitting during the quarter including a reserve for state franchise taxes the aforementioned non controlling interest associated with the private equity valuation gains and a couple of other items i know many of you may ask what our guidance is for noncompensation expenses in fiscal unfortunately there is just too much uncertainty to provide guidance on that line item for example business development expenses and bank loan loss provision expenses are two items that will be heavily influenced by the covid19 pandemic and the economic recovery throughout the year what i can tell you is we are extremely focused on managing each and every single one of the controllable expenses while still investing in growth and highservice levels for our advisors and their clients turning to slide theres been a lot of focus on expense management over the past few years so we thought it was appropriate to take a minute to reflect on the trend this chart depicts the yearoveryear growth rate of administrative compensation expense in the private client group segment since fiscal year we highlight this particular expense item because it incorporates the majority of the compensation growth associated with the infrastructure buildup we have been focused on over the past several years including the majority of technology operations and risk management control areas as we fully allocate almost all these expenses to the businesses and pcg is by far our largest business as you can see after shortterm interest rates started increasing at the end of we reinvested our large portion of the spread benefit into our businesses to strengthen our platform about two years ago we told you that we would start decelerating that growth which you can really see this fiscal year with a growth rate and after our recent reduction in force we expect this growth rate to be even lower maybe even close to flat in fiscal year and remember this administrative compensation also includes growthrelated expenses like new sales assistant that joined the firm with a recruited advisor so we hope to see this line grow over time just as long as we keep it lower than longterm revenue growth so this slide really highlights two things first we use this benefit of higher spread to reinvest in that business and ensure we have a platform that can support our future growth and we are glad we took advantage of that window of opportunity as we wouldnt want to be playing catchup with our infrastructure investments in this rate environment and secondly the deceleration of these expenses reinforces our longstanding approach to managing controllable expenses especially during difficult market environment slide shows the pretax margin trend over the past five quarters pretax margin was in the fiscal fourth quarter of and adjusted pretax margin was again i know many of you would want our guidance for this metric but theres just simply too much market uncertainty in the midst of this pandemic could give you targets with any level of confidence but the margins this quarter were obviously boosted by the record capital market results as this segment generates a pretax margin which is a record raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 on slide at the end of fiscal fourth quarter total assets were approximately billion a sequential increase this increase was primarily attributable to shifting client assets from thirdparty banks to raymond james bank for the continued purchases of securities liquidity is very strong cash at the parent was more than billion of which about billion are excess cash over our conservative target but we are intentionally maintaining even more cash than we typically hold given the high degree of market uncertainty so with cash at the parent of more than billion a total capital ratio of and a tier leverage ratio of we have substantial amount of capital and liquidity with plenty of flexibility to be both defensive and opportunistic slide provides a summary of our capital actions over the past five quarters in the fourth quarter we repurchased approximately  for million an average price of approximately per share as of october million remained available under the boards current share repurchase authorization in total over the past five quarters we returned nearly million to shareholders through dividends and repurchases under the boards authorization with our strong capital liquidity position we expect to continue share repurchases of at least million per quarter to offset sharebased compensation dilution in fiscal and we will certainly consider doing more buybacks during the year as well as appropriate on the next two slides we provide additional detail on the banks loan portfolio slide provides some detail in raymond james banks asset composition in the pie chart you can see we have a really welldiversified portfolio with a focus over the past few years to grow residential mortgages and securitiesbased loan to private client group clients as well as significantly increase the size of the securities portfolio which ended the quarter at billion or of the banks total assets these securities are almost all agencybacked securities so we have a much more diversified portfolio now than we did before the last financial crisis the slide also highlights the diversification we have within each segment of the portfolio lastly on slide we provide key credit metrics for raymond james bank during the quarter we opportunistically sold approximately million of corporate loans at the average selling price of of our value in total over the past two quarters we sold nearly million of corporate loans associated with industries we believe are most vulnerable to the covid19 pandemic while we are now much more confident with the remaining corporate loans in our portfolio we will continue to be opportunistic in selling certain corporate loans but weve also recently resumed being opportunistic and deliberate in investing in new corporate loans that are in sectors that we believe are less negatively impacted by the covid19 crisis quarterly net chargeoffs of million were all related to the aforementioned loan sales during the quarter the quarterly loan loss provision of million resulted in the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans to increase to and for the corporate portfolios the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of ci loans increased to and for cre loans it increased to while nonperforming assets remained low at just basis points of total assets in the fourth quarter the amount of criticized loans increased as we have still been proactive in downgrading loans as we get more information but we have experienced positive trends with deferrals during the quarter as of september only of our corporate loans representing of balances were on covidrelated deferral which was down from in the preceding quarter similarly residential mortgages on covidrelated deferrals declined from of balances in the preceding quarter to just of balances at the end of the quarter raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 we implemented cecl on october which we expect will increase our allowances by approximately million to million with the majority of that increase attributable to recruiting and retention related loans to financial advisors in pcg which now require a larger allowance under cecl than it did under the incurred loss method going forward our allowances and provision expenses will be impacted by macroeconomic conditions as well as individual loan performance using the cecl model and as the surge in covid cases in the past two weeks has reminded us we are not out of the woods yet now im turning the call back over to paul reilly to discuss our outlook paul paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc thank you paul as for our outlook we are extremely wellpositioned entering fiscal with strong capital ratios and quarter and record for client assets and the number of private client group financial advisors however we will face continued headwinds from a full year of lower shortterm interest rates and theres still a high degree of uncertainty given the covid19 pandemic and upcoming presidential and congressional election in the private client group segment our financial advisor recruiting pipeline is strong across all of our affiliation options and the segment is going to benefit by starting the fiscal first quarter of with a sequential increase of assets and feebased accounts in the capital markets segment investment banking activity levels remain strong and were cautiously optimistic so long as the economic conditions dont deteriorate that that will continue and in fixed income brokerage revenues have remained strong thus far in october but weve set a high bar to keep up with for next year in the asset management segment results will be positively impacted by higher financial assets under management as long as the equity markets remain resilient and raymond james bank will continue to benefit from the attractive growth of mortgages and securitiesbased loans to pcg clients given the high degree of uncertainty well continue to be conservative and cautious with adding to the corporate loan portfolio and we will be ready and willing to resume more significant corporate loan growth when the economic outlook is more certain our growth priorities remain unchanged our top priority is organic growth which is primarily driven by retaining and recruiting advisors in the private client group and as i stated earlier our annual organic pcg domestic net new asset growth of in fiscal year has been bestinclass in the industry despite the covid19 related challenges additionally we are continuing to add senior talent in our other businesses such as investment banking we also continue to actively pursue acquisitions we will still be deliberate and pursue only transactions that are of great cultural fit as well as a strategic and economic benefit we are entering into more discussions than ever as we see the year end coming closer and the economic uncertainty has brought more people to the table as paul shoukry mentioned we are still continuing to repurchase shares to offset sharebased compensation solution and are prepared to increase repurchases as appropriate when the economic outlook is clear before we open the line for questions i want to thank all of our associates and advisors again for their invaluable contributions during these trying times im incredibly proud of our accomplishments and the tireless efforts to raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 support each other and our clients we are entering fiscal wellpositioned in all of our businesses and we have significant opportunities for continued growth we have something special here at raymond james where we have the scale and scope of services to compete with the largest firms in the industry while at the same time having this unique advisor and clientfacing culture thats increasingly difficult to find in our industry as long as we preserve that unique competitive advantage and advisorcentric attitude im confident in our ability to generate relatively attractive longterm returns for our shareholders in any market with that operator id like to open it up for questions question and answer section operator certainly well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc hey manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i know you hey so i know you dont have any guidance around pretax margins in the near term i mean i noticed that theres a lot of uncertainty especially on the noncomp side side but i was wondering if you can help us with where you think you can manage the business once were past the loan loss cycle but we still have lower rates and as you speak to that maybe you can also talk to the puts and takes out from the adjusted margin you have this quarter and with the headwinds out from your and those rates and in hiring but it also sounds like you have some more room on the expense side so if you can give us more details there paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah like you said a lot of moving parts so obviously the record result in capital markets which generated i think a margin certainly lifted the firms overall margins and thats just a high bar going forward and then business development expenses obviously still subdued given the covid19 pandemic and the provisions are elevated hopefully theyre elevated hopefully they get better going forward as we have more economic certainty so a lot of puts and takes which is why its hard to give you guidance here nearterm what i can tell you is if you look historically at our pretax margin last time we were in a kind of nearzero rate environment we were raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 generating roughly a type pretax margin now were entering this period with higher recruiting results coming into this period so that leads to higher transition assistance amortization i think the impact of that relative to that period of time is about basis points so were not really ready to give targets yet but if you just do that math it will get you to about a to type pretax margin but again that could be two years out i mean depending on market conditions paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think the other challenge is private client group will have tailwinds with the starting in their asset base into the quarter but obviously capital markets have very very strong results and especially ph middle of the quarter i mean capital markets is lumpy by nature of closings or lumpy by nature so its just challenging to come with a number but again were razorfocused on expenses weve operated in that to margin when we had no help from interest rate not that many years ago so in the same team so were focused on managing our expenses and on growth so its just hard to give guidance given pandemic may impact loan loss reserves which will certainly impact the numbers or the company continue to operate in our portfolio they wont be elevated so its just too difficult to give a number manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it then maybe on the securities side you added about billion to your securities for this quarter but at the same time it looks like deposits at both thirdparty banks and rjf bank were up quite substantially in the quarter as youre getting a fair amount of deposit growth do you have some sort of target amount that you are comfortable holding in securities and can you talk a little bit about how youre thinking about the duration risk its long indiscernible from there paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i think we still want to be more exposed to the short end of the curve than the long end of the curve just given the floating rate nature of our deposits so we did grow securities substantially but if you think about our balance sheet priorities in terms of where we want to grow the bank the first priority would be growing loans to private client group clients both mortgages and securitiesbased loans really because it has twopronged benefit the first is it helps us strengthen our advisors strengthen their relationships with their clients with really whats a competitive mortgage and securitiesbased loan offering and it also generates a very good riskadjusted return for the bank so its not sort of a winwin which is why thats the highest priority and it fortunately has been growing pretty consistently at an attractive rate our second priority typically is growing the corporate loan portfolio but obviously given the pandemic that were in the midst of weve actually been selling loans as you know and were going to be very selective in adding new loans that are less exposed to the covid19 pandemic and then really our third priority is growing the securities particularly now when the incremental yield you get for the duration exchange is paltry relative to the riskreturn tradeoff so were going to do that all in the context of raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 trying to keep the banks standalone tier leverage ratio at around give or take which is where it is now after weve grown the securities portfolio right around and we could always we have a lot more capital we have a ratio at the firm overall so we could always contribute more capital to the bank if one of those three categories of assets that the bank generates higher volumes at attractive riskadjusted return so thats kind of how were thinking about it so while we have a lot of capital and cash capacity to grow the bank more rapidly given where we are in the midst of this covid19 pandemic i think were going to be very patient in deploying that capacity manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so it sounds like you would indiscernible sorry sorry paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was just saying so indiscernible paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so it sounds like you would end up growing the securities both just in line with the cash and indiscernible youre getting from clients paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc thats probably a oversimplification i think well just grow it sort of as we have excess capacity to grow the banks balance sheet relative to the loan growth manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator and thank you for your question up next we have a question from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc hey guys this is michael anagnostakis filling in for steven congrats on a great quarter just wanted to start off with one on the expense savings opportunity i guess my question is based on the expense actions youre taking raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 assuming some normalization of activity how should we think about efficiency levels or how were going to see that impact flow through the expense run rate and should we expect a slower pace of expense growth from here thanks so much paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc i think what i said in my prepared remarks was that the reduction in the workforce would benefit the compensation ratio and the pretax margin all else being equal which it never is but all else being equal itd benefit those two metrics by about basis points starting in the fiscal first quarter of paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i think that certainly the difference is we saw the expense chart that paul talked about earlier so we are managing expenses very tightly so certainly we see this year on an applestoapples basis that growth as paul said could be indiscernible so were managing it very tightly now if the economy opens up and theres more business development and indiscernible certainly that will impact expenses but as you can see the expenses of managing down it before the pandemic by the results last year and the expense from the reduction in force really benefit starting this quarter so i think youre going to see tighter indiscernible to your business expense management given the environment just as we did years ago in a zerorate environment michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc all right great thanks my followup maybe just pivoting over to ma weve seen continued consolidation in the asset management space could you give some color around your appetite for potentially doing a deal in that space or maybe other areas thanks again paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah i think our priorities on ma havent changed the first is with focus on the private client group theres an area of where to our main business but there arent a lot of opportunities generally in that space that move the needle and our type of wealth management business but certainly are active there and are proactive reaching out and then just the same we continue to grow that business organically through recruiting and through strategic niche acquisition and certainly looking there and asset management is also an area wed look to add to the products and opportunities so those are the areas we focused on but were open in any parts that actually improve our businesses and strategically will have a longterm impact we arent looking at deals for size so theres been indiscernible in the market thats really just to call a financial engineering or lower revenue or advisor or and were looking at really staying true to our core businesses and growing and expanding our service offerings not just as being bigger for bigger sake michael anagnostakis q analyst wolfe research llc thanks thanks a lot guys appreciate it raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 operator thank you continuing on we now have a question from the line of bill katz with citigroup please go ahead william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you very much for taking my question this morning first question just maybe staying on the capital management theme for a moment you mentioned that yeah obviously a lot of firepower in the balance sheet and that you look to sort of pick up buyback as sort of things improve can you give us a sense of what milestones you might be looking at at the macroeconomic level so you get that comfort or perhaps some kind of valuation metric of your own stock that we can monitor to sort of see or anticipate some of your more than just the offset of stockbased comp dilution paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i mean thats a very complex question in terms of with longterm valuation metrics as weve looked to repurchase the difference right now is the environmental outlook which is hard to steady so theres a lot of theres also a lot of negative implications where regulators look around share repurchases and for those ill call it public interest in shareholder purchases so ph in our time right now where as we look at wave two which is obviously getting the country is when do we think indiscernible and we want capital not just for defensive purposes but we also believe that there is a more difficult economic comp as we see in this period drag out a little longer more interest ph and keep doing things so thats going to be the judgment call its not clear whats going to happen in these next couple of quarters with the pandemic and so until we get a view on that that we think wed get solid economic returns off that were going to hold back and make sure that we have plenty of capital to be both defensive and offensive so i cant give you a ph straight answer around it william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful and then last and maybe just a followup question indiscernible paul just in terms appreciate all the guidance around expenses where you can given your very strong recruiting pipeline and i appreciate this is a very fluid fiscal year for you the business development costs in this particular quarter is this a fair run rate relative to the recruitment pipeline or is there some potential lift in that given the very strong recruitment pipeline that youre speaking to paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i mean the business development costs down i think yearoveryear just reflects a lack of travel clientrelated activity relative to normal activity levels so i would expect as we get through the covid crisis for business development costs too expensive to get much closer to where they were maybe even going back to the first quarter of the fiscal year even with that elevated recruiting but again it will depend on how much recruiting we do going forward but i would say certainly this quarters number was very low paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 and a lot of that too there are big numbers in conferences and things that have been postponed that we dont see really coming certainly weve moved back everything to the first half of the year but now our ph determined reward groups are educational conference these are important to us and our culture but those indiscernible some point but we dont see them coming in these next few quarters and true that this in recruiting weve pulled out a deferred recruiting we have a lot of ph commitment that have pushed back join dates because of covid and that breaks through i think wed expect some very very robust recruiting but i dont think that recruiting line in itself is a big driver of shortterm business development expenses william raymond katz q analyst citigroup global markets inc okay thank you both operator thank you for your question next we have a question from the line of chris harris with wells fargo please go ahead sir christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks guys so really strong quarter for investment banking you highlighted that can you guys maybe unpack the drivers for us a little bit more and really just kind of interested to know like how broadbased the strength is that youre seeing in investment banking or whether its somewhat concentrated in a handful of transactions and then how are you feeling about the sustainability of the revenues that youre seeing in banking paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc i can just tell you its been pretty broadbased our largest group tech services and real estate have continued to perform well it continued to perform well and i think their backlogs are very strong as well as the banking across all of our sectors which you can see from the industry is up so i would say our topperforming sectors have continued to outperform and the other sectors are having good years also so its pretty broadbased and if you look at backlog for backlog is not any good most of the deal closes its very very strong so again weve seen deals shut off and weve seen deals accelerate and i dont know if therell be a rush at the end of the year if theres a presidential and congressional changes and anticipated tax rate changes whether that rushes deals to close at year end so its just hard to tell but i can just tell you the activity is broadbased christopher harris q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and just a quick followup for paul shoukry i know theres a lot of moving parts to loan portfolio you want to be selective with ci but you could potentially see some growth in other areas maybe youll sell some more loans maybe not given all of that could we potentially see growth in the loan portfolio for fiscal paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc all right i think its possible especially depending on the growth in the private client group loans securities based loans i think we hope to still continue growing that over and the mortgage growth has been pretty raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 strong as well so thats certainly possible i think what were trying to do going forward is if you look at the slide that shows the combined interest net interest income and the bdp fees from thirdparty banks because you have to really look at it on a combined basis what were hoping is that this quarter i hate to call it trough because you never know but certainly the shortterm rates have sort of been fully reflected in the loan portfolio all the floating rate loans almost all of them have reset and so we hope to grow that number from this point forward assuming cash balances remain relatively resilient at the current level so thats the hope but again if we dont grow loans this year as much as we can given our capacity for cash and capital capacity then thatll just give us more dry powder for the next year and were going to grow loans when were especially the corporate loans when were comfortable with the sort of economic environment and the lack of certainty theres less uncertainty than there is now and were looking at this were making longterm decisions so if it takes two years to get to that level of comfort then well have more dry powder then and that rate of growth will be higher then if we dont grow it as much this year so were going to be patient and make the best decision based on what we know in the economic environment indiscernible paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc we are starting to see some ph corporate opportunities that look like decent spreads and some ph flow and some you go through cycles and so whether that continues or strengthens i dont know but again were i agree with paul were going to be cautious on those we are staying on the flow and looking at those opportunities operator thank you sir continuing on our next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global please go ahead james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a question up on the recruiting a little bit more detail if you could just sort of share where youre seeing the growth it does seem broadbased but is there any kind of geographic concentration is it mostly from the wirehouses still and maybe a little bit of an update on sort of the west coast where i think youve been have the least amount of penetration how is that thing going in terms of ramping that up paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so the color on recruiting its we looked and recruiting is great across all of our affiliation options from employee independent to the ria channel so weve been very pleased that the growth in all three id say recruiting has been broadbased as much as we focus southwest where weve continued to gain momentum theres still a lot of recruiting going in places where were strong like the midwest and other areas so thats very broadbased the wirehouses continue to be the primary contributor to our recruiting pipeline although there are other firms really through periods of time also get indiscernible but its mainly wirehousedriven and the recruiting outlook looks very very good and ph like for a minute joined pipeline looks very strong raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 and again a part of that is due to deferrals especially the employee channels our branches have been closed theyre open now but a lot of the folks during that period of time didnt want to move into a closed branch so the employees lagged a little bit in independent channel during this last year but were seeing activity across all the channels there james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thats helpful and maybe just on second question on the investment banking business obviously its strong pipeline strong is that an area that youre investing in to grow or is this just kind of reaping a good environment just trying to get a sense of what you think of sort of the organic or market share growth that you might be targeting in across investment banking paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc im sorry you guys havent noticed the investment because we have a lot of focus on growing the ma business acquiring a firm in europe which is done terrific a few years ago thats really added to our cross border adding a lot of very very senior bankers in healthcare and other areas and looking at boutiques and tuckins and so i think both the environment is good thats true earnings releases by everybody but the reason that our numbers were so good is weve invested in the bankers that made a big difference and well continue to so especially in ma where we are probably undersized given our size and our great capital market strength well continue to invest particularly in that area and hopefully given the rest of the business and our good research we can continue to grow that james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay thank you operator thank you continuing on our next question comes from devin ryan with jmp securities please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc hey good morning guys paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc hey devin devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc most have been asked here but just a couple kind of clean up so first one on just the election next week and then trying to think about some of the considerations to the extent there is an administration change and i appreciate theres a lot of nuance in terms of what happens there but are there any regulatory items that youre kind of focused on in an administration change whether itd be the potential for more onerous rule out to the raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 secs reg bi im not sure if it did well could ph reinsert itself of that thats in all in the conversation or state specifically you could feel more emboldened to disrupt kind of where the industry is moving towards im curious if theres any kind of chatter of that and then just more broadly thinking about the potential for higher tax rates and any businesses that you guys feel like that could impact for you paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah so devin its complicated so first the world always seems to turn when parties change so despite the changes we have to we all compete in the same environment so we feel very comfortable competing in whatever that environment is so i think if there is a congressional and presidential party changes certainly taxes are the ones that will be i mean im thinking most businesses shouldnt have a huge impact businesses will go on our tax credit business will probably benefit from it the higher the tax rate more value of those credits and i think indiscernible helping will still be targeted for the administration so think relative unless tax rates go totally crazy but the world will go on so regulatory we always monitor regulatory change and even with a what is considered a businessfriendly white house weve got some pretty big regulatory changes with the reg bi and so i think youre talking about matters of degree and could there be tweaks to that yes it doesnt look like the number one top one with the credit nominee with the regulatory reform so it really more accounts to whos put into indiscernible office and a number of the key ones that people are in those positions for a couple of years even at the elections they usually set the tone on enforcement and other things so i dont think theres going to be a shortterm impact no matter what the election is longer term certainly there could be so i think its all speculation we were the states we you always worry about individual states because it makes the business very complex but most of those changes indiscernible not come forward that depends major impacts to our business so its an unknown but well compete in whatever the environment is and whatever the rules are devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay thanks paul and just to follow up here just want to indiscernible kind of the expense conversation and just make sure that were fully appreciating all moving parts so i guess first and foremost is the valuation that you guys referenced last quarter is that now complete with all the changes and some of the detail that you provided here and then obviously the reduction in force or are there more things that youre looking at internally that could also move the needle on the expense trajectory from this point and then also i just want to make sure that it doesnt feel like theres probably any big revenue considerations from indiscernible but just want to make sure that were understanding that as well paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc so id say that first indiscernible not signing anymore so i mean so last time we really had any kind of reduction in force was after indiscernible a couple of years after the indiscernible acquisition where we did a small one but we waited a couple years trying to get everybody employed so i think thats behind us so theres nothing of that size raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 but we are managing infrastructure spend technology spend that you go across the board we are still looking at how do we get more efficient and continue to bring in costs we have a big service initiative going on as we play in highservice levels but we want to increase those from an advisor standpoint well look at areas not ph only to become better at service but be more efficient which is a longer term project for all over expenses but theres no big needle movers as the reduction in force was devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay perfect ill leave it there thank you guys paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc okay operator okay thank you and our next question comes from the line of kyle voigt with kbw please go ahead kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for taking my question any first shift on the afs portfolio wondering if you could help us understand where currently investment rates are with an average threeyear duration thats still fitting just under basis points and secondly i wonder if you were able to start opportunistic buybacks later this year does that change your desire to allocate capital to growing that afs portfolio at this pace paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah kyle youre right on with your kind of estimate on the yield its right around just under for sort of the threeyear type duration and in terms of the decision whether to buy back shares or grow the portfolio we have enough capital frankly to do both if we are comfortable doing both so we have a lot of capacity and flexibility and certainly the ability to do both just as we have been over the last couple years kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and just on the cash balances i mean those continue to grow quite nicely just wondering if you can just provide an update maybe on a longterm target for the percentage of those balances or how youre thinking about the percentage of balances that youre comfortable migrating to the balance sheet over time paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah i get a lot of variables in terms of the capital the returns that we were getting on the assets of refunding with the cash and frankly what the demand is from thirdparty banks which was very high in march when these banks were seeing revolver draws they needed the cash to cover those draws and since then there was a lot of those revolver draws have been paid back and the banking system is generally flushed with cash right now so we are on a net basis seeing some banks still want that cash but on a net basis the demand is diminishing so thats really the benefit of having a bank in our business is it gives us a lot of flexibility and if the demand raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 from thirdparty banks continue to diminish and things continue to recover in the economy and we have good risk adjusted returns and the assets of the bank and invest then then we would be comfortable putting in a large portion of those cash balances on the balance sheet so long as it doesnt compromise the clients ability to get the maximum fdic coverage were one of the few firms that offer up to million for a joint account of fdic coverage through our waterfall program and so it gives us a lot of flexibility to continue growing the balance sheet kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yes and then lastly for me and ill leave it there i just indiscernible question the reduction in force should we expect any additional onetime charges this quarter and i know you said it will impact the admin line within pcg just wondering what other segments we could see some level of impact on the computation paul shoukry a chief financial officer treasurer raymond james financial inc yeah we took the vast vast majority of the associated expense in that million this quarter so i dont think that therell be any meaningful numbers kind of going forward related to the reduction in force in terms of costs and then in terms of pgg is our largest business most of the support cost control cost risk management cost gets allocated to pcg but i think the reduction was fairly broadbased in terms of the businesses so i think youll just see it on a consolidated basis in the administrative compensation line item in each business but private client group business is by far the largest consumer of that administrative expense kyle voigt q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good yeah thank you paul operator thank you and our final question comes from the line of chris allen with compass point please proceed with your question chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc good morning guys two quick ones one im wondering if the if youve seen any changes ph comparing it to the recruiting environment just given some of the commentaries you heard from some of the big banks and ideally some of them getting a little more aggressive on packages wondering if youre seeing any change there paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah id say that first everyone since ive been in this job everybody asked that question and its always competitive right so sometimes players change sometimes even people say theyre getting out of the market recruiting make it out for a quarter or two and theyre right back in so its always been competitive and firms change or firms that have done better who paying a lot of money relative to what we pay for transitional assistance and i think weve kind of kept our great balance of being fair to the people coming over and having them come over for the environment so we get outbid sometimes yeah but thats not new for us raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 but what we believe is we offer the best home and the best tools and the best platform so its competitive out there and sometimes its more competitive in the independent channels people get aggressive the employee channel i think in this last quarter too people have really kind of been more aggressive in what theyre willing to pay and we continue to sell our longterm value proposition so its always competitive and weve done pretty good at this for a long time now so were keeping our focus and very happy with the great teams were bringing in chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah and just another quick one i saw a news article just in terms of you reorganized the ph cluster division just combining the broker dealer and hybrid indiscernible custody units im just wondering if that was done as looking more to be more offensive just given the merger for with indiscernible ameritrade and indiscernible on etrade just in terms of the opportunity around the ria custodial any color there would be helpful paul reilly a chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc yeah its a focused area of growth for us and weve had that division for a long time we felt that eventually with enough regulatory change i think bi was one of the i think acceleration of movement which we saw before june and somewhat slowing down now but the ria channel has been the fastest growing percentage wise in the industry for a long time so the move was really just to consolidate the scale of the businesses the custodial business and theyre much more related than theyre not so we want to combine to make sure that we have more size and scale to focus on that for management there chris allen q analyst compass point research trading llc thanks guys operator thank you ill now turn the presentation back to mr reilly to continue for his concluding remarks paul reilly chairman chief executive officer raymond james financial inc well thank you all for joining us so we know its harder jobs are like ours are predicting whats going to happen remember a lot of years where we could just kind of draw a line and look at trends and be pretty much tell you what was going to happen and certainly thats not this environment right now so well try to give you as much guidance as we can when we think we can see it we dont want to make up numbers or make up things just to help you put in the model that dont have a base so i think with the outlook its more difficult having said that i think you can see the commitment to expense reduction that weve talked about you can see it coming through last year it certainly is better this year and we are really focused on growth weve still been focused on growth and the one thing if you could really manage your expenses and continue to grow you get pretty good financial results so we think long term were doing the right thing weve got to focus and as we get more clarity well try to give it to you and hopefully happen now lets say soon we can give you good better targets than we could in the middle of this hopefully not a bad second wave of the pandemic raymond james financial inc rjf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 29oct2020 but thank you all for
