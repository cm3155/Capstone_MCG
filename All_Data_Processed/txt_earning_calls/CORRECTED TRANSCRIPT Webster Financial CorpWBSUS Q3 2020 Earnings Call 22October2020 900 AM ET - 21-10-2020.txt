higher than a year ago and our pipelines are solid hsa bank is winning more direct to employer relationships than a year ago our operational execution remains strong and we continue to manage credit and enterprise risk effectively turning to slide preprovision net revenue of million increased from q2 as revenue grew in excess of expenses earnings per share in the quarter were compared to in q2 and in the prior years third quarter our million provision resulted in a reserve build of million glenn will walk you through the assumptions underlying the cecl process and resulting provision for the quarter our third quarter return on common equity was and the return on tangible common equity was as i mentioned last quarter we remain confident in our ability to again sustainably generate economic profit even in this more economically challenging and lower interest rate environment ill provide further perspective in a few minutes loans grew from a year ago on slide or when excluding billion in ppp loans commercial loans grew more than from a year ago or by almost billion led by growth of more than million in high quality commercial real estate loans the decline in floating and periodic rate loans to total loans compared to a year ago reflects the billion of fixed rate ppp loans added in the second quarter deposits grew year overyear driven across all business lines core deposits exceeded billion and represent of total deposits compared to a year ago while cds declined million from a year ago slide through set forth key performance statistics for our three lines of business commercial banking is on slide loan balances increased almost from a year ago excluding ppp loans both investor cre and ci businesses in middle market banking and sponsor and specialty saw a doubledigit loan growth yearoveryear deposits up from a year ago are nearly billion at september as our commercial clients maintain liquidity on their balance sheets commercial deposits were up linkedquarter on seasonal ph strength in our treasury and payments solutions business which includes government banking hsa bank is on slide core deposit growth was yearoveryear or excluding the impact of the state farm transaction which closed in the third quarter and added accounts and million in deposit balances we continued to see strong increases in new direct to employer business opportunities throughout the quarter winning more new hsa rfps than we did last year specifically in the large employer space webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 covid19 has impacted the hsa business with new account openings lower from prior year when adjusting for the state farm acquisition this is consistent with the industry and is due to slower hiring trends across our employer customers hsa consumer spending increased in the quarter a trend we expect to continue as elective medical services continue to open up across the country this spending rebound had a favorable impact on interchange revenue when compared to q2 tpa accounts and balances declined and million respectively linked quarter continuing the outmigration of accounts that we disclosed a year ago in the quarter we recognized approximately million of account closure fees related to the outmigration performance fundamentals of hsa bank and the broader hsa market remain strong with ample opportunity for continued growth and while its too early to forecast the upcoming january enrollment season were pleased with the large direct to employer wins weve recorded in this challenging selling season im now on slide community banking loans grew almost yearoveryear and declined slightly excluding ppp business banking loans grew from a year ago when excluding ppp personal banking loans decreased from a year ago as an increase in residential mortgages was offset by declines in home equity and other consumer loans community banking deposits grew yearoveryear with consumer and business deposits growing and respectively the total cost of community banking deposits was basis points in the quarter thats down basis points from a year ago net interest and noninterest income both improved from prior year driven by increased loan and deposit balances and by mortgage banking and swap fees respectively selfservice transactions declined slightly linked quarter as we expanded and opened banking centers with enhanced safety protocols but grew yearoveryear reflecting the continued shift in consumer preference to digital channels the next two slides address credit metrics and trends our september reported credit metrics remain favorable and actually improved modestly which glenn will review in more detail while pleased with the reported metrics we nonetheless remain appropriately cautious on credit as we continue to operate through the considerable uncertainties presented by the pandemic on slide weve updated our disclosure on the commercial loan sectors most directly impacted by covid including payment deferral information the key points on this slide are that overall loan outstandings to these sectors have declined from june and the payment deferrals have declined million or on slide we provide more detail across our entire billion commercial and consumer loan portfolio the key takeaway here is that payment deferrals declined by to million at september and now represent of total loans compared to at june consistent with industry trends weve had meaningful declines in payment deferrals in every loan category from june to september of the million of payment deferrals at september million or are firsttime deferrals cares act and interagency statement payment deferrals which are included in the million of total payment deferrals at september decreased to from june and now total just million while pandemic related challenges remain we are pleased to have been able to provide considerable support to our customers and communities under our mission to help individuals families and businesses achieve their financial goal as i stated last quarter we are actively monitoring risk we are making realtime credit rating decisions and addressing potential credit issues proactively we continue to feel good about the quality of our risk selection our underwriting our portfolio management capabilities and the strength of our capital and credit allowance positions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 ill now turn it over to glenn for the financial review glenn i macinnes executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp thanks john ill begin with our average balance sheet on slide average securities grew million or linked quarter and represented of total asset at september largely in line with levels over the past year average loans grew million or linked quarter ppp loans averaged billion in q3 and grew million from q2 reflecting the full quarter impact of loans funded last quarter we had no forgiveness activity on ppp loans during the quarter and therefore no acceleration of deferred fees during the quarter we had million of ppp fee accretion and the remaining deferred fees total million apart from ppp loans commercial real estate loans increased million or while assetbased and other commercial loans decreased million and million respectively the million decline in consumer loans includes million in home equity and million in residential mortgages deposits increased billion linked quarter well in excess of the combined growth of million in loans and securities we saw increases across all of deposit categories except cds which declined million or nearly the cost of cds declined basis points and was a significant driver of our reduction in deposit costs public funds increased to million in a seasonally strong third quarter while the cost of these deposits declined from basis points to basis points borrowings declined million from q2 and now represents of total assets compared to at june and in prior year regulatory riskweighted capital ratios increased due to growth in equity the tangible common equity ratio increased to that would be basis points higher excluding the billion in riskweighted ppp loans tangible book value per share at quarterend was an increase of from june and from prior year slide summarizes our income statement and drivers of quarterly earnings net interest income declined million from prior quarter lower rates resulted in a quarteroverquarter decline of million in interest income from earning asset this was partially offset by million due to lower deposit and borrowing cost and million as a result of loan and security balance growth as a result our net interest margin was basis points lower linked quarter core loan yields and balances contributed basis points to the decline with ppp loans contributing another basis points in the decline lower reinvestment rates on our securities portfolio resulted in basis points of nim compression while higher premium amortization resulted in an additional basis points of nim compression this was partially offset by a basis point reduction in deposit cost reflective of reduced rates across all categories which benefited nim by basis points and fewer borrowings contributed another basis points of nim benefit as compared to prior year net interest income declined million million of the decline was the net result of lower market rate which were partially offset by million in earning asset growth noninterest income increased million linked quarter and million from prior year hsa fee income increased million linked quarter interchange revenue increased million driven by a linked quarter increase in debit transaction volume we also recognized million of exit fees on tpa accounts during the quarter the mortgage banking revenue increase of million linked quarter was split between increased origination activity and higher spread deposit webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 service fees increased million quarteroverquarter driven by overdraft and interchange fees consumer and business debit transactions increased linked quarter other income increased million primarily due to a discrete fair value adjustment on our customer hedging book recorded last quarter the increase in noninterest income for prior year reflects higher mortgage banking revenue and hsa fee income partially offset by lower deposit service and loan related fees reported non interest expense of million included million of professional fees driven by our strategic initiatives which john will review in more detail we also saw a linked quarter increase of million from higher medical cost due to an increase in utilization noninterest expense increased million or from prior year the efficiency ratio remained at pre provision net revenue was million in q3 this compares to million in q2 and million in prior year the provision for credit loss for the quarter was million which i will discuss in more detail on the next slide and our effective tax rate was compared to in q2 turning to slide ill review the results of our third quarter allowance for loan losses under cecl as highlighted the allowance for credit losses to loans increased to or excluding ppp loans we have summarized the key aspects of our macroeconomic scenario which reflect the gradual improvement in employment with real gdp returning to precovid levels in the forecast improved slightly from prior quarter but was offset by commercial risk rating migration resulting in a provision of million the million allowance reflects our estimate of life of loan losses as of september we will continue to assess the effects of credit quality loan modifications and the macroeconomic conditions as we move through the pandemic slide highlights our key asset quality metrics as of september nonperforming loans in the upper left decreased million from q2 commercial real estate residential mortgage and consumer each saw linked quarter declines while commercial increased million net chargeoffs in the upper right decreased from second quarter and totaled million after million in recoveries ci gross chargeoffs declined slightly and totaled million primarily reflecting credits that were already experiencing difficulty prior to the onset of the pandemic commercial classified in the lower left represented basis points of total commercial loans this compares to a quarter average of basis points and the allowance for credit losses increased to million as discussed on the prior slide slide highlights our liquidity metrics our diverse deposit gathering sources continue to provide us with considerable flexibility deposit growth of million exceeded total asset growth and lowered the loan to deposit ratio to our sources of secured borrowing capacity increased further and totaled billion at september slide highlights our strong capital metrics regulatory capital ratios exceeded wellcapitalized levels by substantial amounts our common equity tier ratio of exceeds wellcapitalized by more than billion likewise tier riskbased capital exceeds wellcapitalized levels by million looking to the fourth quarter we expect stable loan balances with modest ppp forgiveness assuming a flat rate environment with an average one month libor in the range of basis points and an average 10year treasury swap rate around basis points we believe we are near the bottom of core nim compression noninterest income will likely be lower linked quarter due to reduction in mortgage banking income and lower hsa fees on tpa accounts core noninterest expense will remain in the range of q3 and our tax rate will be around webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 with that ill turn things back over to john for a review of our strategic initiatives john r ciulla chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks glenn im now on slide and as ive mentioned on recent earnings calls we have been and remain focused on revenue enhancements and operational efficiencies across the organization well before the onset of the pandemic our management team recognized that we would be operating in a low interest rate and more challenging business environment for an extended period of time in january we began an enterprisewide assessment of our organization to identify revenue opportunities and cost savings using a very thorough and systematic process the onset of the pandemic in march further impacted the operating environment and accelerated changes in customer preferences and shifting workplace dynamics this not only made our commitment to this process that much stronger but it also expanded the opportunities we have to rationalize and align our expenses with our business line execution weve identified and begun to implement dozens of initiatives across the bank a handful of which are set forth on slide that will result in driving incremental revenue reducing our overall cost structure and enhancing our digital capabilities to meet our customers needs and to reduce our cost of delivery of products and services our focus remains first on key revenue and asset growth drivers including accelerating growth in commercial bank by building on our proven track record in select specialized industries driving hsa bank growth through improved sales productivity and customer retention and continuing to grow in community core markets through product enhancements we are also focused on efficiency and organizational alignment simplifying our org structure capturing targeted back office synergies and redesigning and automating critical processes we also are rationalizing and consolidating our retail and corporate real estate footprint through this process we will continue to improve the customer experience by enhancing digital capabilities modernizing foundational systems and improving analytical capabilities we have begun executing on many of these initiatives and we recently made a series of organizational changes to position us for success over the next year and well beyond we plan to provide more detailed information on these initiatives including additional financial details and timing on realization on our fourth quarter earnings call in january as we are continuing to work through all of the final decision what i will say is that with respect to efficiency opportunities we anticipate reducing our current expense base by to fully realized on a run rate basis by the fourth quarter of next year we see considerable opportunity above and beyond that as revenue initiatives and further efficiency gains are realized late in and in as we stated last quarter we remain confident that even if the current operating environment persists with low interest rates and economic uncertainty that execution on our identified revenue enhancements and efficiency opportunities will allow us to sustainably generate returns in excess of our estimated of cost of capital by the end of our vision remains consistent and its to strengthen our position as a major regional bank in the northeast that lead with a distinctive and expanding commercial business and aggressively growing and winning national hsa bank business a strong community bank franchise in our core markets all supported by an efficient and scalable operating model i want to say a big thank you to all of our bankers for their incredible work during these challenging times with that maria glenn chad jason and i are prepared to take questions webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 question and answer section operator at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please proceed steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp steve how are you steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi john i want to understand the comments around reducing the expense base so this to reduction that if we look at this quarters expense its about million million would be the midpoint are you saying by of next year that will be in the run rate is that the expectation john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp right and i think we can outperform that steve but were absolutely confident to put that bogey out there so i think you have the quarterly expense base a little bit lower glenn can talk about that but thats exactly what we mean so if you look at third quarter kind of core expenses we expect to achieve a reduction in those expenses by the fourth quarter of next year glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp run rate perspective john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp our stated core our gaap expenses for the quarter million almost million and there were some onetime cost in there but you can use those as ph approximate steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc as a base okay so and that will obviously help with but as you think about next year i think were all struggling with what pretax preprovision income growth could be for everyone right and glenn its helpful that nim is close to a bottom but could you frame for us obviously this is going to set up a better situation two years from now but talk to us about the ability to grow pretax preprovision next year john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 steve ill give you a little obviously were not going to provide detailed guidance but ill give you a little bit of perspective in the fourth quarter well talk as we work through our final analytics and make final decisions well be able to provide you with kind perspective in the fourth quarter well talk as we work through our final analytics and make final decisions well be able to provide you with kind of our quarterly realization of expense saves and revenue enhancement so we will see progressive improvement in our operations over the course of so it doesnt all just magically appear at the end of the year i think from a top line perspective the we think that were roughly at the bottom of nim compression if rates kind of stay where they are we have confidence that well be able to grow assets fees are hard to predict in this environment and obviously provision from a net income perspective i know you asked about ppnr is kind of a wild card from a profitability perspective so our full plan is to improve incremental profitability and ppnr each of the quarters in so were not kicking the can forward but we wanted to put a stake in the ground of what we expect to do from sort of a structural realignment of the way we operate into so i would say stay tuned for more details in our january call but also we fully expect if the operating environment stayed stable that we would see incremental improvement in each of the quarters in glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp and steve the only thing i would add to that is and its not poor but as i indicated in my prepared remarks we have about million in deferred fees in ppp and we expect during the course of most of that would probably be forgiven so that will impact earnings as well up to say million million steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and to shift to credit actually before i ask my question if we look at the covid19 impacted loan slide do those balances include any leveraged loans or are those outside of those buckets and then i have one question john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp those are all sectorbased and they would include any ones we have related to those segments jason i dont know whether you want to put a more color on that jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah no both slides include leveraged loans both on the sector slide and if you look at the next page leverage is actually broken out separately so you can see the detail there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah okay so i think some were adding leverage on top of those but thats already included okay thats helpful webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thats correct correct steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so now i mean weve been looking at this slide now for two quarters can you talk to us in terms of the deeper dive youve done at the portfolio and where youre now most concerned for losses thanks john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure steve jason ill go right to you and then maybe ill make some comments jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah so when we think about overall losses look we do a deep dive we have weekly meetings with the lines of business to assess modifications deferrals trends get a lot of color from our borrowers because were having conversations regularly if you think about in terms of total losses think about the in the near term i would say its going to be the troubled sector that were all focused on we had some credits that were pushed over the edge initially that were having trouble before covid going forward its going to be the sectors that were that everybody is focused on being hotels travel and leisure media restaurants but going forward i guess what i would say generally is im a little concerned about the business banking small business portfolio but if you look at the dda deposits for those borrowers overall at ph million versus precovid theyre actually very healthy and deferrals overall are sort of going down so you feel cautiously encouraged at the moment in terms of how that portfolio is going to perform so i think there are pockets of risk throughout the portfolio that were focusing on but i dont see any area where we have significant concentration that im overly concerned about so we had a good quarter in terms of third quarter in terms of charges and npls i think those numbers will likely get a bit worse throughout before they return to normalized levels but i continue to be cautiously encouraged and i think that the likelihood of some additional stimulus given the rise in cases throughout the country will also be helpful and necessary at some level john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah jason id say steve if you look at our slight tickup in classifieds the biggest contributors were those sectors that jason just referenced we do look at whether or not we need specific reserves on those credits we dont have a lot of identified embedded loss so i do think there are some wildcards about path of the virus about the level of stimulus but i too agree with jason that its really sectorbased were not seeing any differences in performance across geographies business units or those elements or product type it really relates to whether a sector needs people to gather and be close together and travel so i think those are the big keys and fortunately relative to our peers weve got lower exposure in those categories which were happy about steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 terrific thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah thanks steve operator our next question is from collyn gilbert with kbw please proceed collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning guys john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey good morning collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc this is great color on the expense plan and certainly a great plan so appreciate that john you had alluded to that maybe in the beginning of next year well get a little bit more color and just curious kind of broadly i know you put it in the slides but just broadly where youre going to see kind of some of those savings come i know you mentioned real estate rationalization or is there any more color you can offer just kind of broadly as to where you see those expense reductions coming john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its just difficult in terms of where we are in the process to give specifics because some final decisions havent been made but i think youre right if you look at our retail branch network if you look at our corporate space with the changing work environment we expect to gain material efficiencies in those categories were also automating manual processes combining like functions across hsa and webster and creating centers of excellence that not only we believe will bring us efficiencies but as importantly collyn will make our ability to deliver for our customers better and take out defects and so were pretty excited about some of the preliminary work were doing and were prepared to put the cost bogey out there because weve been working on this for or months glenn referenced the additional expense related to the project were obviously using professionals and outside help to go through this process and we think it will change the way we do business and transform the organization so we look forward to sharing more in the first quarter on our call but were not really prepared to go any deeper right now collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay and then just in terms of kind of your outlook for loan growth with the comment that you made the intention is to try to continually to build ppnr next year any where do you see the opportunities to kind of grow the loan book either from a geographic perspective or from a loan segmentation perspective webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah no i think thats a great question and ill relate it a little bit to steves question on credit performance that it really ends up being sectorbased and were fortunate as we said before to have either been really good or a combination of lucky and good in where we play so we dont have a lot of were not relying on a lot of oil and gas were not relying on leisure hotels and so weve been focused as you know in healthcare technology and technology infrastructure which is our largest exposure in the sponsor and specialty business and its not only performed brilliantly during the pandemic but its actually accelerated so we had million in new originations in sponsor and specialty in q3 our commercial real estates been really good weve been focusing a lot on albeit lower earning but really highquality institutional government transactions in our middle market group so we had million in commercial bank originations in the quarter which sort of is similar to what we had in q1 before the pandemic really set in so i think for us theres no question that loan demand is going to be muted thats just the way its going to be because i think theres going to be uncertainty not as much corporate confidence and investment and i think even individuals as you know are keeping very liquid right now so i think demand will be down but i think there will be pockets and sectors where we play very well where well continue to make new loans so and i do think what we said in in our call that even though before we had seen any behaviors our guess was that loan origination would be lower but that prepayments would be lower thats all coming true so this quarter we saw loan growth on lower originations in commercial and we obviously had kind of really high mortgage origination so i think well still see mortgage well see some growth in personal loans and in commercial in the sectors where we perform best and where we have great relationships and are not being negatively impacted by the pandemic i still think we have confidence that we can grow asset collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great and then just one final question on ma and youre welcome to answer it relative to hsa or the bank but just curious as to how you guys are thinking about potential acquisitions as you look out need for scale obviously youre addressing it within your own organization but what kind of opportunities are a little bit longer term or more broadly for you guys to really increase scale through acquisitions again through either the core bank or the hsa bank john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp sure its a great question and our comments have evolved over the last couple of years on the calls from a complete focus internally to a recognition that we do think scale is really important and so i would say that were always looking you saw the state farm transaction there are other transactions like that in the marketplace that we look at all the time with respect to hsa portfolio acquisitions teams of commercial bankers those are things we would act on regardless of what the environment is and we do think that there is a higher likelihood that we would be engaged in some sort of bank ma on the other side of this and so what you see right now is our laser focus on making sure that we are recognizing our potential from ppnr perspective and evaluation perspective by focusing on being the best we can be scalable and nimble which i think will put us in a really good position because we webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 believe that there will be more ma in the midcap bank space coming out the other side of this and we want to make sure were controlling our destiny and as i said wed never say never were focused internally now but we do want to gain scale when there is clear visibility on the other side of credit through this pandemic collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great all right thanks i will leave it there operator our next question is from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please proceed mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp mark good morning mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co just to follow up on one maybe for jason i know its hard to sort of estimate theres lots of variables at this point but based on what you see today how are you thinking about provisioning levels in say the fourth quarter and beyond jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yes sure i could start and maybe glenn you want to jump in as well so when you think about some of the bigger drivers ratings migration right you saw we had some migration to classified this quarter i would say as we got a view into revenue recovery in the third quarter from a lot of our borrowers right many of them recovered very quickly some of them we realized its going to take a little bit longer those are the ones that we downgraded to classified i feel like at this point weve got to book well rated and well probably be calling balls and strikes over the next few quarters so i dont see a major level of migration at this point some of the situations in special mention they may deteriorate but youll probably have just as many if not more that will improve so i dont see a huge pressure barring an increase in cases or something falls apart in terms of additional stimulus i dont see a huge pressure on reserves in the short term but obviously that could change based on the environment mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 mark let me just jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp indiscernible add anything to that john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah mark i will this is john and then ill let glenn provide the ph technically and just from top of the house i think this quarter mark is a really nice demonstration of kind of the way the process is supposed to work we had very little aggregate loan growth so you think about the portfolio not growing that much which means you didnt need to increase your provision for life of loan losses for a lot of incremental exposure you saw the moodys outlook that us and many of our peers used sort of get marginally to more favorable so that didnt require we kind of look at it to flat to slightly better some of the qualitative factors around the level of modifications and everything came down so that would require lower and then you saw a little bit of drift into classified some internal risk rating migration lower which kind of offsets those other positives and lo and behold we had million in net chargeoffs we built our reserve a little bit so it really depends on how fast we can grow loans going into next year what happens in our risk migration and what the path of the virus does to moodys forward look to really give you an indication of kind of where we might be from a provisioning perspective glenn glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp no i think between you and jason you covered it the only thing i would add is that most of us are using in the midcap space were using the moody baseline forecast and just keep in mind that has about trillion in stimulus built into it so plus or minus depending on what happens there but as john and jason both pointed out i mean i see it more as we look at the thing from a duration standpoint and right now liquidity seems good customer seems strong but its all going to be a matter of the course of the pandemic and liquidity and so were keeping a very close eye on it mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly it looked like i mean the deferral trends look terrific i guess im curious is there dramatic differences across the various geographies that you all traffic in as new york and new york city being much harder hit ph are the deferral rates much higher than they are say in connecticut or ph upper john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah its interesting and ill ask jason obviously for his comment but mark its funny and i just mentioned that when steve asked the question we havent seen real differences in geographies its been much more sector based right its not whether youre in new york or boston its whether youre a hotel or a multiuse facility in real estate so its definitely more sector driven and i will remind folks its interesting and i have to mention bill wrangs name on every earnings call i think thats a trend but he was never one to dive into new york city weve got significant real estate exposure in new jersey and down into philadelphia and then up into boston and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 connecticut but we dont have were not going to overweight in the metro areas if you will so we havent seen the kind of risk in new york multifamily or other areas so geographies havent really impacted us i will tell you anecdotally and i know mark you live in new canaan i think we have seen a precipitous increase in home values in northern westchester and fairfield county as evidenced by some of reo properties and other things so its been pretty spectacular the growth outside of the metro market which has stabilized and taken any risk we had had in terms of home prices in our core market kind of out but thats really the only geographic the thing that ive seen is a little bit of flight from metro and an impact on home prices and rents jason jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah no i think you mostly hit it i guess what i would say is initially right if you look at the deferrals that we got in our consumer book there was certainly a disproportionate amount in new york right early on new york wasnt doing so well but at this point you saw our consumer deferrals decline to under million and overall were feeling better about the portfolio i actually think theres been some benefit within our footprint because of the stronger relative numbers at this point so the portfolio is like business banking midmarket right and a good portion of commercial real estate i think have also benefit from that throughout this period mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co and then the last question i had i know john you said its a little early to talk about renewal season but im not sure if chads on the line if he could give any color on sort of what hes seeing how the pipeline is shaping up and also maybe help us think through any potential ramifications on the hsa business in the event that we do see a blue wave john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp great questions mark ill take the blue wave question and then chad can give the rest weve been studying a lot spending a lot of time with the lobbyists in washington and we really do feel good and we can say with confidence that even in the cares act there were discussions about how we could leverage the hsa account product to help and so i think there is kind of bipartisan support for hsa going forward as a really good tool to allow people to kind of deal with healthcare costs and even have an hsa as part of a medicare program at some point so our view right now is that with respect to the still low probability of a complete replacement of our private insurance system with a single payer program and a lot of the talk thats going on that could benefit hsas we feel like politically were in pretty good shape regardless of what the outcomes of the november election are chad maybe you can provide some guidance and details on what youre seeing as you head into the january period charles l wilkins a executive vice president headhsa bank webster financial corp yeah thanks john thanks mark i agree with john your comments on the political environment i think under obamacare hsas were largely there was very limited impact and we grew quite a bit during that administration so i think its more likely were going to have a positive impact than negative with regard to sales results were really happy with what were seeing at this point in the year for ph oneone particularly in the large employer direct space and weve had large employer wins and our pipeline webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 in the closed contracting section of the pipeline is more than two times what it was at this point last year so were really happy with the results that were seeing in the area where i think everybody on this call know weve been investing in sales marketing and product capabilities to drive these kind of results in the channels that we can influence directly and so were happy to see those results that said i want people to keep in mind that of our accounts come from existing employers and you heard john mentioned that due to the pandemic and a weaker labor market weve seen about decrease in enrollments theyve come back somewhat here at the end of the third quarter but were still not seeing a strong enrollments yet from our large employers or our existing employers we expect that to come back as the economy rebounds but while were under indiscernible stress thatll be subdued also a couple of our large health plan providers are under a bit of pressure and we dont have as much visibility into that segment so its hard to call the ball for ph oneone but in the areas where we have visibility and we can impact it directly we like what were seeing mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks a lot mark operator our next question is from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please proceed david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks good morning john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey good morning david david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc i had a follow up first on credit looking on slide how the percent of the portfolio that is in deferral for leveraged loans and middle market at for each are the two highest i was curious when push comes to shove will sponsor step up in the leveraged portfolio to support their investments and the equity they have in these deals john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp david ill provide some overview and then ill turn it over to jason its always hard right to make really strong statements with conviction thats one of the reasons were in this business and we just recently had a situation where a 20year sponsor relationship they went above and beyond to make sure that the bank was taken care of and we were in this business as you know through the great recession webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 so my comment is that we believe that we are careful to select the sponsors who we do business with we go deep with sponsors with expertise and build relationships and so we have a track record of when the going gets tough both parties come together and figure out a solution so my answer is yes there are times where a sponsor cant put good money after bad if theres something fundamentally flawed with the business but if your risk selection is good upfront and you partner with the right sponsors that is a wonderful secondary tertiary support function so the other thing i will add and ive said it before is that the way to look at it is pretty simple if a sponsor has purchased a business in a sector where they feel like theres real value real growth opportunity and ability to create growth the pandemic which is a temporary delay right theres really not that many paradigm shifts maybe therell be a paradigm shift in commercial real estate and other areas down the road you really have to figure if were lending money appropriately at reasonable leverage levels meaning that theres significant cash equity usually and generally much more than the actual debt on the company that the borrower is not going to hand you the keys when theyre trying to protect a significant amount of investment and they know that the issues are only temporary so unless the business has some sort of fatal flaw theyre going to ride through this with us were going to provide them some sort of deferrals of payments or covenant relief but theyre going to put an additional cash equity and support the company to make sure at the other side of this temporary issue that we have not a permanent one that they can reach their potential with their company and get a return on their investment so longwinded way but you know that ive thought about this a lot and weve seen it be a benefit to our credit performance through the great recession and early on in the pandemic jason is there anything you want to add to that jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah no ill give a little bit more specifics right so ill talk about sponsor and leverage together the majority of the modifications have been in fact nonpaymentrelated payments down to about on a combined basis and sponsors in a lot of cases have been supportive and about a third of what ill call the more major modifications that weve done in the portfolio theres been some level of support provided by the sponsor either cash equity subdebt or guarantee a portion of the debt and that includes in the restaurant space where weve modified a handful of loans about of those there has been doubledigit equity thats come into these deals or subdebt so ive been very pleased overall with the performance of the portfolio during this time period and the support from the sponsors david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great color thanks for that and then a followup on the loan growth outlook so i wanted to reconcile a couple of comments that you made on the one hand you mentioned about the fourth quarter expect stable loan balances and you mentioned about how loan demand is muted but earlier in the call you mentioned about how pipelines are solid and one of the initiatives as we look out to next years to accelerate commercial loan growth so i was curious is it more of a timing thing that the solid pipeline should lead to an acceleration in loan growth next year and that the near term clearly sounds like its flat or just curious as to what your thoughts are there webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp david another really smart question and its tough we may never answer questions even prepandemic about this kind of what ive said is we really have confidence that the personal loan side in terms of mortgage and others are very theres some seasonality to it obviously and then theres also interest rates impact demand refinance activity when we talk about commercial banking and business banking weve demonstrated over a seven or eightyear period of time this ability to grow loans doubledigit but weve had quarters that are show less growth maybe seasonality maybe disproportionate amount of pay downs obviously right now were not confident in the doubledigit growth environment theres just not the economic backdrop and the loan demand there but again quarterly its going to be interesting we do have a lot of a big mortgage pipeline our commercial pipeline is solid its not what it was the last year at this time but its better than the last two quarters ill give you a couple dynamics if youre thinking short term we do think that there could be some more high originations in the fourth quarter and additional payoffs particularly if sponsors in real estate or ci are looking to do transactions before the end of the year if theyre concerned about retroactive tax moves by a new government in terms of what might impact so we do think the fourth quarter has the potential of being a little bit better from a loan growth perspective but again it may be just better originations and higher payoffs which lead to the same level of modest loan growth we are in the early stages of rolling out some new sponsor and specialty industry verticals and middle market industry verticals and again well talk more about that in january in earnest but thatll take a while to ramp up so i wouldnt think and you know us as risk managers this isnt the time to be going all in in a new sector so youll see us start to grow those sectors smartly over the course of and into so i think you have to think about originations you have to think about whether or not therell be higher prepayments and whether there are seasonal reasons or political reasons why you might see increased activity and then what i would say is we think we can outperform the market with respect to loan growth which will be somewhat muted so i hope that it may sound inconsistent but im trying to sort of be thoughtful about the short term and the long term and i think the best thing to say is we know weve got a track record of being able to grow commercial loans at the top in the top decile or top quartile of the market david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful thanks very much john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thanks david operator our next question is from jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 hi good morning maybe just circling back on the credit question should we think that as some of those potential npl formations or charges jason you talked about coming later in the next few quarters come through should we see the ph allowances of ratio then start to come down are we fully provided for future charge offs or would we likely see chargeoffs being covered somewhat by provision or can we expect to see that ratio the ph all ratio start to trickle down john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hey jared ill take a quick shot and then give it to jason just from a high level obviously we feel really good that weve got all of our identified loss content captured in what is an above market level provision so i think if you if we end up performing at our base case of credit outcome which as jason mentioned we do think well see some weakness then i think the industry generally feels on the lag basis we could see some cracks in credit in first q and we feel like we are covered for our base case and obviously if the dynamics change or as glenn said the path of the virus indicates a longer duration of economic uncertainty then that could impact the provisioning going forward jason jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp yeah i think you guys hit all the right points and i guess if i look at the situation right now there are some accounts that i do expect will could worsen right depending on the length of recovery and overall liquidity to borrow but im also really cautiously optimistic that there are a lot of borrowers that will improve so when i look at it on a netnet basis putting some of the other factors aside i dont feel like there will be as much pressure from a reserving standpoint and i do feel that were well covered i know were sort of near the top of our peers and so i feel good about where that lies so of course as i said its going to depend on the path of the virus what the new stimulus assuming its approved looks like and where its targeted and the big thing that i know weve also mentioned is consumer behavior right some of these things like movie theaters entertainment venues other things like that it just could be a much longer return over time but at the moment i feel really good about where were reserved i think theres likely to be less pressure and im cautiously optimistic jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah thats great color thanks and then youre talking about the potential for higher originations offset by the payoffs in fourth quarter when youre looking at new loan originations right now can you comment on what youre seeing in terms of pricing or spreads or structure are you able to put on is that incremental loan thats coming on in a better position for the bank overall whether you look at pricing or structure john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah another great question jared i think the short answer is yes right now i dont know how long that duration will go i get writeups from the business line leaders in the line of businesses within commercial and community and they all talk about the marketplace and i did see sort of saying that in this quarter and if we look at the numbers we have had better credit spreads for same risk rating but theyve talked about competition coming a little bit back into the market and people getting a little more aggressive again so i dont know how long itll last but i will tell you that from a pure statistical perspective it looks like we got paid more for taking the same risk or lower risk in structure in the third quarter webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 and again our spread and our yield is dependent not only on that variable what were able to do in terms of pricing risk but also on the mix and so we had pretty solid in our sponsor and specialty particularly in technology pretty terrific yield with good structures weve got such a fantastic team there and theres not as much competition from the nonbanks right now so i think that helped us from a pricing and structure perspective we also as i mentioned onboarded a lot of kind of government and institutional loans which have significantly lower yields but really high in kind of investment grade like credit metrics so the short answer is mix matters for us but the short answer to your question is i think for a period of time weve been able to get better structures at better pricing but i dont know how long thatll last depending again on the variability of the economy jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just finally for me switching to capital youre seeing good growth in ratios tce this quarter and then with the expected run off in ppp that should most likely just still get better how are you thinking about capital management as you head into maybe say head into are buybacks attractive as part of that strategy should we be thinking about the dividend or is it still too early to say given the broader uncertainty john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think its you kind of characterized at the end its too early to say in terms of making the call but i think youve hit it we obviously because of the economic headwinds all of the sudden our payout ratio went higher than our range but were really confident about our ability to maintain our dividend at its current level and so we think were going to grow back into that from an earnings perspective and be right in that to range which has been our long term target and we have grown our capital levels we think its prudent right now and we do think where we sit that its a little bit premature for a number of reasons to engage in repurchasing our stock we started to in january we kept talking about supporting loan growth and looking at strategic inorganic opportunities in hsa and thats why we were sort of delaying we began we thought the prudent thing to do obviously when the pandemic hit was to not repurchase shares i think when we feel like the coast is clear given our capital levels that will be back on the table jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp thank you operator our next question is from matthew breese with stephens incorporated please proceed matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp matt terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp hey matt did we lose you matt john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp yeah i think we lost him terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp operator can we give matt a minute to dial back in operator of course operator instructions john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp if need be we can follow up with matt terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp okay jason soto a executive vice president chief credit officer webster financial corp okay john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp hes back operator matt is back on please proceed matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey guys can you hear me now john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp we can matt and we promise we did not hit the dump button webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i believe you john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp how are you matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp okay good matthew breese q analyst stephens inc just thinking about the to expense save number thats a net number im just curious whats the gross number so we get a good idea of the dollars being reinvested into the other programs glenn i macinnes a executive vice president chief financial officer webster financial corp that is the to is off our base and so that is the number right its not it is if you look at our run rate and look at our core expenses you would expect its going to go down to that includes reinvestment and all those other john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp correct so it is the net number and what youre saying is at some level above that not materially right now weve got the ability weve invested heavily in a lot of digital automation business process tools and so were leveraging a lot of prior investments to continue to get efficiencies so were not announcing simultaneously a significant investment in goforward technology so that gross number is not twice the net number matt its that includes as glenn said the money that we have to reinvest to get everything out of the program matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then just framing the loan growth initiatives a little bit more does it include any material mix shifts in the composition of the loan book right now i think you mentioned some of the specialty areas youre in the sponsor and specialty books should we expect some outsized growth in those areas relative to others and does it also include any sort of geographic expansion should we expect you to break out of your core northeast footprint john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 yeah its great thank you weve been pretty deliberate over time and i always tell the story of coming here in stamford was the stamford connecticut was the great western frontier and weve since moved to providence and boston and white plains in new york and philadelphia and washington dc you have noticed that we have not made a big geographic move over the last handful of years largely because of the competitive dynamics and most recently obviously just kind of the economic landscape when we think about commercial we think about doing things we do well which weve been able to sort of replicate geographic expansion so in our current plans i dont think youd see us move into a market at the tail end of a pandemic because you end up being the lender of last resort and there may be some risk choices there i wouldnt take geographic expansion off the table if you look forward three or five years i think its something we have a core competency in but we also think in terms of what weve been able to slowly and smartly and deliberately add new industry verticals by hiring really talented bankers and so were looking to kind of expand our healthcare practice were looking to do more in spaces where we can gather deposits as well as use our balance sheet and make loans so i think well talk to you a little bit about it more in january but the reality is were thinking like youre thinking which is were not going to bet the bank on going into new geographies or new areas where we dont have deep expertise and even if we do and were kind of instituting a different risk profile its certainly not going to outgrow the stuff were doing that we know well so i think thats what youre wanting to hear i think thats the answer to your question is that youre not going to see us make big risk choices or go into new industries that are going to meaningfully impact either our credit performance or our growth in the short term well dabble well move forward in areas where we think theres protectable predictable recurring cash flows and well grow those businesses slowly or well move into new geographies and well grow them slowly to make sure that we dont make bad risk choices matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood and then maybe just tying this discussion into ma theres a bit more willingness here at least it sounds like to do or think about whole bank ma as you think about potential geographic expansion over the next three to five years could you acquire into those markets what would those markets look like what markets do you like and then maybe financially speaking could you give us some parameters on deals that would make sense to you john r ciulla a chairman president and chief executive officer webster financial corp way too premature matt and i was careful to say that as we said weve been evolving our view and we think that therell be more ma in the midcap space right now were focused on making sure that were maximizing our potential and putting us in a position where if thats on the top five of our priority list as you look forward a year from now we will be able to make those choices and make those decisions that youre referring to right now but way too premature matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay just last one for me webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 terrence k mangan a senior vice presidentinvestor relations webster financial corp ph we need to end the call matt go ahead
