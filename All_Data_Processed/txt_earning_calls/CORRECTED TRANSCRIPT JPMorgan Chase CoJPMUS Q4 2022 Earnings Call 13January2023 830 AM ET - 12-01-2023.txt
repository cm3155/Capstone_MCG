management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases fourth quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you very much good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of this quarter we had two significant items in corporate a million gain on the sale of visa b shares offset by million of net investment securities losses touching on a few highlights combined credit and debit spend is up yearonyear with growth in both discretionary and nondiscretionary spending we ended the year ranked for global ib fees with a wallet share of and credit continues to normalize but actual performance remains strong across the company on page we have more on our fourth quarter results revenue of billion was up billion or year onyear nii ex markets was up billion or driven by higher rates nir ex markets was down billion or predominantly driven by lower ib fees as well as management and performance fees in awm lower auto lease income and home lending production revenue and markets revenue was up million or yearon year expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments and credit costs of billion included net chargeoffs of million the net reserve build of billion was driven by updates to the firms macroeconomic outlook which now reflects a mild recession in the central case as well as loan growth in card services partially offset by a reduction in pandemicrelated uncertainty looking at the full year results on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and record revenue of billion and we delivered an rotce of onto balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of up basis points primarily driven by the benefit of net income including the sale of visa b shares less distributions aoci gains and lower rwa rwa declined approximately billion quarteronquarter reflecting lower rwa in the markets business which was partially offset by an increase in lending primarily in card services recall that we had a cet1 target for the first quarter of which we have now reached one quarter early so given that we expect to resume share repurchases this quarter jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 now lets go to our businesses starting on page starting with a quick update on the health of us consumers and small businesses based on our data they are generally on solid footing although sentiment for both reflects recessionary concerns not yet fully reflected in our data combined debit and credit spend is up yearonyear both discretionary and nondiscretionary spend are up yearonyear the strongest growth in discretionary being travel retail spend is up on the back of a particularly strong fourth quarter last year ecommerce spend was up while inperson spend was roughly flat cash buffers for both consumers and small businesses continue to slowly normalize with lower income segments and smaller businesses normalizing faster consumer cash buffers for the lower income segments are expected to be back to prepandemic levels by the third quarter this year now moving to financial results this quarter ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was up yearonyear youll notice in our presentation that we renamed consumer business banking to banking wealth management starting there revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates deposits were down quarteronquarter as spend remains strong and the rate cycle plays out with outflows being partially offset by new relationships client investment assets were down yearonyear driven by market performance partially offset by net inflows where we are seeing good momentum including from our deposit customer home lending revenue was down yearonyear largely driven by lower production revenue moving to card services auto revenue was up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up total revolving balances were up and we are now back to prepandemic levels however revolving balances per account are still below prepandemic levels which should be a tailwind in and in auto originations were billion down expenses of billion were up yearonyear primarily driven by investments as well as higher compensation largely offset by auto lease depreciation from lower volumes in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion reflecting reserve builds of million in card and million in home lending and net chargeoffs of million up million yearonyear next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion for the fourth quarter investment banking revenue of billion was down yearonyear ib fees were down in line with the market in advisory fees were down reflecting lower announced activity earlier in the year our underwriting businesses were affected by market conditions resulting in fees down for debt and down for equity in terms of the outlook the dynamics remain the same pipeline is relatively robust but conversion is very sensitive to market conditions and sentiment about the economic outlook also note that it will be a difficult compare against last years first quarter moving to markets revenue was billion up yearonyear driven by the strength in our macro franchise fixed income was up as elevated volatility drove strong client activity particularly in rates and currencies emerging markets while securitized products continue to be challenged by the market environment equity markets was relatively flat against a strong fourth quarter last year jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 payments revenue was billion up yearonyear excluding the net impact of equity investments it was up and the yearonyear growth was driven by higher rates securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher rates largely offset by lower deposits and market levels expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by the timing of revenuerelated compensation on a fullyear basis expenses of billion were up yearonyear primarily driven by higher structural expense and investments partially offset by lower revenuerelated compensation moving to the commercial bank on page commercial banking reported net income of billion record revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins partially offset by lower investment banking revenue and depositrelated fees gross investment banking revenue of million was down yearonyear driven by reduced capital markets activity expenses of billion were up year onyear deposits were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter primarily reflecting attrition of nonoperating deposits loans were up yearonyear and sequentially ci loans were up quarteronquarter reflecting continued strength in originations and revolver utilization cre loans were up quarteronquarter reflecting a slower pace of growth from earlier in the year due to higher rates which impacts both originations and prepayment activity then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances predominantly offset by reductions in management performance and placement fees linked to this years market declines expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by growth in our private banking advisor teams largely offset by lower performancerelated compensation for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion positive across equities and fixed income and billion for the full year and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion for the quarter and net outflows of billion for the full year aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion were down and yearonyear respectively driven by lower market levels finally loans were down quarteronquarter driven by lower securitiesbased lending while deposits were down sequentially driven by the rising rate environment resulting in migration to investments and other cash alternatives turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net gain of million revenue of billion was up billion yearonyear nii was billion up billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates nir was a loss of million and reflects the two significant items i mentioned earlier and expenses of million were up million yearonyear with that lets pivot to the outlook for which i will cover over the next few pages starting with nii on page okay we expect total nii to be approximately billion and nii ex markets to be approximately billion on the page we show how the significant increases in quarterly nii throughout culminated in the billion run rate for the fourth quarter and how we expect that to evolve for going through the drivers the outlook assumes that rates follow the forward curve the combination of the annualization of the hike in late december the hikes expected early in the year and the cuts expected later in the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 year should be a net tailwind offsetting that tailwind is the impact of deposit repricing which includes our best guess of rate paid in both wholesale and consumer in addition looking at balance sheet growth and mix we expect solid overall card spend growth as well as further normalization of revolving balances per account and modest loan growth across the rest of the company we expect that this tailwind will be offset by lower deposit balances given modest attrition in both consumer and wholesale but its very important to note that this nii outlook is particularly uncertain specifically fed funds could deviate from forwards balance attrition and migration assumptions could be meaningfully different and deposit product and pricing decisions will be determined by customer behavior and competitive dynamics as we focus on maintaining and growing primary bank relationships and may be quite different from what this outlook assumes and further the timing of all these factors could significantly affect the sequential trajectory of nii throughout the year that said as we continue executing our strategy of investing to acquire new customers as well as deepen relationships with existing ones and as we see the impact of loan growth we would expect sequential nii growth to return all else being equal and just to finish up on nii as the guidance indicates we expect markets nii for the year to be slightly negative as a result of higher rates but remember this is offset in markets nir now turning to expenses on page we expect adjusted expense to be about billion which includes approximately million from the higher fdic assessment going through some of the other drivers we expect increases from labor inflation which while it seems to be abating on a forwardlooking basis is effectively in the run rate for an additional laborrelated driver is the annualization of head count growth as well as our plans for more modest head count increases this year all of which are primarily in connection with executing our investments and on investments while we are continuing to invest consistent with what we told you at investor day its a more modest increase than last year the themes remain consistent and we will continue to give you more detail throughout the year including at investor day in may of course as is always true this outlook includes continuing to generate efficiencies across the company and finally while volume and revenuerelated expense was ultimately a tailwind for we are expecting it to be close to flat in which will be completely market dependent as always moving to credit on page on the page you can see how exceptionally benign the credit environment was in for the company across wholesale card and the rest of consumer turning to the outlook for card net chargeoff rates specifically marianne gave quite a bit of detail about this at a recent conference and our outlook hasnt really changed so to recap that story the entry to delinquency rate is the leading indicator of future chargeoffs and it is currently around of prepandemic levels we expect that to normalize around the middle of the year with the associated chargeoffs following about six months later as a result loss rates in will still be normalizing so while we anticipate exiting the year around normalized levels we expect the card net chargeoff rate to be approximately up from the historically low rate of basis points in but still well below fully normalized levels so lets turn to page for a brief wrap up before going to qa were very proud of the results producing an rotce and a record revenue in what was a quite dynamic environment throughout my discussion of the outlook ive emphasized the uncertainty in many of the key drivers of results and while we are ready for jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 a range of scenarios our expectation is for another strong performance so as we look forward we expect to continue to produce strong returns in the near term and we remain confident in our ability to deliver on our throughthecycle target of rotce and with that operator lets open up the line for qa question and answer section operator please stand by audio gap coming from the line of john mcdonald from autonomous research you may proceed john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning jeremy i wanted to ask about the nii outlook slide the range of outcomes on deposit costs is quite wide as you mentioned it looks like to demonstrated there does the billion nii line up with kind of the midpoint of that maybe you could give some color about kind of the drivers of the billion and where that lines up on this range of deposit cost outcomes jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure john i mean i wouldnt take the chart on the bottom left too literally thats just supposed to give a stylized indication of the fact that relatively small changes in deposit rate paid for the company on average as you well know can produce quite significant impacts on the nii and also that theres as weve already talked about a meaningful audio gap the outlook is our best guess as jamie says and the drivers within that are the usual drivers in wholesale we would expect to see a little bit of continued attrition especially of the nonoperating type balances and youre going to see some internal migration there out of noninterestbearing into interestbearing over time in consumer cds are flowing right now and were seeing good new cd production weve got a cd in the market as of this morning and so continued cd production and internal migration there will be a driver and the rest of it is well and of course as i said in the prepared remarks we do expect across the company modest deposit attrition as we look forward as a function of qt and the rate cycle and so on so weve got best guesses for all of those in the outlook and of course the actual outcome will be different in one way or another and well just run the business this year john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and on buybacks how will you think about approaching buybacks and putting it in that mix of capital decisions that you have and any thoughts on kind of the size or quantifying the potential buybacks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so sort of in the mode of like helping you guys out to put a number in the model if you sort of look at the way were seeing things obviously weve got another gsib step coming next year so say a target jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 and the sort of using your estimates organic capital generation minus dividends et cetera and all of the elements of uncertainty there i think a good number to use is something like billion of buybacks for this year for but you know of course that buybacks are always at the end of our capital hierarchy so if we have better uses for the money those will come first and the timing and the conditions of how much we do when is entirely at our discretion and also noting that we are potentially going to see a basel iii npr sometime in the first quarter or maybe in the second quarter and while that will be an npr and it will only cover part of the surface area and it wont be final so its unlikely that it meaningfully shapes shortterm decisionmaking there will be some information content of that release that could shape our decisions as well john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning jeremy my first question is just as you can imagine following up on the nii line of questioning appreciate that there is a significant amount of uncertainty in this years nii forecast in particular but to follow up with johns question im wondering if you could give us sort of more specific guardrails with regards to what youre expecting for deposit attrition and deposit beta in terms of the terminal deposit beta i think the feedback im getting very early from investors is that they appreciate the headwinds thats occurring for nii this year at the same time you have been consistently beating what seemed like conservative nii expectations for including printing a giant billion number in the fourth quarter so thats why i think the more specific guardrails could be very helpful as investors try to figure out what their own expectations are versus that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks erika so look i totally appreciate the desire for more specific guardrails i would want that too if i were you i do think that were trying to be quite helpful by giving you a full year number which if were honest involves a lot of guessing about how things will evolve throughout the year i think once you start giving guardrails you implicitly assume that outcomes outside of the guardrails are very unlikely and thats just a level of precision that were just not prepared to get into especially because in the end as i said a lot of the repricing decisions that well be faced with as a company are respond to data in the moment at a granular level in connection with a strategy which is about growing and maintaining primary bank relationships rather than chasing every dollar of balances at any cost so in that context we do expect modest balance attrition across the company for deposits as i said jamie you want to add something jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co erika i just want to give a big picture about why i do not consider billion conservative so the federal reserve reduced its balance sheet by billion trillion came out of bank deposits and so investors can jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 invest in tbills money market funds and of course banks are competing for the capital money now and banks are all in a different place and some banks have started to compete heavily some have a lot of excess cash and maybe compete less but if you look at prior and forget what happened in i think people make a huge mistake looking at that weve never had zero rates weve never had rates go up this fast so i expect there will be more migration to cds more migration to money market funds a lot of people are there competing for it and were going to have to change savings rates we can do it at our own pace and look at what other people are doing we dont know the timing but it will happen and i just also want to point out that even at billion were earning quite good returns weve always pointed out to you all that sometimes were overearning and sometimes were underearning i would say okay this time were overearning on nii this quarter were maybe overearning on credit we may be underearning on something else so these are still very good numbers and were going to wait and see and well report to you but i dont want to give you false notions how secure it is erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and my followup is exactly in that line of questioning lets zoom out for a second here to your point jamie the returns are still good you mentioned that your outlook already captures a mild recession and im going to reask the question i asked in the third quarter as you think about do you think jpmorgan can hit that rotce that you laid out in investor day even with the headwind in nii and the headwind in the provision jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes we can but a lot of factors determine that but yes we can i think when we do investor day in may we may give you a more interesting number which is what do we think our rotce will be if we have a real recession which i think even in a real recession it would probably equal the average industrial company which is good so were going to give you some detail around that and those are still good returns and we can still grow and remember is very good if you can compound some growth at those are extraordinary numbers and i also want to point out we dont know exactly what capital needs to be at this point and we have to modify that at one point jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and erika let me just add a very minor clarifying point i just want to be crystal clear about this so as you know and as we discussed a lot through the pandemic in terms of the way we construct and build the allowance while its anchored around our economist central case forecast which as you correctly say is a mild recession through the way we weight the different scenarios and a range of other factors the de facto scenario thats embedded in the forecast is actually more conservative than that from an allowance perspective so we just want to be clear about that erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc perfect thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 operator the next question is coming from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i guess maybe jeremy just following up on the credit assumptions underlying if you could give us a sense of whats assumed in that reserve ratio at the end of the year be it in terms of the unemployment rate and your outlook around just a lot of chatter around commercial real estate the struggles to reprice in the current rate backdrop are you concerned about that are you seeing pain points in cre customers given whats happening with cap rates and then just overall backlog today jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure let me just do cre quickly ebrahim as you know our sort of multifamily commercial term lending business is really quite different from the classic officetype business our office portfolio is very small class a best developers best locations so the vast majority of the loan balances in commercial real estate are that sort of affordable multifamily housing commercial term lending stuff which is really quite secure from a credit perspective for a variety of reasons so we feel quite comfortable with the loss profile of that business and so then you were asking about the assumptions in credit overall so as i said the central case economic forecast has a mild recession and if i remember correctly unemployment peaking at something like the adjustments that we make to the scenarios to reflect slightly more conservative outlook have us imply a peak unemployment thats notably higher than that so i think we have appropriately conservative assumptions about the outlook embedded in our current balances and the trajectory that weve talked about in the presentation they definitely can capture something more than a very mild soft landing but of course it wouldnt be appropriate to reflect a fullblown hard landing in our current numbers since the probability of that is clearly well below ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch noted and i guess just as a followup youve managed rwa growth pretty well when you look at loan growth yearoveryear versus rwa stayed relatively flat as we think about just managing capital how should we think about the evolution of rwa are there still opportunities to optimize that going into whatever the fed comes out with on basel thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so there are definitely still opportunities to optimize were continuing to work very hard and its a big area of focus some of that is reflected in this quarters numbers but some of the other drivers of this quarter are what you might call more passive items particularly in market risk rwa and yeah but we should be clear that although weve said that the effects of capital optimization are not a material economic headwind for the company theyre also not zero there are real consequences due to the choices that were making as a result of this capital environment and in a basel iii outcome that is unreasonably punitive from a capital perspective there will be additional consequences that we obviously are hoping thats not the case and believe that its not appropriate but well see what happens jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch noted thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi you may proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you im curious i want to talk leveraged loans for a second youve done a good job avoiding some of these putting on these loans sort of like the better half of the last half year so good call on your part things have gotten a lot cheaper however bank balance sheets not yours are still kind of muckyed up with a lot of the back book im curious to see if things have gotten cheap enough do you consider yourself back in and how important is this in general for activity levels to pick back up to have available funding from the big banks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah a couple things there glenn so short answer is were absolutely open for business there terms are better pricing is better we have the resources needed were fully there no overhang no issue also i think theres a bit of a narrative that like activity in the market needs to overcome overhang were not convinced that thats true we think that the overhang is in the numbers and people need to look forward and the system has the capacity to handle the risks so i recognize your point i think its an interesting point but we are wide open for business and not particularly concerned about the overhang from the perspective of banks ability to finance activity glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi interesting so maybe a bidask thing more so okay maybe jamie while we have you in the last annual letter you talked about low competitive moats and intense competition from all angles not just fintech and i was just trying to think out loud is that better or worse that competitive landscape in a much higher rate backdrop maybe ill just leave it at that to see where you go with it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no i think its the same you have the apples who are basically doing a lot of banking services and walmart starting theirs and obviously higher rates will hurt some of the folks in the fintech world and maybe even help some of the folks so we expect tough competition going forward glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay thanks operator the next question is coming from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets you may proceed jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc jeremy you mentioned in your payments business that if you took out the equity investment writedowns the growth was over can you share with us on the equity writedowns obviously private equity is going through some challenging times and im assuming jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co it was a gain last year it wasnt a writedown this year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc oh i got it okay i thought there was a writedown there okay jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i want to make that clear sorry about that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you jamie sticking just with private equity for a moment can you share with us where the risks are in the private equity markets to jpmorgan when you think about it from your loan book or is it really just in equity investments and maybe expand upon that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sorry do you want me to take that gerard so just a couple of things so jamie is right the headwind yearon year is primarily a function of the fact that this is an investment that just because of the management alternative accounting standard we were forced to mark up previously this is an investment that we got payment in kind as part of the sale of some of our internally developed initiatives so anyway its fine the point is there is a small writedown this quarter and the important point there is that the core business is performing exceptionally well both because of higher rates but also because of the strategy that takis talked a lot at investor day paying off across fees and valueadded services and so on and so forth and i guess gerard your question is like private equity in general and how are we feeling about that space did i hear that correctly jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thats correct jeremy and just in terms of any lending obviously so many of these companies have seen their valuations come down considerably is there any elevated risk lending to some of these companies considering the struggles theyre having jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i think thats a risk that we manage quite tightly as a company our exposures to the sort of non bank financial sector broadly defined and of course as we thought a little bit about what normalized wholesale chargeoffs could look like through the cycle theyre obviously higher than effectively zero which is what we have now but we feel confident with our credit discipline and what we have on the books gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then as a followup question you guys did a good job building up that loan loss reserve this quarter two questions to that first the shared national credit exam results are always released in february does the reserve buildup take some of that into account and second how much of the reserve build was more of a management overlay versus your base case the quantitative part of the decision making for building up the reserve jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean ill give you that answer but im oversimplifying a lot i would say that jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oversimplifying jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah yeah no i got it the sort of conservatism of the management overlay did not change for all intents and purposes quarteronquarter i think thats the best way to think about that gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc oh and the shared national yeah go ahead jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the national shared credit sic shared national credit thing will not affect our results materially gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you jamie jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 operator the next question is coming from the line of ken usdin from jefferies you may proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hi thanks good morning just wondering if you can help us understand the ongoing efforts on your mitigation for the rwas in advance of all the points youve made already about the pending capital regime can you help us understand what type of effects that has if any on parts of the income statement whether its nii or the trading business jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so if i just take that one just assume were going to have modest growth in rwa and in every single businesses mortgages loans derivatives how we hedge cva and stuff like that we take actions to manage rwa it does not really affect the business that much it might one day but it doesnt affect it today and so we dont build in somehow we lose a little bit of this a little bit of that and the biggest opportunity down the road would be a reopening of the securitization markets theyre still very tight and i think one day they will reopen ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then on the one followup just coming back to the reserving process can you just help us understand relative to the peak in that you gave for your unemployment rate quarterly average and that average baseline where does this fourth quarter reserve get you to and just does that rule of thumb that you kind of gave us last quarter still stand in terms of scenario analysis on potential builds ahead of this mild recession jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah can i just make it real simple the base case okay is where it hits almost that unemployment then you probabilityweight other scenarios thats why jeremy is saying the reserve is higher than the base case we didnt change the probability scenario weighting but of course it got worse since the base case got worse thats all it is which still is a good benchmark for you all to keep in mind is if weve got to a relative adverse case call that a unemployment and then once you get there you assume the average weighting you have wings it could get better or it could get worse at that case we would need about billion more when the base case itself deteriorates were moving closer to relative adverse thats all it is these are all probabilities and possibilities and hypothetical numbers and if i were you id just look at chargeoffs like actual results and we break this out but its hard to describe and every bank does this slightly differently and every bank has a slightly different base case and a slightly different weighting of adverse cases et cetera and so were just trying to make it as simple as possible jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah i hear you the challenge this time is that were going to have the income statement effect way ahead of that chargeoff so were all trying to just fit for that but i appreciate that thanks jamie jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and once the mev base case get to where you expect relative adverse youll be adding the billion of reserves before you have chargeoffs ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc exactly right jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and again and maybe just out of interest implied in your question might be a little bit to what extent does this quarters build sort of is a down payment on the billion and the answer to that question is much less than all of it because a lot of it was driven by loan growth but since some of it as jamie says is driven by the flow through of the downward revision of the central case you could say subject to the caveat that this is a little bit art not science that theres some down payment on the billion ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes understood thank you for all that operator the next question is coming from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to understand a little bit about how youre thinking about managing the expense line as you go through this year i know we talked already about how its hard to predict nii obviously markets has pushes and pulls can you help us understand how youre thinking about delivering operating leverage where the elements of the expense base are needing to be invested in so you really cant touch and where there are opportunities to potentially peel back such that if you get a weaker rev line you can still deliver positive operating leverage jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so i mean as you know obviously we tend to break down our expenses across our three categories and in some sense the category that youre addressing is the volume and revenuerelated expense which we highlight because it should pretty symmetrically respond to a better or worse environment and thereby contribute to operating leverage so for example in this years ultimate outcome and the number that we wound up printing for the yearon year change in volume and revenuerelated expense were still refining the numbers well probably show you more at investor day but is probably close to billion in other words yearonyear decline whereas next year were assuming something more like flat so while the sort of yearonyear dollar change in the outlook sort of to to is comparable the mix is quite different actually and so for example if we wound up being wrong about the type of environment that were budgeting for you would expect a significant drop in the volume and revenuerelated expense number thats in the current outlook and that would contribute to operating leverage for the rest of it were always generating efficiency and weve worked just as hard at that whether the revenue environment is good or bad and as you know we invest through the cycle and so broadly our investment plans really shouldnt be that sensitive to shortterm changes in the environment of course certain types of things like marketing investments in the card business in particular the math of what we expect the npv of those things to be through the cycle may change in a downturn and that could produce lower investment all else equal but the core strategic investments that were making to secure the future of the company are not going to get modified because of the ups and downs of the environment betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and part of the reason for asking is one of the debate points on jpmorgans stock has been around the capital charges the capital margin will capital be a bigger burden for you to bear as we go through the next couple of years as you deliver on the positive operating leverage side it gives you room to absorb some more capital obviously and still hit those irr and rotce target on incremental investments maybe you could help us understand what level of capital increase you could absorb given the operating leverage youre expecting to generate and maybe thats an unfair question today and its a better question for investor day but thats kind of the debate thats out there on the stock jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i get it i get it i mean its a fair question its a good question im not going to answer it super specifically and jamie may have some views here too but let me just quickly say weve kind of said that we feel quite confident about this companys ability to generate through the cycle and thats incorporating our sense of the current environment the operating leverage that you talked about and the expectation of higher capital requirements with the target in the first quarter of the question of whether basel iii end game and other factors increase that number and how much of that we can absorb and still produce those returns is of course impossible to answer right now but i would remind you that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 its not just denominator expansion unreasonable capital outcomes will increase costs into the real economy which goes into the numerator too its not what we want but that is a possible outcome betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator the next question is coming from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi yeah i recognize youre evolving your business model and youre spending money to make more money and that your track record last decade was strong there but as it relates to the frank acquisition thats been in the news im just wondering what that says about the financial discipline for the deals that you pursued the billion of investing each year and the onefifth increase in expenses over three years to your guide of billion in so its really a question about financial discipline and i know you cant go into details on the frank deal and look you earn the purchase price in two days okay so i get that and if theres fraud you cant do anything about fraud but still it diverts management resources and attention so maybe just in the specifics as it relates to the acquisition strategy like who sources them who negotiates them who does the due diligence who runs it and ultimately who is accountable for all these different deals and when youre having investments going across business lines which is a strength of you guys but who is ultimately accountable when these investments dont go the way you want to and jamie you recognized a couple years ago at investor day you said look sometimes youre going to waste money as youre innovating and youre growing but ultimately who is accountable when an investment doesnt go right like the frank deal or another deal or some of the other billion that you expect to spend this year jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah obviously mike thats a very good question which were always concerned about because weve always talked about complacency and all things like that so obviously when youre getting up to bat times a year you are going to have errors and we dont want our company to be terrified of errors that we dont do anything and that the complacency is then burdened by bureaucracy which is stasis and death so you have to be very careful when you make an error like youre going to cripple the firm we are very disciplined and you see that in a lot of different ways you see it in our leverage lending book you see it in the success of our investments you see it in the quality of our products and services you see it in all these things and theres no difference for an acquisition there are so the acquisitions are done by the businesses but theres also a centralized team that does extensive due diligence so the business does it the centralized team does it weve been doing it for years wasnt like we just started doing something like that and obviously there are always lessons learned and at one point well tell you the lessons learned here when this thing is out of litigation but were quite comfortable and the people who are responsible are the people in the business so if that business did the acquisition they are responsible they report back and we expect people when they talk to all of us is the good jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 the bad the ugly were never looking for how great everything was and obviously this thing in one way or another was a huge mistake mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc let me follow up on that so that relates to the inorganic growth as it relates to the organic growth such as in the payments business which i know is a focus that cuts across a lot of different business lines so as you invest more in payments which can be a or pe business which could be great if you got there who is responsible for that sort of organic investment that cuts across sometimes the way you aggregate the data its consumer its to the investment bank it could be asset management it could be commercial it could be everything in the payments whos responsible for those jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so just to be clarified so i would say that marianne and jenn when it comes to credit debit checks and all the consumerrelated stuff and takis which i think you saw the presentation about payments at investor day reporting to daniel and that is on the wholesale payments merchant processing a whole bunch of stuff and those are direct responsibilities its quite clear this is an area that cuts across the company so theres a payments working group that just spends time on that that working group has not done an acquisition okay and if they want to invest which there are cases by the way and youll see more this year theyre decided jointly and all the way up to daniel and me mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last followup to my first start the general comment i mean this is the third year in a row of about billion of expense growth and you have slide there but i mean thats a lot of certain frontloaded expenses for less certain backended benefits hows your comfort level that youre going to see those backended benefits relative to the past jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co totally and we tried to show you guys at investor day for every branch we open for every banker we hire for every tech thing we do were pretty comfortable there are certain things more like infrastructure like getting to the cloud and stuff like that which you cant identify all of that but were pretty comfortable and if they werent working wed change them so we ask ourselves that question every day when youre adding wealth managers or branches or certain things and marketing is half of that not quite half but half of that number thats a very specific for the most part a very specific dollar in how many dollars out not a guess and were pretty accurate at that kind of stuff and again if theres billion that we were spending didnt give us the return we would cut the billion mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 operator the next question is coming from the line of steve chubak from wolfe research you may proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so wanted to start off with a question on the outlook for trading and the investment banking businesses just jeremy given the strong pipelines you cited was hoping you can provide some additional color just in terms of what youre hearing from corporate clients especially in the context of the mild recession scenario you outlined when you would expect to see some inflection in investment banking activity and similar question on the trading side youre facing difficult comps in the coming year we still have qt rate volatility proxy is still elevated do you anticipate a significant moderation in trading activity or not jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure thanks steve so lets do banking first so i think the thing thats interesting about banking right now is that the declines have been so significant obviously from very elevated levels but even relative to just was a relatively weak year and as we look into its possible that the actual economic environment will be worse than it was in so that could conceivably make you pessimistic about the investment banking wallet outlook and to be sure its not as if were super optimistic but its important to note that part of the issue here is how quickly things changed in specifically with respect to rates as that affects the debt business and valuations as it affects ma and ecm as well and one of the sort of necessary conditions for people to do deals or decide to raise capital is just getting comfortable with valuations in the open market so i think theres a chance that that actually winds up helping in in the investment banking wallet of course we dont know but those are some of the things that were thinking about similarly on the markets side obviously markets had another very strong year better than wed expected since the numbers were so strong coming out of the pandemic we were expecting more normalization than what we actually saw and had a lot of themes i think the active management community did well that always helps us a little bit and we had volatility with relatively orderly and continued markets as we look towards maybe some of those themes will be a little bit less obvious and that could be a little bit of a headwind but on the other hand its not like the volatility is going away and markets seem to continue to be quite orderly and a rate environment is probably one where theres more trading opportunities than a rate environment so of course we dont know well see i think you would have to probably expect some normalization there the numbers are really very strong in markets but well see well see what happens steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful color and just for my followup on finalization of basel iii sorry jeremy i couldnt help myself here but in barrs december speech he strongly hinted at capital requirements moving higher for you and peers you also alluded in your comments or in a response to one of the questions that the finalization of basel iii can potentially be very punitive given the absence of the proposal i was really just hoping you could speak to how youre scenario planning for the eventual finalization and any additional detail you can offer on the areas of mitigation i think the one issue or jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 area of confusion is that one of the biggest sources of rwa inflation is op risk which cant really be mitigated so what are the actions that you can take to really offset some of those potential headwinds jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so steve id love to get into a whole lot of detail here but i just think that the question of how to mitigate is really hard to discuss in a lot of detail until we see an actual proposal and the reason that we talk about potentially punitive increases of you studying this issue closely is just to point out that under the version of the world where you get the worst outcome in all of the different moving parts of this thing its a very significant increase to the capital requirements of the system as a whole and given how strong the system is today that just like doesnt make sense to us so we just want to say that but yeah jamie please jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i mean just look you guys know the operating risk capital and the trading book the ccar gsifi all those moving parts lets just see what they are well deal with them when we get there and then well figure out what we have to modify our business and stuff like that we dont think its necessary to increase capital ratios were quite clear on that one of the new numbers we put on the top of the press release was our total loss absorbing capacity so we have now almost billion i mean really like at one point when is billion of that of trillion liquidity are all those things enough but lets just see what it is theyre going to work it through there are international laws there are international requirements were hoping that america is the same as international that would be nice gsifi is supposed to be corrected well see if that happens so lets just see we dont have to guess and if the numbers too high were going to tell you what were going to do about it steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co steve just a very minor expansion of that just to expand a bit on jamies point its important to be clear there will be time to adjust like theres a long road from the npr that sort of supports jamies point lets see what it is and then well steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough thanks so much for taking my questions operator the next question is coming from the line of matthew oconnor from deutsche bank you may proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 good morning how are you guys thinking about managing the securities book given the outlook of lower deposits obviously the yield curve is quite inverted depending on what part youre looking at or most parts frankly and then at the same time the securities book is cash flowing a lot less than it was a couple years ago just given the rate environment jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes remember the securities book is an outcome of investing in basically excess deposits and you have like trillion deposits and trillion of loans and things like that and we manage it to manage interest rate exposure all these various things and then when you say the size of it we forecast which im not going to give you the numbers we forecast every quarter what were going to buy what were going to sell how much is coming in how much we need for liquidity and we adjust it all the time based upon deposits coming down and loans and stuff like that obviously what you get to invest in is at much higher rates today and you see jpmorgans loss in the htm loan book as a percent is much lower than most other people were kind of conservative there too matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i guess a bigger picture question weve seen such a drop in really 10year part of the curve and even further out and banks arent really buying instead theyre selling and i guess i was wondering if you had thoughts on whos buying and whats driving the rates so much lower than most people think they should be at jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah we do but you should read get the analyst reports to get that we look at what everybodys doing pension plans governments we look at every part of the curve we look what other banks are doing i think i already mentioned earlier in this call banks are in different positions some may have to sell securities to pay off their loan books we obviously dont so people are in a different position and as jeremy pointed out its very important that yield curve will not be the same six months from now as it is today while we use that to kind of look forward its not actually our forecast we know it will be wrong but the investment portfolio will be invested when there are opportunities we bought a lot of ginnie maes when there was a oas spread we sold one of the reasons we take securities losses is because that gives you 10plus billion dollars you can reinvest at what you think are more attractive securities matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you operator the final question is coming from the line of andrew lim from société générale you may proceed andrew lim q analyst société générale hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so the first one on credit quality thanks for giving us commentary on the shape of ncos i guess specifically for credit cards topping out at the end of this year could jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 you give us a bit more color on how reserve builds should shape out this year i guess with respect to cecl im guessing they should top out quite soon thats my first question jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay sure andrew lim q analyst société générale this is assuming all your macro assumptions are unchanged and so forth jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah andrew well i think weve talked about cecl quite a bit and i think theres some decent color there in terms of jamies billion over a few quarters in a world where the economic outlook is worse than it is today were definitely not going to get into the business of giving you an outlook for a sequential evolution of the loan loss allowance its appropriate today and it will evolve as a function of the environment andrew lim q analyst société générale sure okay lets drill down into nii then i just want to square a few comments you made there jeremy so if i heard you correctly i think you are sort of talking about sequential increases in nii so i guess looking towards like billion plus for maybe even so i guess were hitting about billion for and then a sharp dropoff as say deposit costs increase and maybe we get a few fed fund rate cuts as well is that the way we should be thinking about it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no so let me uncontroversially say no there andrew just for the avoidance of doubt so look my comments about sequential increases were to address the sort of obvious conclusion which youre somewhat correctly drawing from the slide which is that in a world where were exiting the fourth quarter run rate at billion and were telling our billion ex markets or whatever and were telling you billion for the full year there are obviously some sequential declines in there somewhere as a function of what plays out were simply saying dont project those into the future in perpetuity once things adjust we will return to normal sequential growth does that make sense andrew lim q analyst société générale right got you yeah no no no sure absolutely that makes sense thats great thanks for that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes thanks operator we have no additional questions in queue i would now like to hand the call back to mr barnum jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q4 earnings call 13jan2023 jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thats it thank you very much jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well thank you very much
