over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our asset quality and income statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic and good morning to all on the call turning to slide the asset quality of our portfolio remains strong during the second quarter we recorded net chargeoffs of million or basis points a modest increase from net chargeoffs of basis point in the first east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 quarter the increase primarily came from higher ci gross chargeoffs partially offset by higher recoveries quarteroverquarter criticized loans improved and the criticized loans ratio improved basis points nonperforming assets as of june increased modestly to basis points of total assets from basis points as of march reflecting loan growth our stable asset quality metrics and the current macroeconomic outlook we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the second quarter compared with million for the first quarter increasing the allowance for loan losses to million and now starting the discussion of our income statement on slide on this slide we detailed out specifics on the tax credit investments as the amortization and effective tax rate can fluctuate quarter over quarter reflecting the timing of when tax credit investments closed we currently anticipate that for the third quarter the amortization of tax credit investments will be approximately million and for the full year of the effective tax rate will be approximately turning to slide second quarter net interest income was million a decrease of from the first quarter net interest margin of compressed by basis points quarteroverquarter as you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide this was largely due to the impact of higher interestbearing deposit costs and the deposit mix shift partially offset by expanding asset yield turning to slide the second quarter average loan yield was an increase of basis points quarter overquarter as of june the spot coupon rate of our loans was compared with as of march in this slide we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio for the last five quarters in total of our loan portfolio was variable rate as of june including linked to prime rate and linked to sofr over the last several years while rates were low we continue to help many of our cre and ci customers to a lesser extent hedge against rising rates through the use of swaps caps and collars fixed rate and synthetically fixed rate loans are of the total cre book as of june these clients are protected against the rising debt service costs in a higher rate environment turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the second quarter was basis points up basis points from the first quarter our spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of june equivalent to a cumulative beta relative to the 500basispoint increase in the target fed funds rate since december in comparison the cumulative beta on our loans has been over the same time period moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the second quarter was million fee income was million reflecting growth across all fee income categories during the quarter for the second quarter other investment income of million was up million from the first quarter largely reflecting higher income from community reinvestment act investments moving to slide second quarter noninterest expense was million excluding the amortization of tax credits and cdi adjusted noninterest expense was million in the second quarter up a modest sequentially second quarter compensation and employee benefits expense was lower by million due to higher seasonal costs in the first quarter the second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the first quarter our adjusted pretax preprovision income was million in the second quarter and our pretax preprovision roa was industryleading east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and with that i will now review our updated outlook for the full year of on slide for the full year compared to our full year results we expect yearoveryear loan book in the range of to unchanged from the prior outlook yearoveryear net interest income growth in the range of to underpinning our net interest income assumptions is the forward interest rate curve as of june 30th which assumes one fed funds rate hike of basis points in october with a yearend fed funds target rate of adjusted noninterest expense growth in the range of to we expect our revenue and expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage yearoveryear in terms of credit for the full year of we currently expect to report a provision for credit losses in the range of million to million the provision for credit losses for will be largely driven by loan growth and changes in the macroeconomic outlook today asset quality is excellent and we believe the potential losses from any problem loans are limited and very manageable finally we expect that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately based on approximately million of tax credit investments excluding indiscernible investment and an estimated related tax credit amortization of million for the full year with that i will now turn the call back to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing we are pleased with our consistent financial performance and strong core earnings although net interest income decreased given the deposit competition our revenue and pretax preprovision profitability remained very strong the east west business model is resilient and diversified and our balance sheet is healthy we operate with high capital levels and we are wellpositioned to deliver earnings growth and strong profitability i will now open the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question will come from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america you may now go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess my first question irene for you on nii so it was a decent step down in the second quarter if i have it right your guidance implies that nii stabilizes about per quarter in the back half of the year one give us your assumptions around terminal deposit betas nib mix underpinning the nii guide and what leads nii to being at the lower end of your guide at versus irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question first of all when we look at where we stand today whats positive although with the deposit competition the cost of deposits did increase in the second quarter whats positive as we keep growing were bringing on new customer deposits and through that we have the opportunity to lay off some of these higher cost broker deposits that we placed on the balance sheet after the midmarch disruption and ill just share since june weve laid off about a little over million at and replace that with lower cost customer deposits so the momentum is here and that is one of the underpinning drivers for why we think nii will stabilize of course the expectation is that the fed will increase rates next week that will help a little bit on the yield side as well and indiscernible around the guidance i do think a lot of that is going to be how successful we are as i mentioned were positive and the momentum is there on the deposit side but how successful we are in growing those customer deposits over the course of the year and then of course also a little bit as far as the range of where well be on the loan growth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and where do you expect the nib balances to stabilize irene irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so right now my expectation is from the level that we were at at june it will decrease a little bit ill share that also quartertodate has been positive and were at as of yesterday east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc dda irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc dda im sorry yeah dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc so i mean just to clarify so as of june dda was i mean as of two days ago its now and just another perspective is that the spot rate for deposit as of june is and then as two days ago so we actually are maintaining the deposit rate pretty steady and quite frankly if you look at even well if we reflect back even in may and june the deposit rate relatively was very stable around closer to and the fact is it was just the silicon valley bank and situation in large which caused a spike in april and to a certain extent we try and do it on our own too because we want to be extraordinarily cautious and prudent and we did not need that much deposit to come in we have very good loan to deposit ratio we could have just let some of the deposit outflow and not worrying about showing up deposit but we did we actually brought in broker deposits and so forth so once we saw it stabilize after april so we now decided that we can just ease it up because the momentum of new customer deposit existing customer deposit and whatnot all together give us some confidence that things are stabilizing and we can move forward and by replacing the higher cost institutional money to retail and commercial clients deposit and we think that with that we should be able to in a much more stabilized situation going forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i may dominic one more just around capital so you have a lot of excess capital a lot of your peer banks have reported and are building capital exiting certain lending businesses talk to us in terms of just given where we are how are you looking at market share growth opportunities are you leaning in or is the macro way too uncertain to look for growth opportunities right now dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think that you just said it kind of like answer my question with your question the macro economic situation it is uncertain it is uncertain i mean anyone said that they know exactly whats going on in the future is kidding themselves right we really dont know i mean i thought that the recession should have been here actually with the rate spike like that i thought the recession have already arrived by now it didnt so it may turn out to be a soft landing indiscernible but it may not so the economic environments certainly not something that we can bet on but in the meantime the market environment has never been as ideal as it is today when i say market environment is that for decades weve been competing with some very competitive neighborhood bankers out there and they are good as some of them good at venture capital pe some of them good at making very high net worth customers mortgages and quite frankly for price for whatever reason we decided not be able to compete today theyre gone east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 so we have just so much less competition and with our size i was sort of like being able to continue to have senior management engagement with clients were in a very good sweet spot from a market perspective i never seen east west to be in better position than we are today but the macroeconomic environment is certainly not clear and then you reflect back on another perspective which is well if im making return on equity why do i want to go crazy right now to try and do all kinds of stuff so we are watching the market were taking advantage of one customer at a time when theres some other customer from other bank who wanted to explore relationship with us we are welcoming them but we are doing it prudently not trying to go out there and then in order to make some kind of earnings then that we have to go out there and make a big group of hirings here and there and then so forth thats not necessary because we like where we are right now we have a very diversified loan portfolio very diversified deposit portfolio and thats good and if there is any good prospect coming in we certainly will entertain and but well make sure that we stay disciplined with our east west bank credit metrics and pricing metrics and thats what we are we still feel that there is opportunity to grow im not that certain about in the next two quarters how much opportunity that is but im sure in the next two or three years its going to be really good ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator our next question will come from jared shaw with wells fargo securities you may now go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just maybe sticking on with the capital theme as we go into year end with the broker deposits running down and the btfp likely to be paid off and certain cash goes down that capital will continue to grow how high is too high for capital what else can we expect the capital management to payout ratio with only here east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i think how high is too high is based on again the macroeconomic environment the way i see it is that we do a lot of these volatility comparison that is that well if we i mean many banks are buying stock because they can generate the kind of eps or return that is required and then thats what they need to what we need to do we obviously today with the capital ratio we still have industryleading roe so therefore this is indiscernible something that we have to urgently do for our shareholders in light of we also have dividend increase yearafteryear right so from that standpoint but we are shareholders friendly so when we think that we come to a point it is capital ratio getting too high there is really not much risk in the horizon in the market no in terms of in the economic outlook and then we for whatever reason feel that theres so much earnings its just not going to be possible for enough growth we absolutely would consider that buyback scenario weve done that weve done that before and we would do it again but in this kind of uncertain economic environment where we dont know whether there will be recession coming or how aggressive the fed wants to keep the rate high for how long that may cause a major downward spiral on the economic condition that affects so on industries and so forth this may create a much better opportunity for potential acquisitions or anything that is available out in the market and we dont want to spend the money on buyback and not having excess capital just like for much better opportunity because after all we dont run our bank as a quartertoquarter kind of basis we run our bank on a longterm sustainability basis for the last three quarters ive been here we always looked at yearafteryear of record earnings and yearafteryear of indiscernible we want to be able to do that and so to do that we constantly have to make investment and just like even in challenging deposit environment like the last quarter were still investing in our infrastructure were still investing in our enterprise risk management platform to make sure that we continue to have the ability to sustain the longterm growth like the way we have done for the past decades so very simple actually we have very simple kind of strategy and then its just like whatever makes sense if it makes sense well do all the right thing jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and i guess just want to follow up looking at the singlefamily residential great growth there what are some of the dynamics driving that are you still seeing strong immigration coming in is it additional capital coming into the country or is this just the existing customer base and maybe the existing potential customer base thats already in the us doing more dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc its a combination theres always immigrants coming to us the fact is we just become bigger and our brands stronger our branch network is all over the place and then people recognize the brand and so more and more of the customer in the asianamerican community that from our retail branch banking footprint coming to east west bank because they know that they can get east west to make a decision to approve credit in a timely manner will close the loans also fund the loans on a timely manner as both from services and that are broad outreach within the branch footprint allow us to continue to have a very strong momentum so far east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 again this also surprised me a little bit i would expect that with the rate rising like that people are not buying homes but i guess people are still buying homes its not just by the way just as particularly different at east west in fact throughout the country we see the statistics from this economic report that people are still buying homes so were just getting the fair share of the benefits jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator our next question will come from dave rochester with compass point you may now go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on nim good morning on the margin you mentioned the rate hike coming up would be helpful i was just curious how much of a lift you guys expect to get from that in the margin and just to reiterate youre not assuming a hike in july you have an october hike in your guidance so this july hike would obviously be a better situation right off the bat versus your guidance here right irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats right thats correct i think just to clarify our guidance is based on the forward curve as of june david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc certainly i think market expectations moved a little bit since then the lift from the rate let me get you that number i dont see i dont have it in front of me dave but certainly it helps given the variable rate loans that we have ill also say that rate hikes or not given the current environment i think were being conservative on the kind of deposit beta assumption with the expectation that even if rates do not increase from this point in time they may stay elevated for a period of time before rates decrease so thats also underpinning our kind of nii and nim guidance id also share kind of in continuation of my comments earlier so about we laid off about million or so quartertodate our plan is about billion east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 over the course of the second half of the year and with the pipelines and what were seeing on the deposit front we think thats very achievable as far as billion of broker or higher cost deposit that will run off david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc got it is that part excluded from your guidance is that just sort of icing on the cake or are you including that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats included but were modeling around the range around that how about that dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah well thats great and my followup on the expense guide it would just be great if you could talk about the drivers for the increase in that versus your prior guide and if you see any potential cost save opportunities that you guys could pursue irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question i think when we look at the expense guidance and also the increase from our prior guidance a couple of things one yeartodate the actual results and the expenses that weve incurred thus far when we look at the remainder of the year and kind of just the sentiment around things certainly things are a lot different than they were at the start and midapril thats certainly part of the reflection on what are the expenses what are the investments that we need to do to sustain the growth as dominic talked about we are continuing to see opportunities to grow frontline back office also from the risk management perspective so those are the real drivers around that nothing really unusual on the chart but we are hiring head count is over it is up yearoveryear and i think drivers to reduce certainly i think the environment changes now there are some levers there as well but i think at this point in time we dont expect that dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great thanks operator our next question will come from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley you may now go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to get a sense of what youre seeing in terms of new customer gains in your footprint on both the loan and the deposit side especially given the strong growth that youre seeing on in resi are there any gains in business that youre getting from either legacy silicon valley bank or first republic customers in your footprint dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc we are getting some we are not i mean like i said we are not like aggressively pursuing like hsbc bring the whole team over that kind of things or a bunch of people going to jpmorgan we are very selective and obviously what happened to those institutions there are a lot of bankers seeking new homes so i mean with us being in california without a doubt there are many inquiries coming to us and so we just find the right people with the right cultural fit with the right type of mindset that fit into what we in our model and then we bring them on and then same thing for customers we have i personally have more inquiries from our clients referring to friends who were customers or who still are customers for these failed banks and theyre just looking for a new home so were very busy in discussion with many of those and we some of those loans booked i mean if you look at ci you noticed that commitment gone up but outstanding balance gone up we took a lot of commitment but its going to take a little while to do the drawdown and same thing for deposits we opened lot of accounts but it takes a little while to start getting them operating and start getting deposit flowing and were not trying to hurry up in doing that because again its not like that we have one quarter or two quarter or three quarters finish line and then were done were running a longterm business and so we just gradually start taking on these new clients making sure that they get the right experience and then we also dont want it to get overwhelmed with a surge of these inquiries and ending up neglecting our existing customers so and then in addition to that we also wanted to continue our journey of further enhancing and upgrading our whole enterprise risk management and so these work cannot be sort of like put aside just because there are inquiries from customers from these failed banks and have wanted to migrate over and then we stop taking care of all the other fundamental business that we need to take care of so allinall we just like doing all of that in the same time and i would expect a gradual slowly gradually well get more of these customers not only from the failed banks by the way some of these other regional banks or that also have some sort of challenges that also have their customers going to be start looking at east west because many of these clients are going to be looking at who are the banks have a high likelihood they dont have to worry much about the future and banks have very high capital ratio and year in year out always put out strong numbers and dont always get in and out of jail with the regulators they are the one that in general are going to be well sought after so therefore we want to keep it that way so we dont want to go crazy i mean and get all excited about this opportunity and then get ourselves back in jail or something like that that wouldnt be good right so thats what were manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 indiscernible thanks for that and i guess related to that in terms of investing in the business i mean i know you moved your expense guide up slightly can you talk about whats driving that revision is it mainly investment spend is it some opportunity youre seeing in this environment and then how we should think about just expenses overall even going into next year as maybe you continue to invest in the business but also as i guess the bank industry as a whole sees more of an impact from regulation if theres anything else you need to do there given your asset size dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well we are less than billion and far less than billion we are billion to be exact and so therefore this is around twothird just above twothird of that threshold so right now looking at organic growth its going to take a while to get to that billion also if you think about it even if were billion we always do whatever we need to do to make sure that we are above and beyond the minimal requirement that required from the regulators and so with our capital ratio its really not much an issue at all because you look at a lot other banks are really struggling with the potential new regulatory proposal because the capital ratio is low and then once they start adding here one items here and there and then next thing they may not meet the threshold we are way above it so one way or the other it doesnt make any difference but i wanted to keep reminding folks on the call that were actually only twothirds the size so were not quantifying to worry but in the meantime getting back to the increase slight increase of guidance of the expenses as irene mentioned earlier that as of april in the midapril when we start putting into guidance after the first quarter earnings in the midst of the silicon valley bank signature bank and first republic kind of situation we didnt expect theres much opportunity to grow at that point because we expected therell be probably a recession coming right so thats going to drop rate and all of that didnt happen so in fact not only it didnt happen and indiscernible we saw that our deposit also kind of stabilized a little bit and the customer demand got much higher rate it was very much so in march and april but by may or so it somewhat subsided and in addition to that those inquiries from customers of these banks that got into trouble start coming because once it stabilized they start looking at that well maybe some of the new parents that apply those indiscernible are not the right set and they start talking to us when we start looking at all of that we feel that it is appropriate to start hiring some of the talented bankers and it is appropriate that we continue to stay vigilant to invest whatever we need to invest were not over investing we never over invest east west always invest incrementally from a technology from operation infrastructure and in terms of hiring but we are absolutely out there looking at talents to see whether they fit into our culture and bring them on we do not get way over concerned about whoa would that affect or of our expenses and then therefore we should wait sometimes you wait you dont get them and but why we feel comfortable about doing all that is because we still have positive operating leverage today so one way or the other were still making more money because that revenue growth is still going to be bigger than the expense growth so we feel very confident that this is the right thing to do in light of what our very high return of equity ratio compared with the industry lets just continue to keep doing whats right whats good for the bank manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc right it sounds like the its the expanse and the investment spend is coming more from a growth mindset rather than anything that regulators might even ask banks well below billion to do so i appreciate that thank you east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah operator our next question will come from brandon king with truist you may now go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yes so i noticed criticized loans had declined quarteroverquarter and it stands out amongst your peers indiscernible the opposite effect so if you could please elaborate on to what youre seeing with your customers thats driving that effect dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well what weve seen is that weve seen nothing thats the scary part well actually we do regular loanbyloan review thats part of east west bank its been doing weve been doing this for years and years ive been concerned about a potential cre portfolio five six years ago and so we do loanbyloan review and we continue well i guess because of that vigilance we do have pretty high asset quality from our portfolio and we do the same thing for ci and we just even with the pandemic i thought its going to be i mean we started lets get back to earlier lets start with the tariffs that we said wow with the tariff our trade finance portfolio is going to be getting hit hard lets just review one by one we review one by one we manage this quite really really closely monitor it very closely we have discussion with the clients ask them to do what the right thing and then in the end of day we didnt take any losses and gets through that and that becomes tariffs becomes just a normal daytoday business and then we go into a pandemic we thought wow were going to lose a lot of money were taking a lot of losses with all these hotels and strip centers shut down and tenants not paying rent in their apartments and then at the end of the day we didnt take any losses and then when theres interest rate spike in this very very aggressive manner we said theres no way our clients can pay this kind of interest rate at some point but as of today theyre paying it and theyre doing fine well i think brandon it helps when we have a very loantovalue which give a lot more incentive for clients to stay on at east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 the property and in addition to that our clients have a lot of liquidity and many of them have personal guarantee all of these characteristics help to keep this portfolio strong in the commercial real estate side and then brandon if you i think that as i mentioned as part of my sort of like a script that we talked about earlier loans mature in theres only of our cre loans will be maturing for the remainder of and then in only another so all together for the next months we will have of our loans coming due so we just happen to have very stable portfolio that theres not a whole lot that we need to worry about we dont have this big high rise building in downtown that cause us cause other banks concern so i think is all of that that helps now the criticized asset improves in terms of ratio some of that have to do again because weve been prudent and conservative these loans that we downgrade during pandemic we wanted to give a little more time to make sure we could have upgraded probably six nine months ago i mean because when after the pandemic things getting a bit normal some of the business getting back on track we didnt need upgrade we wanted to see how they operate do they have a sustainable good cash flow when things are getting better really better and then we upgrade that so to a certain degree maybe some of this upgrade theres a little bit of a timing difference its not like suddenly today this credit perform even better than two months ago three months ago indiscernible they just there are some i would say that long should have been upgraded earlier but we took care now for just the last few months and the other thing will be there a couple of loans here and there that are having some challenges we find a way to help the clients to pay off this credit and also help reduce the criticized loans ratio and all in all thats i think thats the reason brandon king q analyst truist securities inc thanks thanks thats really great color and then i noticed ci realization tick down a bit in the quarter and i know there have been some deleveraging from your customers but im wondering just what youre seeing in the front lines there and indiscernible continuing towards the back half of the year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc second half of the year yeah so ci i think quite candidly with just kind of the environment right now the utilization did tick down a little bit brandon as you mentioned i would share though as we look and to a certain extent theres only so much we can do with that right as dominic mentioned commitments are up i would share though when we look at the pipelines and when we talk to our team leaders the expectation for the second half of the year of new client acquisition is something where it is increasingly positive thats certainly something that we have factored in for the second half of the year with that said given the current environment and i would say that were not necessarily expecting that utilization rate will increase substantially from this point but i would also say no specific kind of areas or concentrations of where that growth is coming from its pretty broad based brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 thank you operator our next question will come from matthew clark with piper sandler you may now go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning thanks for taking the questions just to close the loop on the margin irene can you give us a sense for where you think the cycle deposit beta might shake out at the end of the day i think low is what you were previously targeting but were there on a spot basis and then if you had the monthly nim in june well take it irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so the monthly nim in june was the same as the month end spot of the also ill share up until now in july its been the same indiscernible irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats right yeah im sorry im sorry cost of deposits not the nim i think the expectation for nim is that it will decrease modestly from the second quarter but still nii with the drivers that were talking about we expected that to flatten out and improve matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co got it and then just on the media and entertainment portfolio i know its only of loans but can you speak to the hollywood shutdown and how that might impact the portfolio and what you might have in place in terms of structure to protect yourselves dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah from a credit risk perspective we dont have any concern but from a production like growth volume on loan origination point of view well actually we booked a lot of entertainment content production loans but if theres a strike theyre not going to draw down so we hope the strike doesnt last too long but if it sustains for an extended period of time then we will have some loans that may not have the kind of drawdown that we would like to have and its not going to have any credit quality issue so but the beauty of this is that thats why we have a very diversified loan portfolio and if entertainment content production financing slowing down a little bit some of the others just have to make it up or were going to have to get our lending officers to continue to work on this new prospective clients and get those loans funded to offset against the slowdown in the entertainment side but all in all i looked at it is that its not going to be any credit quality issue its just all coming back to get outstanding balance on that particular portfolio matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 great thanks for the color dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well i do want to mention we if you look at the chart page we highlight that theres of our loans that are in media and entertainment again i want to highlight its media and entertainment so we do have also a good decentsized portfolio of digital media and theyre not affected by strikes these are the one that building videogames and then some of the other things they are not part of the hollywood labors forces so its very different so its a combination that make up to so its not as sizeable as what we reflected here on page irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc and ill just add i answered matthews question incorrectly so the answer as far as the monthly nim for june was matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co thanks again operator our next question will come from gary tenner with da davidson you may now go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co irene i wanted to kind of revisit your comments about the plan billion of brokered runoff backhalf of the year i know you dont give kind of deposit growth guidance but as were thinking about the balance sheet should we be thinking of that billion being replaced by customer deposits and then an additional growth on top of that basically equal plus or minus your loan growth in the back half of the year so is that kind of the way to think about the rest out of the balance sheet irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc gary that is the plan gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay and then the second part of that question i guess is the million or so that youve kind of let roll off so far in july and replaced by customer deposits whats the incremental or the marginal cost of the new customer east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 deposits that are coming in it sounds like it must be pretty close to kind of the june spot rate because it doesnt sound like thats moved very much irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah well i think the actually thats a great question the incremental deposits new customers new cises thats indiscernible there is a little bit kind of marginal increase that is happening some of that has been a little bit of migration that weve seen with the higher rate environment qcds especially on the consumer side but predominantly when we look at growth gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co the mix coming in is more cdr indiscernible irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah well the consumer side and let me clarify i think the growth dollar wise is commercial side but overall on the consumer side especially with cds that is something that continues to be a pressure on the margin in total but new customer acquisition generally that has been commercialoriented and lower in rates gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks and then i guess one more question on the kind of beta and deposit pricing historically you think of there being kind of this long or multiquarter deposit catch up after the fed stops raising rates in a scenario where a hike next week is the last one and that has some impact on the third quarter and given the amount of catch up weve had over the last couple of quarters thats been incredibly rapid is your sense that fourth quarter that kind of delta assuming no additional hikes after next week moderates pretty significantly to where the lag after the fed the feds last hike is much shorter in nature or do you have any sense of how that might play out irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i mean gary honestly your guess is as good as mine right around that but realistically as were kind of modeling it out our assumptions are that there will be a lag and the deposit costs will remain somewhat elevated for a period of time now there have been different examples relative in the relative kind of recent history as well lets say when the pandemic hit and rates changed dramatically where we were able to go in and dramatically lower deposit costs as well but as were modeling out with our guidance for the rest of the year were not assuming that gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co yeah no im certainly not suggesting that deposit costs go back to the other direction but more so that the lag following the fed hike is bit shorter perhaps than its been in the past okay all right thanks for taking the questions dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 yeah at this point i think yeah at this point logically i would expect that it would ease i mean if you look at the rate spike it affect the entire banking industry its because of march march the news of silicon valley bank that caused a dramatic change on the rate environment that it heightened the attention for consumer and consumer retail or commercial customers and then everybody started looking at either moving deposit out or asking for a higher rate and then so one sort of like a one big two to three weeks time then just caused this big surge of interest rate and obviously that has subsided dramatically so we dont see that another basis points is going to make that much of a difference by now because the banking industries have stabilized and i assume that the other banks would also be a little bit more prudent in terms of not going out there and then putting out very high rate to attract deposits and when thats the case the competition ease and no one has to really put up a higher rate but when the competition go crazy and then we all have to sort of like somewhat move along in the same direction operator our next question will come from chris mcgratty with kbw you may now go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great just a quick one irene on the margin the quarteronquarter change from two cuts to one additional hike was the reason for the ph trim guide if the forward curve plays out and we get cuts next year can you just make a comment or two about how you think the margin may react irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question i think first of all we will give guidance for in january and thats not something that were planning to do today given the variable nature of our loan book that is something chris that weve tried to be disciplined around and putting on swaps and hedges to preserve the net interest income and the interest income on loans as much as possible this year thats been tough as far as the impact of that to the interest income on loans and also aoci quite frankly but certainly i think if the rate cuts happen thatll be something that we were fortunate to do and partner it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks operator our next question will come from brody preston with ubs you may now go ahead brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hi everyone irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc irene i just wanted to i know its not a huge driver of quarterly results but i just wanted to ask if you had any thoughts around fee income moving forward if you thought kind of this i would call it probably and change in kind of core modelable items going forward if you thought that this was a good run rate or where that would shake out irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question and in fact i think the growth rate on that has been something that has also been a great surprise for us as far as transaction volume notional amounts fx volumes consumer commercial the growth that weve seen there thats been great from the irc swap teams again same thing volumes are increasing and in fact across the board wealth management loan fees a little bit and even the account deposit fees have all been up quarteroverquarter which is quite positive and ill just share though with the total fee income there is also a little marktomarket and with the kind of movement in the tenure that played a factor as well with that said i think that the momentum is pretty good i do think that maybe this quarter its a little bit higher than normalized but certainly when we look at the rest of the year and the pipeline looks great we are acquiring new clients and that is something that is very positive brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay got it could i ask just on the fixed rate loan portfolio i know that a good chunk of it is singlefamily resi but just i guess when you look at the fixed rate loan book whats the dollar amount thats repricing over the next months and what are the current yields look like on those loans and if you get bifurcate it maybe between the cre and everything else that would be helpful irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah so over the next months we have approximately million of fixed and hybrid fixed loan cre and singlefamily maturing or repricing and then if you kind of break that down its a little different per category but on average were talking about probably a weighted average interest of that we expect to move up brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and did you mention already what the new origination yields would look like for those loans irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah to clarify some of this is on maturity and some of this is hybrids that are going to step up so i think in the current environment the hybrids step up especially for the single family theres a cap on that but with that said if we look at the new originations generally speaking ci has been about indiscernible flat cre for hybrid and variable rate a blended maybe a and single family if you look at the current originations its been about so as we noted a lot of these where price has been locked a while ago when they started the applicant started the process but the current rate indiscernible for 30year fixed mortgage no points east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you and then i did want to ask do you happen to know what the effect of duration of your afs portfolio is and what the conditional prepayment rate youre assuming in that duration calculation is irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah the effect of duration has slightly reduced quarteroverquarter just a little bit honestly more of a tenor and the change so were probably right now down modestly the cpr i think if we look at the mbs and also the cmbs generally i mean the prepayments have slowed dramatically i can get you the specifics of that later brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay great and then the last question that i had was just it sounds like theres some improvement in the mix shift in june and youve got the brokered rundown and if maybe we stabilize mix shift can kind of steady out here at least on the nibs but i guess i was hoping that maybe you could help me think about the bifurcation between commercial clients and retail customers at this point and how mix and beta acceleration between those customers are may be differentiated at this point in the cycle because i guess my baseline thought would that you would have gotten a lot of commercial mix and beta catchup done earlier and already and then maybe youre going to have more of a catchup on the retail side just because theyre a little bit slower to move i just i was hoping that maybe you could speak to that irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think thats a great question i would say that probably what we have seen is that youre right youre exactly right on the commercial side it was earlier on the consumer side there was a lagging impact and part of that is the nature of the customers that we have brody we have many many customers thousands where their primary personal checking account is at east west that is still as of today as of billion of the dda balances are consumer checking accounts now in this current environment weve had trouble growing that quite candidly as clients and customers are moving their access liquidity to cds so one of the things that we saw in the second quarter is that although there was quite a lag overall on the consumer deposit betas up until the second quarter with this mix shift and the pivot a little bit to cds and dda consumer balances remaining stable which quite candidly in the current environment tough to do but indiscernible the betas on consumer did increase from where we were at and this point in time quite honestly if we look toward the future i think with the growth that we continue to see and the opportunities on the commercial side perhaps over time on the commercial side i think consumer it will kind of moderate right because to a certain extent if you havent been alerted to the interest rate environment or youre probably not going to at this point in time so were not seeing that continual migration as well on the consumer side but the commercial side is we continue to onboard new clients i think that will help as well operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to dominic for any closing remarks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west
