questions until the completion of the formal remarks at which time youll be given instructions for the questionandanswer session also as a reminder this conference is being recorded today if you have any objections please disconnect at this time ms landis you may begin jennifer landis headinvestor relations citigroup inc thank you operator good morning and thank you all for joining our second quarter earnings call i am joined today by our chief executive officer jane fraser and our chief financial officer mark mason id like to remind you that todays presentation which is available for download on our website citigroupcom may contain forwardlooking statements which are based on managements current expectations and are subject to uncertainty and changes in circumstances actual results may differ materially from these statements due to a variety of factors including those described in our earnings materials as well as in our sec filings and with that ill turn it over to jane jane nind fraser chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you jenn and good morning to everyone before i discuss the results for the quarter let me first address the regulatory action by the federal reserve and the office of the comptroller of the currency which were announced on wednesday these actions pertain to the consent orders we entered into with both agencies in and those orders covered four primary areas risk management data governance controls and compliance addressing these areas is the primary goal of our transformation our number one priority it is a multiyear effort to modernize our infrastructure unify disparate tech platforms and automate processes and controls this weeks actions focus primarily on data quality management weve been public this year about the fact that we were behind in this particular area and that we had increased our investment as a result the regulatory actions consisted of two civil money penalties and under the amended consent order with the occ a new process designed to ensure were allocating sufficient resources to meet our remediation milestones and that is called the resource review plan we are currently developing the plan for submission to the occ now by way of background while the federal reserve is the primary regulator for citigroup our bank holding company the occ is the primary regulator for citibank na we call it cbna which is our largest banking vehicle with approximately of our assets the amended consent order with the occ allows cbna to continue paying to citigroup at a minimum the dividends necessary for debt service preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations while were citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 developing and seeking occ consent for our resource review plan dividend amounts above that would require the occs nonobjection now these dividends are intercompany payments that are made from cbna ultimately to the parent citigroup they should not be confused with the common dividends citigroup pays through its shareholders indeed there is no restriction on citigroups ability to pay common dividends to shareholders nor is there a restriction to buying back shares and let me be very clear even with the investments needed for our transformation citigroup has more than sufficient resources to also invest in our businesses and make the planned return of capital to our shareholders we will increase our dividend from to a share as we announced in late june and we will resume modest buybacks this quarter while these actions were not entirely unexpected to us it is no doubt disappointing for our investors and for our people we completely understand that at the same time were confident in our ability to get these specific areas where they need to be as we have been able to do in other areas of the transformation and we are pleased that it was acknowledged on wednesday that we have made meaningful progress in executing our transformation and simplifying our firm a multiyear undertaking such as this was never going to be linear but i can assure you the investments we have been making are starting to come together to reduce risk improve control and deliver very tangible outcomes the tech investments we have made are making a difference we have reduced the time it takes to book loans automated controls for our traders to reduce errors moved risk analytics to a cloudbased infrastructure and increased the resiliency of our platforms to reduce downtime the changes to our organization and our culture are making a difference we have eliminated managerial constructs and layers whilst empowering our leaders we introduced new tools to better manage human capital needs our focus on culture has increased accountability and attracted great new talent such as vis raghavan tim ryan and andy sieg you have my and the entire managements team commitment that we will address any area of the consent order where we are behind by putting the necessary resources and focus behind it we will get this work where it needs to be as we have with the execution of our strategy and the simplification of our organization now turning to what was another good quarter our results show the relentless focus we have in executing our strategy as we continue to drive towards our mediumterm return target we reported net income of billion with an earnings per share of and an rotce of revenues were up overall as well as up in each of our five core businesses where all but one had positive operating leverage expenses were down yearoveryear the steps were taking to simplify our organization rightsize businesses such as markets and wealth and reduce stranded costs are beginning to take hold even as we increase investment in our transformation over the medium term we expect these simplification and stranded cost actions to drive billion to billion in annual run rate saves services grew driven by solid fee growth which we have prioritized tts saw increased activity in cross border payments and in commercial cards securities services was up with new client onboarding deepening with existing clients and market valuations helping increase our assets under custody by a preliminary citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 at our recent services investor day we very much enjoyed the opportunity to talk to you in depth about how were going to continue to grow this highreturning business and were very pleased that people are starting to recognize why we describe it as our crown jewel overall markets had a strong finish to the quarter leading to better performance than wed anticipated fixed income was slightly down yearonyear due to lower fx than rates but we had good issuance and loan growth and financing and securitization an area which generates attractive returns equities was up driven by strong performance in derivatives which includes a gain on the visa b exchange offer banking was up as the wallet rebound gained some momentum and we again grew share our clients continued to access debt capital markets with investment grade issuance nearrecord levels equity issuance increased particularly in convertibles as companies wait for a fuller opening of the ipo window investment banking fees were up versus the prior year and weve seen some healthy volumes associated with announced deals yeartodate particularly in natural resources and technology combined with the strong pipeline advisory activity looks promising as we think about the rest of the year and into next year wealth is starting to improve growth in client investment assets drove stronger investment revenue especially in citigold and was up a preliminary our focus on rationalizing the expense base is also starting to pay off with expenses down andy and his team continued to attract top talent from the industry as they focus on our investments business and on enhancing the client experience us personal banking saw revenue growth of with all three businesses again contributing to the top line there was good revolving balance and loan growth in both branded cards and retail services and we continue to see differentiation in the credit segment with the lower income customers seeing pressure retail banking benefited from higher mortgage loans and improved deposit spreads while delivering strong referrals to wealth overall while we saw operating margin expansion our poor returns were pressured by the combination of credit seasonality and the normalization of certain vintages we certainly expect uspbs returns to improve from here the recent stress test again showcased the strength of our balance sheet our cet1 ratio now stands at and we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to as of october given the reduction of our stress capital buffer our tangible book value per share grew to during the quarter we returned billion in capital to our common shareholders and we are increasing our dividend by we expect to buy back billion in common shares this quarter and we will continue to assess the level of buybacks on a quarterly basis particularly given the uncertainty around the basel iii endgame looking at the macro environment as we enter the second half of the year the us is still the worlds most structurally sound economy after a break in progress inflation now appears back on a downward trajectory services spending has remained on an upward trend although there were clear signs of a softening labor market and the tightening of the consumer budget and of course you might have heard there is an election in november in europe while rate cuts have begun the regions lack of competitiveness continues to be a drag on growth in asia china is growing moderately albeit with government stimulus and their pivot to hightech manufacturing is being challenged by tariffs on evs and semiconductors despite this uncertainty as you saw at our services citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 investor day when we went through our performance over the last two years our business model can produce good results in a wide variety of macro environments and there is plenty of upside for us across our five businesses we have made an incredible amount of progress in simplification both strategically and organizationally weve completed most of the exits of our international consumer market we streamlined our organization to capitalize agility and faster decisionmaking we are modernizing our infrastructure to improve our client service and we are automating processes to strengthen controls we are on a deliberate path we will continue to execute our transformation and our strategy so we can meet our mediumterm targets and then continue to further improve our returns over time with that let me turn it over to mark and then we will be delighted as always to take your questions mark a l mason chief financial officer citigroup inc thanks jane and good morning everyone im going to start with the firmwide financial results focusing on year overyear comparisons for the second quarter unless i indicate otherwise and then spend a little more time on the business on slide we show financial results for the full firm for the quarter we reported net income of approximately billion eps of and rotce of on billion of revenue total revenues were up driven by growth across all businesses as well as an approximate million gain related to the visa b exchange offer a significant portion of this gain is reflected in equity markets with the remainder reflected in all other expenses were billion down and on a sequential basis the combination of revenue growth and expense decline drove positive operating leverage for the firm in the majority of our businesses cost of credit was billion primarily driven by higher card net credit losses which were partially offset by acl releases in all businesses except uspb where we built for loan growth at the end of the quarter we had nearly billion of total reserves with a reservetofunded loan ratio of approximately on slide we show the expense trend over the past five quarters this quarter we reported expenses of billion down and sequentially which includes the million civil money penalties imposed by the fed and occ earlier this week the decrease in expenses was primarily driven by savings associated with our organizational simplification stranded cost reduction and lower repositioning costs partially offset by continued investment in transformation and the fed and the occ penalty as we said over the past few months we will continue to invest in the transformation and technology to modernize our operations and risk and control infrastructure we expect these investments to offset some of our saves and head count reduction going forward however based on what we know today we will likely be at the higher end of the expense guidance range excluding the fdic special assessment and the civil money penalty with that said we will of course continue to look for opportunities to absorb the civil money penalties before going into the balance sheet and the business results for the quarter id like to also give more color on the transformation and address what the fed and occ announced wednesday we made good progress on our transformation in certain areas over the last few years and i want to highlight some of those areas before discussing the announcement citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 first wholesale credit and loan operations where we implemented a consistent endtoend operating model and consolidated multiple systems with enhanced technology this has not only reduced risk but enhanced operating efficiency and the client experience weve also made improvements in risk and compliance as we enhanced our risk assessment and technology capabilities to increase automation for monitoring and in data while theres a lot more to do we stood up a data governance process and streamline our data architecture to ultimately facilitate straightthrough processing overall weve improved risk management and consolidated and upgraded systems and platforms to improve our resiliency these efforts represent meaningful examples of how were making progress against our transformation milestones that said we have fallen short in data quality management particularly related to regulatory reporting which weve acknowledged publicly since the beginning of the year as such weve begun to put additional investments and resources in place to not only address data quality management related to regulatory reporting and data governance but also stress testing capabilities including dfast and resolutionrecovery we also reprioritized our efforts to ensure we are focused on data that impacts these reports first we take this feedback from our regulators very seriously and were committed to allocating all the resources necessary to meet their expectations now turning back to the quarterly results on slide we show net interest income deposits and loans where ill speak to sequential variance in the second quarter net interest income was roughly flat excluding markets net interest income was down largely driven by the impact of foreign exchange translation seasonally lower revolving card balances and lower interest rates in argentina partially offset by higher deposit spreads in wealth average loans were roughly flat as growth in cards and mexico consumer was largely offset by slight declines across businesses and average deposits decreased by largely driven by seasonal outflows and transfers to investments in wealth as well as nonoperational outflows in tts on slide we show key consumer and corporate credit metrics which reflect our disciplined risk appetite framework across our card portfolios approximately of our card loans are to consumers with fico scores of or higher and while we continue to see an overall resilient us consumer we also continue to see a divergence in performance and behavior across fico and income band when we look across our consumer clients only the highest income quartile has more savings than they did at the beginning of and it is the over fico score customers that are driving the spend growth and maintaining high payment rates lower fico band customers are seeing sharper drops in payment rates and borrowing more as they are more acutely impacted by high inflation and interest rates that said as we will discuss later were seeing signs of stabilization and delinquency performance across our cards portfolio and weve taken this all into account in our reserving and we remain wellreserved with a reserve tofunded loan ratio of for our total card portfolio our corporate portfolio is largely investment grade and approximately as of the second quarter and we saw a nearly million sequential decrease in corporate nonaccrual loans largely driven by upgrades and repayment additionally this quarter we saw an improvement in our macro assumptions driven by hpi oil prices and equity market valuations and our credit loss reserves continued to incorporate a scenarioweighted average unemployment rate of nearly and a downside unemployment rate of nearly as such we feel very comfortable with the nearly billion of reserves that we have in the current environment citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 turning to slide id like to take a moment to highlight the strength of our balance sheet capital and liquidity it is this strength that allows us to support clients through periods of uncertainty and volatility our balance sheet is a reflection of our risk appetite strategy and diversified business model our trillion deposit base is well diversified across regions industries customers and account types the majority of our deposits are corporate at billion and span countries and as you heard at the services investor day most of these deposits are held in operating accounts that are crucial to how our clients fund their daily operations around the world making them operational in nature and therefore very stable the majority of our remaining deposits about billion are welldiversified across the private bank citigold retail and wealth at work offerings as well as across regions and products of our total deposits are us dollardenominated with the remainder spanning over currency our asset mix also reflects our strong risk appetite framework our billion loan portfolio is welldiversified across consumer and corporate loans and about onethird of our balance sheet is held in cash and highquality short duration investment securities that contribute to our approximately billion of available liquidity resources we continue to feel very good about the strength of our balance sheet and the quality of our assets and liabilities which position us to be a source of strength for the industry and importantly for our clients on slide we show a sequential walk to provide more detail on the drivers of our cet1 ratio this quarter we ended the quarter with a preliminary cet1 capital ratio approximately basis points or approximately billion above our current regulatory capital requirement of we expect our regulatory capital requirement to decrease to as of october which incorporates the reduction in our stress capital buffer from to the indicative scb of we announced a couple of weeks ago we were pleased to see the improvement in our dfast results and the corresponding reduction in our scb that said even with the reduction our capital requirement does not yet fully reflect our simplification efforts the benefits of our transformation or the full execution of our strategy all of which we expect to reduce our capital requirements over time and as a reminder we announced an increase to our common dividend from per share to per share following the scb results and as jane mentioned earlier we plan on doing billion of buybacks this quarter so now turning to slide before i get into the businesses as a reminder in the fourth quarter of last year we implemented a revenue sharing arrangement within banking and between banking services and markets to reflect the benefit the businesses get from our relationshipbased lending the impact of revenue sharing is included in the all other line for each business in our financial supplement in services revenues were up this quarter reflecting continued underlying momentum across both tts and securities services net interest income was down largely driven by lower earnings on our net investment in argentina partially offset by the benefit of higher us and nonus interest rates relative to the prioryear period noninterest revenue increased driven by continued strength across underlying fee drivers as well as a smaller impact from currency devaluation in argentina the underlying growth in both businesses is a result of our continued investment in product innovation client experience and platform modernization that we highlighted during our services investor day last month expenses increased largely driven by an argentinarelated citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 transaction tax expense a legal settlement expense and continued investments in product innovation and technology cost of credit was a benefit of million driven by an acl release in the quarter average loans were up primarily driven by continued demand for export and agency finance particularly in asia as well as working capital loans to corporate and commercial clients in latin america and asia average deposits were down driven by nonoperating deposit outflows at the same time we continue to see good operating deposit inflows net income was approximately billion and services continues to deliver a high rotce coming in at for the quarter on slide we show the results for markets for the second quarter markets revenues were up fixed income revenues decreased driven by rates and currencies which were down on the back of lower volatility and tighter spreads this was partially offset by strength in spread products and other fixed income which was up primarily driven by continued loan growth and higher securitization and underwriting fees in addition to a benefit from the visa b exchange offer we continued to see good underlying momentum in equity primarily driven by equity derivative and we continued to make progress in prime with balances up approximately expenses decreased driven by productivity savings partially offset by higher volumerelated expenses cost of credit was a benefit of million as an acl release more than offset net credit loss average loans increased largely driven by assetbacked lending and spread products average trading assets increased largely driven by client demand for treasuries and mortgagebacked securities markets generated positive operating leverage and delivered net income of approximately billion with an rotce of for the quarter on slide we show the results for banking for the second quarter banking revenues increased driven by growth in investment banking and corporate lending investment banking revenues increased driven by strength across capital markets and advisory given favorable market conditions dcm continued to benefit from strong issuance activities mainly in investment grade as issuers continued to derisk funding plans in advance of what could be a more volatile second half and the context of a number of important global elections as well as the macro environment in ecm excluding china a shares were seeing a pickup in ipo activity led by the us as well as continued convertible issuance as issuers take advantage of strong equity market performance and expectations for rates to be higher for longer and in advisory were seeing revenues from the relatively low announced activity in coming to fruition as those transactions close both yeartodate and in the quarter we gained share across dcm ecm and advisory particularly in technology where weve been investing corporate lending revenues excluding marktomarket on loan hedges increased largely driven by higher revenue share we generated positive operating leverage again this quarter as expenses decreased primarily driven by actions taken to rightsize the expense base cost of credit was a benefit of million driven by an acl release reflecting an improvement in the macroeconomic outlook partially offset by net credit loss average loans decreased as we maintained strict discipline around returns combined with lower overall demand for credit net income was million and rotce was for the quarter citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 on slide we show the results for wealth for the second quarter wealth revenues increased driven by a increase in nir from higher investment fee revenues partially offset by a decrease in nii from higher mortgage funding costs we continue to see good momentum in noninterest revenue as we benefited from doubledigit client investment asset growth both in north america and internationally driven by net new client investment assets as well as market valuation expenses were down driven by the initial benefit of expense reductions as we rightsized the workforce and expense base cost of credit was a benefit of million as an acl release more than offset net credit loss preliminary endofperiod client balances increased driven by higher client investment assets as well as higher deposits average loans were flat as we continued to optimize capital usage average deposits increased largely reflecting transfer of relationships and associated deposit from uspb partially offset by a shift in deposits to higheryielding investments on citis platform client investment assets were up driven by net new investment assets flows and the benefit of higher market valuation wealth generated positive operating leverage this quarter and delivered net income of million with an rotce of for the quarter on slide we show the results for us personal banking for the second quarter us personal banking revenues increased driven by nii growth of and lower partner payment branded cards revenues increased driven by interestearning balance growth of as payment rates continue to moderate and we continue to see growth in spend volumes of primarily driven by customers with fico scores of or higher retail services revenues increased primarily driven by lower payments from citi to our partners due to higher net credit losses and interestearning balances grew retail banking revenues increased driven by higher deposit spreads as well as mortgage and installment loan growth uspb also generated positive operating leverage this quarter with expenses down driven by lower technology and compensation costs partially offset by higher volumerelated expenses cost of credit increased to billion largely driven by higher ncls of billion and an acl build of approximately million reflecting volume growth in the quarter but let me remind you of the three things driving our ncls this quarter first card loan vintages that were originated over the last few years are all maturing at the same time these vintages were delayed in their maturation due to the unprecedented levels of government stimulus during the pandemic second we continue to see higher ncls in the second quarter third certain pockets of customers continue to be impacted by persistent inflation and higher interest rates resulting in higher losses however across both portfolios we are seeing signs of stabilization in delinquency performance but we will continue to watch the impact of persistent inflation and high interest rates as the year progresses despite these factors we still expect branded cards to be in the to ncl range for the full year and retail services to be at the high end of the range of to average deposits decreased as the transfer of relationships and the associated deposits to our wealth business more than offset the underlying growth net income was million and rotce for the quarter was as we said before we will continue to take actions to manage through the regulatory headwind lap the credit cycle and grow revenue while improving the overall operating efficiency of the business to ultimately get to a high teens return over the medium term citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 on slide we show results for all other on a managed basis which includes corporate other and legacy franchises and excludes divestiturerelated items revenues decreased primarily driven by the closed exits and winddowns and higher funding costs partially offset by growth in mexico as well as the impact from the visa b exchange offer and expenses decreased primarily driven by closed exits and winddowns slide shows our fullyear outlook and mediumterm guidance both of which remain unchanged we continue to remain laserfocused on executing on our transformation and enhancing the business performance and while we recognize theres a lot more to do on transformation were pleased with the progress that were making towards our and mediumterm targets and remain committed to these targets with that jane and i will be happy to take your questions question and answer section operator operator instructions okay our first question will come from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi could you elaborate more on the amended consent order jane you said it was disappointing to have gotten that this week its almost four years into the consent order and a little bit why it hasnt been resolved and whats on thats the loss column and maybe a little bit more on the win column too i mean you have what people thrown at the problem billions of dollars is it not enough people is it not enough money do you need to look at it in a different way are you not talking the same language i mean you had john dugan as your lead independent director ex sort of the occ and it seems like you got your report card i guess you passed overall they went out of their way to say some nice things but it looks like you got failing grades in data and regulatory management so youre confident its going to be resolved but its already been four years and it hasnt been resolved so what is it going to take from here and how can you resolve the regulatory concerns while continuing or serving shareholders better and then in the win column since its so nebulous this back office what are you achieving you mentioned some items but if you could put more meat on those bones thanks jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yes thank you mike thats a few different parts to that so lets start by just taking a step back our transformation is addressing decades of underinvestment in large parts of citis infrastructure and in our risk and control environment and when you unpack that those areas where we had an absence of enforced enterprise wide standards and governance weve had a siloed organization thats prevented scale a culture where a lot of groups were allowed to solve problem the same problem in different ways fragmented tech platforms manual processes and controls and a weak first line of defense too few subject matter experts so this is a massive body of work that goes well beyond the consent order and this is not old citi putting in band aids this is citi tackling the root issues head on its a multiyear undertaking as weve talked about and you saw the statement by one of our regulators this week we have made meaningful progress on our transformation and on our simplification citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 mark do you want to mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and so as jane says the progress that weve made it spans multiple parts of the consent order and transformation work remember that consent order and transformation work includes risk it includes controls it includes compliance it includes data and data related to the regulatory reporting and weve got evidence and proof points of progress against all of those things jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc thank you mark so transforming to answer your question about how do we fix it and serve our investors at the same time transforming citi will drive benefits for our shareholders our clients and our regulators this is not mutually exclusive at the beginning of the year we honed in on two priorities the transformation and improving our business performance awere able to do so because weve largely cleared the decks we have a clear focus strategy weve executed the divestitures weve got a much simpler organization so we can focus on these two priorities and we are able to do both you can see that in our results again this quarter multiple solid proof points on the execution of the strategy and we know what we need to do on both fronts we have plans in place on the transformation and on the strategy and were executing against them we have been and we will be transparent when we have issues and how we are addressing them mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and just to add a couple of data points to that mike youve heard us mention some of these before but weve retired platforms weve reduced the number of data centers platforms are down some weve moved from corporate loan platforms down to south of weve got cash equities execution platforms down to one weve reduced the six reporting ledgers down to one sanction platforms down to one so weve been making considerable progress over the past couple of years with that said theres a lot more work to be done around the data regulatory reporting work if you think about citi weve got global total reg reports right so weve got to make sure that the data thats going into those reports is the quality of the data that we want it to be but more importantly that were doing it efficiently that it doesnt take thousands of people to reconcile that information and so this is an endtoend process in the way were approaching it one example is the liquidity report that we have it has lines of data and that data is its important again that were efficiently collecting it from multiple systems with standards and governance that ensures that its of the quality that we want it to be without again having to have manual activity supporting it operator the next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open please go ahead citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thank you so mark i heard your comments on credit this year im talking the us private personal banking i heard your comments for credit the rest of this year and i think in a position that youre very conservatively reserved but right now you put up a margin and credit costs are almost half of what revenues are in this space i guess my question is this as we roll forward in a slowing economy with likely a little bit lower some rate cuts how does the pl evolve how does it improve from here because can we be expecting credit costs to come in in a slowing economy im just trying to figure out the path forward because it could be impactful if uspb obviously marches to where you need it to be mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah look like i said we do think that there is certainly upside to uspb were looking for that upside in the mediumterm targets that weve set for ourselves youve got to remember that when you look at the quarter and you look at the half frankly that were still in a period where were seeing the normalization of the cost of credit and as i mentioned in the prepared remarks you have kind of a compounding effect of multiple vintages now maturing at the same time thats playing through the pl thats not just true for us thats true for others as well and so wed expect and we are we do believe were seeing some signs of a cresting when you look at delinquencies now and so we would expect that those losses start to normalize and loss rates start to come down as we go towards the medium term at the same time were investing in the business and were looking to see continued growth in volume and on the top line and the combination of those things as we drive towards the medium term will help us to deliver both the top line growth and certainly improve returns from where we sit today and in line with what weve guided to so its a combination of top line performance from volume and obviously the environment plays into that but we feel like weve got a reasonable assumption around top line growth there cost of credit normalizing continued discipline on the expense line allowing for us to get improved returns across that uspb business glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay appreciate all that one quickie on dcm you had amazingly good performance theres been plenty of conversation about pull forward this year on just refi driving like three quarters of the activity could you just help us think through the second half when thinking about dcm just to make sure that we dont like start indiscernible into perpetuity jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look i think when we think about the back half of were going to see a different mix of activity in banking we do still expect demand to be quite strong across our capital market products because youve got a wall of maturing debt securities coming up in the second half that carry on for a couple of years but we did see some clients accelerating issuances into the first half getting ahead of potential market volatility citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 so if you put it all together i think we expect the rate environment and the financing markets to continue to be accommodative as well as to continue deal making with ma being a bit larger in the overall mix although some of the regulatory elements have put a damper on part of that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah only thing id add to that is look the wallet for the year is obviously going to depend on a couple things so one the return of a more normalized ipo market two the direction and volatility of interest rates the ongoing global conflicts that were all kind of seeing and witnessing and then finally as jane mentioned in her remarks the elections and what those outcomes look like not just in the us but abroad and so there are a number of factors there that will play to the wallet but as we said we believe were wellpositioned to be there to serve our clients and to do so in a way that makes good economic sense operator the next question is from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is now open please go ahead jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning just mark maybe on nii down almost yearoveryear seems a little bit more than the guidance was down modestly for the year so can you discuss sort of the puts and takes this quarter and how we should think about the quarterly trajectory for the rest of the year mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so id say a couple things so one as i mentioned in the quarter and you see it on slide exmarkets were down about thats largely driven by some fx translation that played through but also some seasonally lower revolving card balances and then lower interest rates in argentina and what that is is in argentina we have capital there the policy rate was adjusted downward and as that happened we obviously earned less on that capital that flows through the nii line as i think about the back half of the year and the guidance we have of modestly down there are a couple of puts and takes to keep in mind so one is going to be rates right so as i think about the higher yield that we can earn on reinvestment that will be a tailwind that plays through from an nii point of view the second would be volume growth particularly in our card loans portfolio and we do expect to see continued volume growth across certainly the branded portfolio and so that will be another tailwind for us on the nii line in terms of the headwinds youve got the lower nii earned in argentina from rates that will continue to play through weve got assumed higher average betas in specifically on the nonus side we still have in our forecast the impact of cfpb late fees so assuming that that goes into effect for this year that will have an impact and its in the forecast and then the impact of lost nii from the exits that we have and so the combination of those things will probably mean that nii in the back half of the year is a little bit higher than the first half but again consistent with the guidance that we gave of modestly down jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thats helpful and maybe just quickly kind of a similar question on expenses better than expected this quarter but there was no restructuring or repositioning charges i think to get to the high end of your range youd have to citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 be up a little bit in the back half from run rate is that because you expect more repositioning restructuring in the second half or maybe just talk through expense trajectory from here mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so thats right when i talked about it the first quarter i talked about kind of a downward trend for each of the quarters after q1 the second quarter came in a bit lower than we were expecting im sticking with the guidance and it does mean that the back half of the year will likely come in will come in higher than the second quarter thats a combination of a couple of things including the pace of hiring and investment that we will do in the transformation work that has to be done it also includes repositioning charges that we might take or need to take as we continue to work through our businesses across the firm and the franchise and then the second quarter did or yeah the second quarter did have a onetime or so and some delayed spending that will pick up in the third and fourth quarter around advertising and marketing and some of the other line items so yes the second quarter the third and fourth quarter the back half will be higher than the second quarter but consistent with the guidance that ive given operator the next question is from erika najarian with ubs your line is now open please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi i had two questions and ill ask the first one on expenses first since its a good followup to the previous mark just to clarify lets just say take the highest end of your range at billion just trying to think about how consensus will move so we take that billion and then add the million of fdic expenses yeartodate so far and add the civil money penalties of million so that gets us to billion for the year and any other repositioning charges in the second half of the year would already be included in the billion mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so yes the answer to the last part of your question is yes so in the range that ive given billion to billion that includes our estimate for the full year of repositioning and any restructuring charges that range excludes the fdic special assessment that we saw earlier in the year and it excludes the cmp of million erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for jane and im sure youre getting tired of the question on capital return so youre buying back billion you plan to buy back billion this quarter it looks like you didnt buy back any in the second quarter and im asking this question in this context because consensus has a buyback of nearly billion in the fourth quarter and staying at this rate for the first half of next year and ramping higher and i guess is the billion number a catchup pace because you didnt buy back any in the second quarter and i fully appreciate that you also have the banamex ipo coming which is different from peers that are also waiting for basel clarification but im just wondering do we need to wait for that banamex ipo for the company to feel comfortable moving away from that quartertoquarter guidance and also of course i just want to readdress the beginning of the question when i asked specifically about the pace citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc okay so we are not going to be giving guidance going forward around our buybacks we are going to continue to give quarterly and make it a quarterly determination as to the level and a lot of that is to do with the uncertainty about the forthcoming regulatory changes i think we were delighted to see a slight reduction in our stress capital buffer reflecting the financial strength and resiliency of our business model and also good to see the benefits of our strategy playing out but with the regulatory changes uncertain thats one of the major factors for us to continue with the quarterly guidance mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thats right and on the first part of your question erika id say look we were in discussions with our regulators and we made a prudent call as it relates to buybacks in the quarter for q2 so q3 as we talked about would be at billion and that should not be necessarily viewed as a run rate level as jane mentioned well take it quarter by quarter from here operator the next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi jane hi mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc mark regarding the comments you made about the higher credit losses the three factors that you gave us can you also talk about if this was a factor at all for you folks was there any fico score inflation back during the pandemic that might be playing into these kind of credit losses and as part of the credit card question you mentioned the cfpb the fees that you have factored in the lower fees you factored that into your forwardlook where do we stand on that do you guys have any color on that as well mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah so on the first part of the question look we all kind of have talked about in the past the prospect of fico inflation back during the covid period of time weve been very focused on ensuring that acquisitions that weve made have been appropriately kind of analyzed in the underwriting of that to get comfortable with the quality of new customers that weve been bringing on in light of the environment we have looked at moving towards higher fico scores for new account acquisitions but as i think about what were seeing now there is that dichotomy that i mentioned where we have the higher fico score customers that are driving the spend growth and that frankly have still continued strong balances and savings and its really the lower fico band customers where were seeing the sharper drop in payment rates and citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 more borrowing and so the fico inflation has effectively kind of fizzled out when we look at the mix and dynamic of the customer portfolio that we have at this point in terms of the cfpb late fees well i dont have an update on that like i said weve built in an assumption in our forecast but in terms of the timing i dont have a formal update on the certainty of it operator the next question is from ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning hey mark talking about the nii outlook and the fact that now weve got a little bit of a discrepancy starting between us rates maybe higher for longer and then the beginnings of some of the nonus curve starting to at least put fourth their first cut i know weve got that good chart that you have in the qs about the relative contributions can you just help us understand a little bit of like just generally how youre thinking through that discrepancy and how that informs the difference between usrelated nii and nonusrelated nii as you go forward mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah thank you so look i think that as we look at it out through the certainly through the medium term we expect to see continued nii growth at obviously a modest level certainly lower than what weve seen historically and thats in large part because or in part i should say because of how weve been managing the balance sheet and that has allowed for us to reinvest as securities have rolled off and earn a higher yield on them relative to what we were earning in some instances they were fiveyear terms on some of these investments and so we still think theres some upside from a reinvestment point of view the point you make around kind of nonus dollar or us rates kind of coming off thatll play through a little bit as we think about the beta increases that were expecting outside of the us and so weve assumed that we have higher betas pick up outside of the us if rates kind of come off in a more substantive way then we could see kind of a little less nii pressure than were forecasting there but netnet as i think about the combination of volume growth that were expecting between loans and deposits over that medium term the higher yield we can earn on our assets combined with the pricing capabilities that we have across the portfolio offsetting some of that beta we believe well have continued nii growth as i think about what i often point to in terms of the ire analysis and you have to remember that that is a shock to the current balance sheet and it assumes that the full curve is moving simultaneously cross currencies and in that case the basis point parallel shift downward would be a negative billion with about billion coming from nonus dollar but again that does assume that all of those currencies come down at the same time and doesnt account for the rebalancing of the balance sheet and things that i mentioned like the reinvestment higher yields that wed be able to earn ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and just one followup on the occ amendment and thats specifically related to the resource review plan do you have a line of sight on how long thatll take you guys to finish because it seems like and is that what we should be thinking about in terms of just understanding like what the side of what you need to get done in terms of the other language thats written in the order citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc so ken look the resource review plan is just that its a plan to ensure that we have sufficient resources allocated towards achieving a timely and sustainable compliance to the order essentially if an area is delayed or looking as if it could be well determine what additional resourcing if any is required to get back on track and then well share that with the occ in a more formalized way than we do today and we obviously review this pretty constantly ourselves were already working on the plan after its finalized with the occ ph so it will be confidential supervisory information that we cant disclose so we wont be able to tell you that the plan is what the nature of the plan is going to be but it wont be much more complicated than what we talked about and were expecting to get it were not expecting this to take long operator the next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is now open please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc hello jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so i know we talked a lot about expenses i just have one kind of overarching question here which is on how we should think about the path of expenses between now and the medium term as we have come quite a long way in the simplification process maybe if you could give us a sense as to how far along simplification impact on expenses we are and overlapping with the regulatory requirements do these net out or are we skewed a little bit more towards requirements being a bit heavier than whats left on simplification from here thanks mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc so thank you betsy i guess id say a couple things so i think we said it in the past so the target for the medium term we think is somewhere around billion to billion of expenses as weve said well have about billion in savings related to the restructuring that weve done and another million to billion related to net expense reductions from eliminating the stranded costs as well as additional productivity over that mediumterm period citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 and so weve made i think very good headway as jane has mentioned in the org simplification and the restructuring charges associated with that those saves will have started to generate some of those saves in the early part of that meaning this year will likely be offset by continued investment that were making in areas of the business like transformation but also in businessled or driven growth and you should expect in terms of the trend that we would have a downward trend towards in achieving that range jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and i just want to reiterate we remain confident that we will meet our to rotce target over the medium term and weve got the we have the ability to manage the different elements weve been talking about today making sure that were investing sufficient resources into the transformation so we can be on track with that as well as in our businesses as well as the return of capital to our shareholders so we feel confident around that and good about it we can manage this mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think thats a great point jane look the reality is as was pointed out earlier we spent about billion last year a little bit under that on the transformationrelated work and the plan has called for us to spend a little bit more than that this year and frankly in the first half of the year as we work through the transformation work and some of the things that jane and i have mentioned earlier in the year that weve been focused on like data and data related to regulatory reporting weve had to spend more than we had planned for in the first half right and weve done that and we funded that weve been able to find productivity opportunities that allow for us to still stay within the guidance that weve given for the full year so we are managing this entire expense base right so not the whole billion plus of it we are actively managing that with an eye towards whats required from a transformation point of view to keep it on track to accelerate in areas where were behind and to shore up areas where were tracking in accordance to what the order requires and where are the other inefficiencies that can allow for us to free up the expense base and so things like the work that andy sieg has done with the finance team around that expense base and finding efficiencies there are opportunities that weve been able to tease out of the business things that we have done in parts of uspb and that we have continued to get after in parts of banking which you see in the down this quarter are areas where weve been keenly focused on where are there duplicative roles where are there inefficient processes that we can actually drive greater efficiency out of so longwinded way of saying we understand the expense guidance that weve given we also understand and stress the importance of funding the transformation with whats required and were doing both betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you very much appreciate that operator the next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 hi let me just clarify this mark and jane just to make sure that we all have it right the billion to billion does not include anything thus far on what you think you may need to spend on the resource review plan meaning what additional resources you would have to put to fix the consent order am i right there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc no youre not right so i think as youve heard us talk about vivek for a while now that we knew the areas that we were behind in our elements of our transformation program and that we began addressing those and making the investments some of thats in people some of that is in technology spend its using different tools and capabilities to get areas addressed earlier and we began that earlier in the year and you saw that acknowledged as well by our regulators who pointed to the fact that weve already begun addressing the areas that were behind mark mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thats right jane and what you have heard is that despite having to spend more some million or so more were not changing the guidance right and so we have as jane mentioned we have worked on areas already that weve needed to and we have looked for ways to absorb that and are doing so within our guidance vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so going forward even though this plan is still to be sort of put together and approved by the regulators we should not expect any change to this expense mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc look the plan the resource review plan as jane mentioned is what were working through now with the regulators that will be a process for demonstrating to them that we are spending and allocating the appropriate resources to accomplishing the commitments that we have appropriate resources can range from people to technology to enhancing our processes and ensuring better execution if you think about what that will entail it will entail areas where we are delayed or behind as we identify those areas being able to tease out the root cause of any delay and ensure that weve got proper funding allocated to get it back on track and thats me framing out how i think about what something like this might look like and so what were saying is that if we identify issues in the quarters to come that we havent identified already thats the process were going to apply to those issues and as youve heard us say repeatedly were going to spend whatever is necessary to then get those things back on track and as weve done thus far this year were going to look for opportunities to absorb those headwinds i hope thats clear operator the next question is from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is now open please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 hi apologies if i missed it in the opening remarks but what drove the decline in credit card revenues from to it looks like they were down about in aggregate even though average loans went up spending went up what was the driver of that mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc credit card revenues seasonality jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah seasonality mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc seasonality playing through there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc sequentially mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah sequentially yeah jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think if you look yearoveryear youll be able to see a pretty common trend there the consumer is slowing in some of the in the spend as mark had referred to matt but and a lot of the spending and the growth areas we are seeing and the underlying numbers is being driven by the affluent customer mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think theres also the dynamic on the crs of the reward across the portfolio of rewards playing through from one quarter to the other so the combination of those things are playing through the revenue line there jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc but nothing thats particularly worrying us matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately on the very early kind of part of the prepared remarks you talked about the dividends being capped in terms of what could be upstream from the bank to the holding company because of the occ came out this week for all intents and purposes like does that impact how you run the company or subsidiary or impact liquidity or capital i understood the comment no change to dividends or buybacks at the holding company but is there any impact from that that we would notice on the outside thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look lets be clear this action does not impact our ability to return capital to our shareholders the dividends that are referenced are just intercompany payments from cbna to the parent so first of all dont confuse what a dividend is here its not going to impact how we run the company the subsidiary the capital the liquidity at all and the dividends are not capped mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah i think jane thats right and i think lets not lose sight of the purpose of the orders that are there and the purpose of the orders that are there are to ensure that were funding and allocating the effort appropriately right so the regulators want essentially the same thing we want right is for us to get this done right and so that is the primary objective the reference to the dividending from out of cbna up to the parent is certainly referenced there between now and establishing that resource review plan but as jane mentions that does not constrain the parent from doing the things that it will need to do and as opposed to its not a cap what it is is that anything above the debt service of the parent or the preferred dividends and other nondiscretionary obligations would require a nonobjection from the occ jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc until the resource plan is agreed mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc until the resource plan is agreed jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and as youll have seen the resource plan needs to be submitted within days and as i indicated were working on that one and not anticipating that to be a problem operator the next question is from saul martinez with hsbc your line is now open please go ahead saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hi good afternoon thanks for taking my question just i guess i just want to follow up on the latter question i just want to be very clear so what youre saying is that the requirement that cbna receive a nonobjection before dividending upstream to the parent that does not impact how you think about your capital flexibility how you think about it doesnt restrict you in any way and shouldnt impact for example your ability to benefit from for example a basel endgame rule that softened or some of the benefits mark that you talked about in terms of simplification so you dont see this impacting your ongoing level of capital flexibility and your ability to repurchase stock going forward if some of these things actually do play out citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc no saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc indiscernible okay mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc no i dont right saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc fair enough that was as clear as can be mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc thank you saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc second question on i just want to follow up on uspb i mean i still i get the point that youre seeing a normalization in losses in cards but even if i adjust for reserve builds your rotce is still singledigits i would think even at these ncl levels your cards business is pretty profitable youre a scale player youre above sort of prepandemic levels but not i dont know if i it doesnt seem like its that much higher by a dramatic amount it would seem to imply that the retail bank is a huge drag on profitability even maybe even losing money i dont know but can you just talk about what you can do to sort of improve the retail bank profitability and just give any more color that you can in terms of the path to get to that highteen rotce you talked about jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah let me kick off there and lets say look clearly were very focused on improving the returns in uspb to get us to the highteens level over the medium term and youve seen us generating healthy positive operating leverage this quarter weve had a number of quarters of good revenue growth and as mark said were at the low point of the credit cycle and we knew this year we would see the pressure on returns from the elevated ncls and some of the industry headwinds weve talked about but as the ncl rates approach steadystate levels and the mitigating actions that all of us have been putting in place against the industry headwinds as those take hold we expect the returns will improve and support the firmwide medium term targets in the retail bank we are continuing to focus on growing share in our fixed core markets and were doing that leveraging our physical and digital assets it plays an important role in enabling the wealth continuum and the growth that we are looking at in our wealth franchise we are continuing to improve our operating efficiency citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 being very disciplined in expense management and managing carefully the branch and digital productivity of the retail bank network but were at the high point of the credit cycle its driving the low point for uspb and as i said in my remarks were expecting to see those returns improve from here operator the next question is from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good afternoon so mark i have a fairly technical question on dta utilization and specifically the nols the deduction is still fairly significant at billion it roughly equates to about of your market cap and the good news here i suppose is that it should come back into capital over time but weve seen very little utilization over the past two years despite the firm being profitable and so wanted to better understand this whats constraining your ability to utilize those dtas and are there catalysts on the horizon that could help accelerate that utilization beyond organic earnings generation mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yes thank you so im going to give you a very simple answer to a very complicated question it really comes down to driving us income right and so we are focused on not just all of the things that weve mentioned but driving higher income in the us that allows for us to utilize the disallowed dta we saw some of that in the quarter and we expect to see more of it as we move through the medium term but that is the major driver of that utilization jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc and we have many of our business heads very much focused around that opportunity as well so winning in the us is a very important leg for example of the strategy ph that this is refreshing similarly we see opportunities from the commercial bank we see it in wealth we see it in obviously in us personal banking and in services so were very were focused from a business strategy point of view on this not just from the financial side steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thank you both for that color maybe just a quick followup just on the retail services business we are seeing some evidence that your competitors in this space have been more aggressive leading with price in an effort to win some new mandates and was hoping you could just speak to what youre seeing across the competitor set and your appetite or willingness to potentially offer better economics in response to increased competition from some of your peers jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i think youll be delighted to hear that were very focused on returns rather than just on revenues so when we enter into discussions with a partner who may be a new rfp for their portfolio or looking at new ones such as the one we just agreed with dillards its all about the returns and the profile of the business rather than the revenue citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 side of things and its a shift probably from some other ways in the past but im very pleased with how disciplined the team is being around this and were seeing the benefits of it mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc yeah and that may be different from what you hear and see from other players in the space but as jane mentioned were keenly focused on ensuring that yes we have a good partnership but that were generating an appropriate return thats part of achieving our mediumterm targets and as you know since you brought up retail cards i mean when we think about how cecl works and the reserves you have to establish for these partnerships were establishing full lifetime reserves thats on the balance sheet where ultimately we end up splitting those through the partner sharing economics so its another important consideration as we think about expanding and taking on these relationships and renegotiating partnerships to making sure that returns make good sense for us jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah and mark and i have no problem saying no to revenue that doesnt come at the right return and being very disciplined around that operator the next question is from vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is now open please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi sorry just to follow up on this whole consent order stuff jane what do you think this does in terms of timing how much longer for you to sort of get this past you are you talking couple of years is it now longer by a year any sense of that any sense of helping us think through that jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc look in terms of the consent order and the areas weve had delays there are four areas to the consent order its risk management its data governance its around compliance and its around control as weve said we were falling behind in certain areas related to data and weve been investing to address the areas that we were behind we also saw an increase in the scope related to regulatory reporting so we added some more bodies of work there and were well underway so we are not expecting this to extend the original expectations that we have on when we will complete the body of work for the consent order we have a target states for the different areas of it we have the plan to achieve those target states well make the investments necessary to ensure that we do so well try and get this done as quickly but as robustly as possible and were doing this by making strategic fixes and investments rather than what i would call the old citi way which is a series of bandaids that remediate but dont actually fix the underlying issue and that way we are delivering for our shareholders as well as our regulators and our clients because were putting in strategic solutions that will benefit all but im not expecting this to change the timeframes vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 operator the final question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just two clarifications so this is a very high profile amendment to the consent order and i think what i hear you saying that if you can confirm your risk compliance and controls are getting passing grade its really the data and as it relates to the data youre talking about regulatory reports some which had lines of data is that really the scope of what you need to fix because people see this externally and say hey youre failing in terms of overall controls and resiliency but i think i hear you saying its really more about just the data and the regulatory reporting which is important but more of a slice of a broader picture is that correct jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc yeah mike maybe i just maybe i youre asking a great and its an important question so maybe i try and explain what the data elements because its an area that mark and i have pointed to so first of all we use data all over the firm we use it to deliver million customer statements every month our corporate clients as you heard about at our service investor day access account data realtime across multiple countries on citidirect and were moving trillion roughly per day for those clients around the world we trade billions of dollars in a millisecond on our trading platforms we can see our liquidity positions realtime around the world this can only be done if youve got pretty pristine data and highly automated ecosystems so but what is the transformation doing what it is doing is simplifying how data moves through the firm and its about upgrading the management and governance over those flows and as ive said were doing a strategic overhaul of large parts of our infrastructure so what are we doing were making sure were capturing data accurately using smart tools and automation well often talk about this smart system makes sure theres no errors when we book a trade weve seen our error rate down as a result of it were housing our upstream data in two standardized repositories theyre the golden sources an in person data hub which youve heard me talk about a few times and theyre a golden source now for all of the downstream data use populating the thousands of regulatory reports mark talked about and other areas and what a single repository means is that the data models the data quality rules the controls you put in place that govern and manage that data they all sit in one place rather than being distributed all over the firm as they have been historically marks been investing in building a standardized reporting infrastructure youve heard us talk about a single full suite reporting ledger versus the six or so reporting ledgers that we had in the past and were delivering all of this through consolidated systems through the automation and streamlining of data flows so instead of being in multiple pipes the flows go through single pipes so its a sorry to get a bit plumber on you for a moment but i think it is important to understand what it is because its a lot of work its a strategic overhaul its not a series of tactical fixes where were behind as we do the work on data we identify specific issues we need to fix as we execute the plan that we have in place theres some more areas to address and we knew back when we did the plan and weve also accelerated the work on improving the accuracy of our regulatory reports and we increased the scope of this work as well its more comprehensive than originally planned citigroup inc c corrected transcript q2 earnings call 12jul2024 so what were doing were adding resources and data experts were learning from best practices and were using some great ai and other data tools that are helping to identify anomalies in data and data flows much quickly were also to some of the culture side were learning from pilots how do we accelerate broader deployment at scale across the firm in a consistent enterprisewide manner so all of these things in the data side are going to enable us to leapfrog competitors more revenue opportunities better client service fewer buffers drive more efficiencies and hope at the end the end goal here is it becomes a competitive advantage for the firm that is the data plan clearly theres a very important element of it related to the consent orders were behind in a few areas were investing weve already begun that investment as mark and ive talked about to get it done well get it done mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc the only thing id mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then real short followup mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc sorry what was that mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah just to say real short followup to that so youre doing all this great stuff but you still fell short just in like one sentence despite doing all of this great stuff that you described the regulator still said you didnt get it done why after doing all that didnt you get it done in the eyes of the regulators and why will it be fixed now just like a one sentence explanation for that if you have it jane nind fraser a chief executive officer director citigroup inc i always said that a transformation of this magnitude over multiple years would not be linear we have many steps forward we have setbacks we adjust we learn from them we move forward and we get back on track mark a l mason a chief financial officer citigroup inc and mike if i could just put one number into context because you played back the which was a number of global regulatory reports across the landscape here there are probably to that are core us reports that are pivotal to our us regulators and a lot of what were discussing here is about ensuring that were prioritizing the data that impacts those to reports as we work through this operator there are no further questions ill now turn the call over to jen landis for closing remarks citigroup inc c
