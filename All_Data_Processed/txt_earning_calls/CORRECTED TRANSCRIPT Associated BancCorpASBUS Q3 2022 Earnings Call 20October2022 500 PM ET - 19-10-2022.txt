associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well thank you and good afternoon everyone welcome to our third quarter earnings call im andy harmening and im joined here today by derek meyer our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer id like to start things off by sharing a few highlights from the quarter and providing a quick update on our strategic initiatives from there derek will walk through the update on margins income statement trends and capital and then pat will round us out with an update on credit in the past months since ive joined associated bank we have been building a digitalforward growthfocused strategic path for the company that also plays to our foundational strengths as we continue to execute against our plan weve demonstrated an ability to drive positive operating leverage improve our roatce and serve our customers more efficiently and effectively weve seen promising momentum on several fronts since march of weve expanded our commercial rm team by these highquality additions have helped us drive added loan volume in focused markets like milwaukee and chicago but theyre also helping us drive a full banking relationship that includes deposits and services such as treasury management weve added over billion in highquality auto loans under our prime superprime strategy and we have consistent growth in our new assetbased lending and equipment finance verticals giving us additional leverage to drive balanced loan growth and last month we officially launched the most significant digital upgrade in our companys history with our new digital platform this represents a big step forward for our customer experience but in many ways were just getting started here we expect to make regular upgrades going forward with the first enhancements on track for implementation by yearend in fact by the end of this month empowering us to further expand capabilities and deepen relationships with our customers were pleased with the momentum weve seen so far and were equally committed as ever to maintaining our discipline around credit quality and expense management these foundational strengths have been developed over the course of a decade and will continue to serve as our foundation as we look to deliver enhanced value for all of our stakeholders turning to the current environment we have experienced the strength and resilience in our core midwestern markets while unemployment rates have ticked up slightly in recent months states like wisconsin and minnesota remain well below the national average the consumer remains healthy while our business customers continue to pursue growth and expansion opportunities with an increasing awareness of the uncertain macro environment last quarter we talked about commercial line utilization trends normalizing for the first time in over two years this trend has continued in the fall and our customers are actually running slightly above historical average as they continue to grow and expand on the consumer front the housing market has cooled due to high interest rates but this environment has allowed us to retain more mortgages on our balance sheet weve also seen steady activity in our home equity and auto portfolios but despite this steady consumer borrowing activity and healthy consumer spending our consumer deposit balances grew again during the quarter taken together with the implementation of our initiatives these trends have allowed us to enjoy another strong quarter here in q3 we view this as both a reflection of the health and stability of our core markets as well as a sign that our initiatives are resonating in these core markets associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 as we look towards the remainder of the year in significant macroeconomic and geopolitical question marks remain but we put ourselves in a good position to support our customers and drive our stakeholders without stretching to take additional risk with that id like to highlight a few items outlined on slide our third quarter results reflected strong loan and deposit growth expanding margins and stable credit amid the continued strength in our markets the execution of our initiatives and the impact of rising rates on our assetsensitive balance sheet our total net interest income increased from the prior quarter and yearoveryear total revenue growth outpaced expense growth by a wide margin allowing us to deliver positive operating leverage and returns on tangible common equity north of for the quarter as mentioned we also continue to see stability on the credit side which saw just basis points of net chargeoffs in q3 we did add to our loan loss provision during the quarter but this was largely driven by the significant loan volume as evidenced by our acll rate ratio which held firm at quarteroverquarter now let me give a little bit more color on our loan dynamics slide helps us underscore the broadbased diversified nature of the loan growth story in as was the case in q2 we reported growth in nearly every major loan vertical here in the third quarter residential mortgage led the way as we retained more loans on our balance sheet in the rising rate environment but we also posted significant growth in several buckets within our core cre consumer and commercial lines of business this broadbased growth reflects the strength of our franchise but it also highlights the diversifying nature of our initiatives this gives us additional levers to pull when we need to drive balanced diversified growth across the portfolio over time without feeling like we need to stretch on credit in any area as we move to slide weve been able to make significant progress against our initiative loan targets in in fact as of september weve already passed our yearend target for core commercial loan growth and are well on track to either meet or exceed targets we set for our new abl equipment finance and auto verticals with respect to core commercial the growth of our rm base normalization of line utilization trends and strong loan demand have combined to more than offset the moderation we expected from ppp and mortgage warehouse throughout the year allowing us to surpass our yearend target by september while we do not expect to maintain this pace of growth in q4 pipelines do remain healthy and we do expect to see some growth continue into the yearend our new abl and equipment finance verticals have also gained momentum throughout the year as each team is fully staffed and continues to develop their respective plans we remain confident in our ability to hit the million combined target we set for the end of the year turning to consumer lending the auto team has continued to produce very highquality loans that help diversify our consumer book as i mentioned last quarter this team joined associated a little over a year ago but theyre by no means new to the auto industry theyve decades of experience in a prime superprime strategy in a variety of environments and im confident of the teams ability to hit their billion target by yearend but im just as confident that theyre going to get there responsibly without stretching on credit we also continue to expect residential mortgage balances to remain relatively stable through the end of the year as ive stated the loan growth weve seen in has been driven by the resilience of our core customers and associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 disciplined execution of our strategic plan this gives us a stronger balance sheet in the short term but it also gives us more flexibility to pursue highquality lending opportunities across the spectrum of business units over the long term without abandoning the credit discipline weve established over the past years now turning to slide we highlight our deposit trends for the third quarter despite inflation and increased competition in the market were pleased to see our deposits grew at an almost annualized rate versus the prior quarter this deposit growth has not come by accident in fact its been driven by several strategic actions weve taken over time to set ourselves up for success first weve cultivated a low cost granular deposit over time by focusing on deepening relationships with customers in our markets this has led to a high degree of resilience and stability in our base and has limited our post covid surge outflows to date second while ive been pleased with the loan growth weve seen from our strategic initiatives the core focus of these initiatives has always been to attract and deepen holistic relationships on the commercial side in particular our efforts to grow our relationship manager base and move to a balanced scorecard model have already resulted in significant deposit inflows here in the fall and third while much of the growth thus far has been on the commercial side we also have several consumer focused strategies already in flight that are expected to bolster our deposit gathering efforts going into examples include our new mass affluent strategy targeting a high potential segment of customers with up to million in investable assets and our new digital platform which will fill a gap allowing us to increase acquisition retention and deepening across consumer and business banking weve recognized that generating lowcost funding is more crucial now than ever particularly as we look to fund our growth strategies on the lending side based on initiatives in play we feel confident in our ability to fund the bank at a reasonable cost in and beyond on slide we show a five quarter trend of our ptpp as you can see our strong revenue trends and diligent management of expenses have combined to deliver operating significant operating leverage growth in we remain on track to deliver positive operating leverage in the final quarter of as well so let me pause there im going to hand it over to derek meyer our chief financial officer to provide further detail on our margin revenue and income statement trends for the quarter derek derek meyer chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks andy slide highlights our asset sensitivity and our ability to manage funding costs in the current rising rate cycle on the asset side average earning asset yields have increased significantly in most key categories over the course of the year through september earning asset yields have increased by basis points or roughly of the increase weve seen in fed funds target rate over the same period reflecting our core asset sensitivity on the liability side yeartodate interest bearing liability costs have now decreased increased by basis points or roughly of the move in fed funds target we continue to lag on funding costs that ph raised rise and continue to see our margin expand accordingly throughout the year slide helps us to quantify the acceleration in margin expansion weve seen in recent quarters as a result of recent loan growth and our structural asset sensitivity during q3 our net interest margin expanded by basis points versus the prior quarter and on an nii basis this expansion equated to a million lift to revenue for the quarter associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 as we get into the homestretch of we now expect shortterm interest rates to rise by basis points following the federal open market committee meeting in november and expect a 50basis point increase following the fomcs december meeting based on these assumptions we now expect our net interest income to exceed million moving to slide we recently discussed several factors that have positioned us to benefit from the current rising rate environment these factors include our sizeable portfolio of variable rate loans our reduced reliance on wholesale network funding and our ability to lag on deposit betas due to our low cost granular deposit base we expect to continue benefiting from these dynamics in the near term with that said we also recognized that the macroeconomic forecast carries significant uncertainty as we look into and beyond in order to start managing through this uncertainty and began reducing our interest rate risk we executed million of interest rate swaps this quarter while we dont expect to determine when interest rates will peak we do expect to take modest steps over time to continue managing down managing our downside interest rate risk shifting to slide noninterest income remains pressured by the mortgage banking and service charge headwinds weve discussed previously in the third quarter modest increases in card based fees and other fee based revenues partially offset reductions in mortgage banking service charges and wealth management fees as a reminder we expect to see deposit account fee income moderate beginning in the third quarter based on the implementation of the od nsf changes we announced earlier this year also driven by rising rates mortgage banking revenue continued to moderate during the third quarter million of our q3 noninterest income was driven by an investment securities gain that allowed us to make contribution to our charitable foundation as we help strengthen the communities we serve moving to slide third quarter expenses came in at million with million of the expense driven by the contribution to our charitable foundation yeartodate expenses have grown by versus the first nine months of consistent with our prior guidance weve continued to scale up investments in people and technology but remain committed to keeping expense growth below revenue growth elsewhere our efficiency ratio continued to improve in the third quarter on an fte basis weve now decreased our efficiency ratio by approximately basis points as compared to the same period last year which reflects our ability to maintain expense discipline while driving higher revenues we now expect total noninterest expense of approximately million to million for moving to slide capital levels have been managed near the lower end of our range as we continue to support customer loan growth nonetheless we remain comfortable with our capital levels given our enhanced profitability profile in given current market conditions and the expectation for shortterm rates to remain elevated in q4 we now expect tce to end the year in the to range we continue to expect cet1 to end the year between and ill now hand it over to our chief credit officer pat ahern to provide an update on credit quality patrick e ahern chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks derek id like to start by providing an update on our allowance as shown on slide weve utilized the moodys august baseline forecast for our cecl forwardlooking assumptions the moodys baseline associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 forecast remains fairly consistent with recent trends and assumes increasing fed rate actions and minimal covid impact on a dollar basis acll at september settled at million while this figure represents a million increase from q2 the build was largely driven by significant growth in our loan portfolios this dynamic is more clearly reflected in our ratio of reserves to loans which has held flat at during the quarter on slide we highlight our quarterly credit trends overall credit metrics remained stable throughout the third quarter while nonperforming assets and nonaccrual loans increased slightly from the prior quarter they remain down and respectively from the same period a year ago delinquencies a leading indicator of potential problem loans were held flat at basis points at quarter end while our yeartodate net charge offs have been just following a net zero provision in the prior quarter and five consecutive net reserve releases prior to that we added million of provision in the third quarter as mentioned this provision build was largely a function of loan growth and was not a reflection of credit quality concerns within our portfolio as weve discussed previously the recent growth in our loan portfolios has been driven by investing in our core business growing our core relationships and expanding our engagement with customer segments with which we are very familiar weve spent more than a decade bolstering the credit foundation of associated with a disciplined underwriting culture and a focus on quality with that said we are fully aware of the warning signs in the economy and we remain stringent in our portfolio management with underwriting reflecting elevated inflation supply chain disruption and labor costs to name just a few economic concerns as well as continued interest rate sensitivity analysis across all lines of business going forward we expect any provision adjustments to reflect changes to risk rates economic conditions loan volumes and other indications of credit quality with that i will now hand it back to andy to share some closing thoughts andrew j harmening president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you pat id like to reiterate a couple of points from our discussion this afternoon on slide first we remain confident in our ability to drive quality loan growth over the remainder of the year while weve technically already achieved our billion in total commercial loan growth target for pipelines remain healthy and we expect to see continued growth between now and yearend next we remain asset sensitive and we expect to continue benefiting from the rising rate environment in the near term we now anticipate a 75basis point increase in novembers fomc meeting and another 50basis point increase in december as such we expect our full year net interest income to exceed million lastly we continue to invest strategically in our initiatives and now expect between million and million of noninterest expense in with that said we will remain disciplined on expenses as we work to continue delivering positive operating leverage in future quarters with that lets open it up for questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question today is coming from jared shaw from wells fargo your line is now live hello jared perhaps your phone is on mute please pick up your handset timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon sorry about that this is timur braziler filling in for jared how are you guys andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc so maybe just starting a little bit more broadly weve heard some other banks today talk about economic activity slowing in their markets particularly in the second half of the quarter clearly that doesnt seem to be the case for you guys maybe just talk of what youre hearing more broadly from your client base how those conversations have progressed throughout the quarter and whether or not youre seeing any kind of signs of caution from them looking to extend borrowings build operations whatever may be the case andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well look i think it actually would be the same answer from us we look at the second quarter and we had record growth of about billion pointtopoint the third quarter benefited an average loan growth as a result of that second quarter but we saw pointtopoint growth slow i believe is right around billion so its a matter of scale there what i would say is we have seen commercial pipelines peak midyear and they do seem to be managing down a little bit however theyre still on pace something close to where they were in the first quarter so its hard to determine what the final trend is here what is seasonal and what is a trend but we have seen a little bit of dampening and we expect that to continue when we look at increasing our underwriting variables interest rate underwriting variables that inherently could dampen a pipeline as we go forward when youre looking at a deal perhaps a customer needs to put a little bit more money in or theyre maybe not wanting to do that on the commercial side it can also change the cash flow assumptions in the credit so its not a falling off a cliff as much as a dampening situation for us weve been able to maintain some diversified growth because weve had some strategic initiatives heading into this point in time but we are hearing and seeing some discussion of that and then from a final perspective ill say that particularly in wisconsin and minnesota the economies have remained pretty strong with regards to being heavily manufacturing influence and that being a pretty strong place in the market the other piece is unemployment remained extremely low in those two markets for the time being so part of it is initiatives we have seen some dampening and part of it is resilience of the midwest markets that we are in associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats good color thanks maybe switching to the deposit side are you able to parse out what portion of the deposit growth in the quarter is coming from the new lending initiatives and then as a corollary to that just given the continued build out and the growth in those lending initiatives are you able to kind of buck broader industry trends in both growing and maintaining deposit balances or do you think youll succumb to some of the same industry pressures that weve seen elsewhere andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah let me answer the first part of that and ill turn it over to derek for the or im going to answer the second part first and then turn it over to derek for the other piece clearly the initiatives that weve had going on for quite some time are having a positive impact for us so what were able to do can you how much can you say is strictly from adding an rm well when you see your treasury management sales go up by yearoveryear you get a pretty good idea that youre talking about liquidity management with the customer thats exactly what weve seen the income from that treasury management is not what changes our income trajectory as much it is the balances that come with that when you create a balanced scorecard that incense them to focus on that a year before you need it you start to see the resulting trends starting to emerge we know on the mass affluent side which were starting training for literally this week and full launch by the end of next month we know that were underindexed in dollars per customer in this mass affluent segment and we know that that segment carries about of the deposits of a consumer bank so in as much as were under indexed getting to average gives us a lift in growth versus the marketplace certainly we will be impacted by the pressures of the marketplace in some way shape or form but coming into this situation we have multiple initiatives in our commercial bank we have multiple initiatives in our consumer bank now i could go through the entire litany but when you think about product enhancements and consumer marketing shift spend change digital acquisition sales process and frankly bringing in a new executives that has expertise in deposit acquisition that was not on accident our new chief marketing and chief product officer has launched many of these products in the past and once launched has gotten traction in those so thats what gives us some optimism in this category heading into but we certainly are impacted by the broader market derek i dont know if you want to take that derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think youve covered all of it the only thing i would add is what we saw on the actual quarter was broad which is what weve suggested in our discussions was broad based through the commercial and cre side of the business across the products both end of period and average balance so you will expect the rest of the initiatives that andy referred indiscernible pull through on the consumer side and carry us through into next year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just last one for me it looks like the asset remix with the new loan production is helping to accelerate nim trends can you disclose what the production rate was in the loan book in the third quarter and associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 then just how should we think about net interest margin once the fed does stop hiking with the continued remix do you see additional nim expansion opportunities pass that point or are we kind of nearing an inflection point with the fed moves derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think the farthest were saying is that were going to continue to remain asset sensitive i think for this year our guidance pretty much lays off what youre likely to expect in terms of further margin expansion you can sort of back into that and then the rest is weve laid out if you look at the table it talks about asset sensitivity thats probably as far as well go laying out how much upside we have which structurally we have quite a bit even though were starting to put in some downside protection so i think thats as far as well take it but we feel very good about it what we are concerned about is as we get into later innings is the fact that we have put a hedging program in place and that well start to leg into that over time to protect us from the downside and thats probably a new strategy that wed like to lay out so that weve got some of this locked in andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp ill also this is andy ill also make another point which is more of a reiteration that we had before which is we see this as a bit of an scurve so you go up and then deposit slowly cash what weve said was in the last rate cycle i believe were around a beta because weve changed the structure of our balance sheet and are about core funded versus wholesale network being about and last time going into the cycle were at wholesale network funded thats what makes us believe that we can keep that beat at about or below through the cycle that hasnt changed its held very true to what were seeing now were seeing some extraordinary increases from the fed unlike many of us have seen in maybe our career in a short period of time and thats why were not giving longterm guidance i think that we stick to the basics of where we are and what were doing and the impact that were seeing so right now its on track to what weve given guidance for in the past timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc understood thanks for the color and congrats on the good quarter andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thank you operator thank you next question is coming from scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now live r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon guys thanks for taking the question i think i wanted to take another stab at that margin question i guess the guidance for the fourth quarter or the full year implies somewhere around million of nii in the fourth quarter so still up but much less of a trajectory than in the last couple of quarters it sounds like associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 there should still be balance sheet growth into the fourth quarter but i think like the million side of the range would imply not much margin expansion in there so i guess maybe sort of the puts and takes off what does it take to get you to the plus side of the million andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well scott thank you for asking that question and making this just continue to be uncomfortable you get mad at us if we miss a number and so we always put a plus at the end of that million we have were well into the fourth quarter we see the trends where we are and we have confidence in the forecast that we have out there we dont want to get ahead of ourselves with understanding what the reactions of the customer base could be when you have a market that is fluctuating the way it is we want to make sure that regardless of our actions for the next two months that we do what we say and so we feel very comfortable with that million i feel very comfortable to put in a plus at the end of that million i dont think i would have a lot more color to that than to tell you that clearly we have had a relationship manager increase of that puts us in a unique position to continue to have growth both on the deposit side and the loan side and so we think well have some growth in the fourth quarter but there are also some things on the longterm side of whats happening with permanent money and the takeout of existing products and so the question on what gets paid off in the fourth quarter is an open question for us so we wanted to make sure we put out a number that we could hit there could be timing of what gets paid off were seeing historically low paydown monthly paydowns on residential which has allowed us to grow and weve seen significant decrease in production so with some of that uncertainty bouncing around on what the payoff side of it is weve put the plus out there we will say that we will expect to grow in the fourth quarter but i wouldnt want to get over my skis on this particular number so id probably leave it at a 935millionplus r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect that context is helpful so it sounds like ph its as base just a very very conservative outlook with hopefully that were on the plus side fairly easily so good i appreciate that andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp we are bankers scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah good point touché and then when we talk about moderating the asset sensitivity maybe a little more color regarding what the ultimate goal is in terms of sensitivity one way or the other and if swaps are sort of the main avenue to get there in your mind how much more might it take to get to where you want to be derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp i think the firms taken the view that we look at the rate of growth and the change of our structural balance sheet first and then we take a look at what kind of hedging we want to put afterwards and we took a first bite at that because we saw that the fixed rate growth was being matched by the variable rate growth of our loan book so associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 as we look out into our guidance for next year which we will put out in january well do that same reevaluation well take a look at what we expect to do structurally with our business and then where the interest rate risk is sitting and then what we can use in our tool bag to manage that and take some of the downside risk off the table so that sort of lays out the process by which were going to make that determination and when were willing to share that impact but i dont see us doing anything esoteric i think we took the first straightforward simple steps that were available and i think most people will understand that and be happy about it r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right wonderful i appreciate the thoughts andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp thanks scott operator thank you next question is coming from chris mcgratty from kbw your line is now live christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good afternoon thanks can you speak to the just the outlook for the loan to deposit ratio remind us the targets and where you see that trending over the next couple of quarters derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah i think weve been shooting to maintain a loan to deposit ratio or less i would say plus or minus or and thats sort of the benchmark we shoot for we got a little on the high end of that this quarter but theres some seasonality involved with that and theres some pull forward of our loan production that we saw and so thats how i would think about it if im in your shoes modeling it as we look out going forward well be pricing our products and our deposit initiatives to keep that balance andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and the other piece of that is not just loan to deposit but we also think about our funding source and weve been trying very hard to keep our core to network and wholesale ratio in line i think youll notice that weve done that in the fourth quarter being in at about an split we talked last quarter somebody said well could that go up and the answer is yes it could go up it could shift for a short period of time it could bulge depending on what asset growth is clearly we saw very large asset growth in the second quarter we saw the asset growth that was strong in the third quarter but decreased and were seeing a pipeline that has slowly decreased as well so our target is still that remain over time in that range as well christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great maybe i missed this but did you provide or could you provide the spot rate for your loan yields and also interestbearing deposit costs associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 derek meyer a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp we have not provided those spot rates weve got the quarterly asset yields i think that are on page of the presentation and i think thats where were going to leave it i think what we did try and lay out was how much asset sensitivity we still have on the loan side and the deposit side on the interestbearing liabilities and i think that sensitivity even though we put the hedging program in place is still relatively high and it still offers lots of upside christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thanks operator thank you next question is coming from terry mcevoy from stephens your line is now live terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everyone andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp good afternoon terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi so first question are all the expected banker hires and the investments youre making in digital are those built into your fourth quarter expense outlook and the reason i ask is im just trying to look ahead into that first quarter and make sure ive got a kind of decent run rate to think about the beginning of next year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah fair question so clearly weve been up significantly in our rms and the way that i answer that question really on that front is that if we have a strong performer that becomes available in the market were going to hire them thats a really valuable commodity in the markets that we serve and so ill put that piece out so we would expect some small level of hiring were not going to see anything similar to what weve seen over the past months we dont need to frankly what weve seen is we brought in talented people and we brought them in throughout the year and as you know terry it takes some period of time to establish that pipeline and relationship at the new company so were still benefiting from those hires and well benefit from those hires throughout without the need to have as significant of investment on that front the way that i look at the expense side weve given the guidance for the year and i think you can see we tried to point out we had one opportunistic expense in the third quarter and we had an investment gain that specifically when i saw that gain an extraordinary gain i saw an opportunity to put that in our foundation about a million expense we pulled through there thats above what youve seen historically in that space and you wouldnt expect those are recurring type of quarterly expenses for us so we remain firmly in the space where we had said we were in the to expense growth range associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2022 we take very seriously what were going to look like in were all faced with some pressure on increased cost of doing business but for us what weve tried to do is identify cost saves going into the year and weve pulled a couple of those levers or made those decisions heading into the fourth quarter so whether that be some branch consolidations or decreasing the size of our mortgage business commensurate with the current volume so what i would say is that million we do invest in the foundation typically about million to million a year this is higher than that and it all came in one quarter so that is not likely recurring in the fourth quarter at any similar type of level so thats how i would think of expenses for the rest of this year within that guidance that we gave and frankly we would have been within our prior guidance had i not seen an opportunity to take care of our local markets in a way that we think is significant and meaningful so when i think about that and we havent provided guidance for but i will tell you were not going to say were going to spend the gain from every basis point of margin that were getting were going to remain disciplined in that space and i wouldnt have a change in the expense outlook based on that so really when we talked about the digital cost and what we do what i had explained before is its more a shift in spend so its a shift from dealing with physical spend to digital spend and i still feel the same way and frankly pretty enthusiastic about what ive seen in as much as launching a platform in september and following up in october beginning of november with another asset in that space and then following up in the first quarter with another one because were able to plug in a fintech into that so i know that wasnt your question but were able to do these things as we shift spend from physical to digital and the run rate it is factored in there terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc right appreciate that andy and maybe as a followup one might argue theres risk next year that deposit costs are higher wholesale costs are higher and i guess my question is would you be willing to scale back loan growth if funding just becomes too expensive and how do you think about that risk and manage that risk and i ask that question because when i look on slide youve got billion of commercial growth and another billion of auto finance which is unique relative to your peers and their need to fund asset growth next year andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah we have a lot of levers that we can consider and are considering i mean ill give you an example weve backed off on tpo in the last quarter i mean were down in originations but were only down in our core market residential lending originations so thats on purpose and so when we think about what we can slow and how we should look at our businesses well look at all the businesses that are in and well bias towards relationship business and so whether that is residential whether that is commercial with deposits whether thats the small business customer that brings deposits whether thats mass affluent or we go out to market which can bring deposits but the answer is if need be we can dampen that growth what well have to do is look at the cost and the benefit of what were doing so that were not running in place on any of those initiatives but certainly well look at all those levers terry mcevoy q analyst

good afternoon andrew j harmening a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hey daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just wanted to just a quick one here on reserves curious the contribution on the qualitative side of the acl trying to think through how a change in the moodys economic forecast could impact the overall reserves thanks patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp well in terms of the qualitative piece its relatively small part of our reserves about or so the reserves this quarter as we mentioned were really largely driven by the loan growth we had and really a continued stable credit metric and credit portfolio in terms of going forward were obviously watching the moodys forecast we feel like weve got a pretty good handle on allocation in terms of our overall acll so we feel good about where were going into next year were constantly watching that obviously given the macro headwinds that weve been talking about daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks and would you say its more the reserve calculation for you given that the footprint is more focused on the regional numbers and more specifically within the states or do you cast a wider net in terms of the forecast patrick e ahern a chief credit officer executive vice president associated banccorp no its probably a little more weighted to the regional for sure i mean as andy mentioned weve got some pretty good strong numbers coming out of wisconsin and minnesota et cetera we dont typically get the large upswings and conversely the large downswings you might see in some of the other markets here in the midwest so were definitely using that as a big piece of what were looking at
