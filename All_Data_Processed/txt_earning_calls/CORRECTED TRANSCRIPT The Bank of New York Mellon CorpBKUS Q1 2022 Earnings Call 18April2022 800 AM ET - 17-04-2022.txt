to see healthy underlying momentum across most of our businesses and reported revenue of billion which was roughly flat yearoveryear and it was up if you exclude the impact of government sanctions and the additional actions that were taken related to russia now were in an increasingly uncertain environment including the war in ukraine volatile markets and persistently higher inflation which will require more meaningful monetary policy adjustments it is in times like these that our strong lowerrisk balance sheet and the resiliency of our business model differentiates us in the face of the tragic events occurring in ukraine we ceased new banking business in russia and suspended investment management purchases of russian securities since the beginning of the war we stepped up our humanitarian efforts as well as the support for our employees and the members of our community who have been the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 impacted and we continue working for our multinational clients that depend on our custody and recordkeeping services to manage their exposures expenses of billion were up as we continue to invest in further growth and efficiency initiatives and we reported eps of and that included an impact related to russia we continue to generate a significant amount of capital and returned close to of earnings to our shareholders primarily through common dividends throughout the quarter we took actions in the investment securities portfolio to temper the immediate impact to capital from higher interest rates and we expect higher rates to be both a positive for fees and net interest revenue going forward emily will discuss the details for the quarter shortly but let me briefly touch on a few business highlights in asset servicing we managed to keep the strong sales momentum with which we entered the year wins and win rates improved off of what had been a healthy quarter a year ago won and mandated auca is up meaningfully both yearoveryear and quarteroverquarter producing a strong pipeline of auca to be installed in and beyond and our retention rate was an exceptional our etf business continues to stand out having increased the number of funds serviced by since the beginning of the year and we were recognized as best etf custodian at the etf express european awards last month we also

to be impacted by the previously disclosed lost business in the second half of last year and remember the first quarter of last year was exceptionally strong on the back of elevated transaction activity now while there are puts and takes here that can impact the amount of organic growth in any given quarter we remain extremely excited about pershings prospects our clients are doing well and as they capture new assets were growing with them and were well positioned to benefit from a number of secular growth trends such as the rapid growth in number of breakaway advisors and digitally oriented wealth firms of course consolidation in the sector can leave us on either side of any particular transaction but over time we find that our clients who are typically the largest and most complex players in the industry are more often than not on the acquiring side and in pershing x we continue to make solid progress since announcing the initiative back in october following on last quarters acquisition of optimal asset management this quarter we made several key hires which completed the filling out of our leadership team and we folded albridges wealth reporting and data aggregation tool under the pershing x umbrella this alignment strengthens pershing xs data offering allows it to draw on albridges engineers to accelerate development of the platform and provides clients with access to a broader suite of technology solutions the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 shifting to clearance and collateral management there

being mobilized to the emea region and growing providing our clients with optimization and funding benefits treasury services also delivered another solid quarter of growth driven by higher payment volumes and an improved product mix the business continued to build on its recent track record of industry first this quarter being the first bank to successfully connect to and send a message on the fednow realtime payment system and were excited to welcome jennifer barker to the company as the new ceo of the business starting in may jennifer brings almost two decades of global client experience

global financial system over the last four decades we have undergone an incredible transformation from the traditional commercial bank that we once were to the globally significant lowerrisk financial services company that we are today and im particularly proud of what weve accomplished over the last couple of years with a new leadership team in place we launched a compelling agenda for growth and innovation under which weve already seen a the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 meaningful pickup in organic growth weve also really evolved our culture today were much more performanceoriented and clientcentric were more nimble in our decisionmaking and were doing a lot better at connecting the dots across our differentiated businesses when our strategic ambitions and the strength of our franchise were tested by the global pandemic our people once again rose to the occasion and not only delivered on our commitments to our clients communities and shareholders but we also continued to make significant progress in our journey to position the company for the future in robin we have found an outstanding leader to build on this agenda and to lead bny mellon into its exciting next chapter having known robin as a client for almost a decade i was thrilled to recruit him to the company in and to work directly with him these last two years since then he has not only had a profound impact on the company through his leadership of pershing treasury services clearance and collateral management and our markets businesses but he has been a trusted strategic adviser to me and the rest of the executive management team robin and i are working closely together and with our executive committee to ensure a seamless transition in the next couple of months with that ill turn it over to emily emily h portney chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp thank you todd and ill add my congratulations to you on your retirement and i want to thank you for your leadership and mentoring over the years so good morning everyone as i walk you through the details of our results for the quarter all comparisons will be on a yearoveryear basis unless i specify otherwise starting on page total revenue was flat and included an approximately million reduction related to russia a notable item this quarter fee revenue was down or flat excluding the impact related to russia the benefit of higher market values as well as continued momentum across many of our businesses was offset by the impact of lost business in pershing and corporate trust in the prior year lower fx revenue off elevated levels in the first quarter of last year and the unfavorable impact of a stronger us dollar while not on the page firmwide auca of trillion increased by of which is growth from new and existing clients and is driven by the impact of higher market values net of currency headwinds aum of trillion increased by yearoveryear reflecting cumulative net inflows and higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar money market fee waivers net of distribution and servicing expense were million in the quarter an improvement of million compared to the prior quarter this reflects the benefit of higher average shortterm interest rates partially offset by higher money market fund balances once again our growth in money market fund balances meaningfully outpaced the industry together the impact of lower waivers and higher balances drove a sequential increase in pretax income of close to million on a yearoveryear basis fee waivers had a de minimis impact to our fee revenue investment and other revenue was million our net interest revenue increased by reflecting higher interest rates on interestearning assets change in mix and lower funding expense the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 expenses were up about or excluding notable items provision for credit losses was million the benefit from the continued improvement in the credit portfolio led by commercial real estate was more than offset by a ph million reserve build on interestbearing deposits with banks in russia and our effective tax rate was approximately as expected due to the annual vesting of stockbased awards in the first quarter which provided a seasonal benefit eps was and included an negative impact of the notable item related to russia pretax margin and rotce were and respectively on a reported basis and and excluding notable items onto capital and liquidity on page our consolidated tier leverage ratio which continues to be our binding constraint was down basis points sequentially the sharp rise in interest rates resulted in a billion impact to unrealized losses in our availableforsale securities portfolio and we distributed roughly of our earnings to our shareholders predominantly through dividends the impact of the reduction of capital on our tier leverage ratio was partially offset by the benefit of a smaller balance sheet quarteroverquarter our cet1 ratio was down approximately basis points compared to the end of the prior quarter primarily reflecting the negative marktomarket of the afs portfolio as well as an approximately 30basispoint impact from the adoption of saccr finally our lcr was consistent with the prior quarter turning to our net interest revenue and balance sheet trends on page which i will talk about in sequential terms net interest revenue was million up sequentially this increase reflects higher rates as well as continued growth in loan balances partially offset by lower cash and securities balances average deposit balances declined by while average interestearning assets were down sequentially within this loan balances were up nicely about sequentially moving on to expenses on page expense for the quarter were billion up about yearoveryear and up excluding notable items from last year this increase primarily reflects investments net of efficiency savings and it also reflects higher revenuerelated expenses which were partially offset by the favorable impact of the stronger us dollar a few additional details regarding noteworthy quarteroverquarter expense variances staff expense was up reflecting the annual vesting of longterm stock awards for retirementeligible employees distribution and servicing expense was up reflecting higher distribution costs associated with money market funds and net occupancy expense was down as we continue to optimize our real estate portfolio turning to page for a closer look at our business segments securities services reported total revenue of billion flat compared to the prior year excluding the impact of the reduction related to russia revenue was up fee revenue was down and up excluding the impact of russia and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates partially offset by lower deposit balances as i discuss the lines of business within our securities services and market and wealth services segments i will focus my comments on the investment services fees for each business which you can find in our financial supplement in asset servicing investment services fees grew by primarily reflecting higher market values and net new business partially offset by slightly lower transaction activity from existing clients as todd mentioned earlier our sales momentum continued to be strong compared to the first quarter of last year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 our issuer services business was significantly impacted by the reduction related to russia investment services fees were down specifically we accelerated amortization of deferred costs for depositary receipt services of russian companies which is a contra revenue item excluding this impact investment services fees were down approximately and this primarily reflects lower depositary receipt fees and the impact of lost business in the prior year in corporate trust next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion flat compared to the prior year fee revenue was also flat and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates and higher loan balances partially offset by lower deposit balances in pershing investment services fees were down this reflects the impact of lost business in the prior year as well as lower transaction activity versus a very active first quarter of last year partially offset by the impact of higher market values pershing continued to deliver solid underlying growth clearing accounts continued to grow at a annualized growth rate and we gathered net new assets of billion in the quarter in treasury services investment services fees were up as the business saw growth from both new and existing clients and continued to gain traction in highermargin products such as digital payments and in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up reflecting both higher tri party collateral management balances as well as higher clearance volumes now turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down fee revenue was also down investment and other revenue was a negative million and included losses on seed capital and net interest revenue was up reflecting higher interest rates as well as higher deposit and loan balances as mentioned earlier we ended the quarter with assets under management of trillion up yearoveryear this increase primarily reflects the benefit of cumulative net inflows into both cash and longterm products as well as higher market values partially offset by the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar as it relates to flows in the quarter we saw billion of net outflows from longterm products and billion of net outflows from cash having said that ldi continued to be a bright spot with billion of net inflows in investment management revenue was down higher market values were more than offset by lower seed capital results and lower equity income as well as the unfavorable impact of the stronger us dollar which is more impactful in investment management given that approximately of our revenue is earned in foreign currencies wealth management revenue grew by primarily reflecting higher net interest revenue and higher market values client assets of billion were up yearoveryear reflecting higher markets and cumulative net inflows and we continue to see healthy growth in both deposits and loans as weve expanded our banking offering and deepened our client relationships page shows the results of the other segment i will close with an update on our outlook for the full year of obviously given the backdrop of geopolitical uncertainty rapidly evolving global monetary policy and the continued overhang of the pandemic the macroeconomic environment is very uncertain the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 for our outlook we assume a scenario where interest rates follow the forward curve and market values stay relatively flat to where they were at the end of the first quarter with this in mind we project full year nir to be up roughly compared to embedded in this assumption we expect the correlation between rates and deposit runoff to be consistent with what we have seen in the past we now expect fee revenue to be up to this includes a tailwind of about from the reduction of fee waivers organic growth of plus and a to headwind from the impact of russia market values currency and other factors for expenses ex notable items we now expect an increase of approximately slightly lower than our previous guidance with regards to capital management weve taken a number of actions to reposition our portfolio to reduce the impact of higher rates and credit spreads for example we lowered duration in the afs portfolio reduced credit exposure and moved assets to htm these actions have reduced our aoci rate sensitivity by about going forward having said that we remain cautious on buybacks in the near term and based on the environment we described earlier we ultimately expect to return at least of earnings to shareholders this year we do continue to expect to return close to of earnings to our shareholders over time last but not least we continue to expect our effective tax rate for the year to be approximately with that operator can you please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will now take our first question from brennan hawken from ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thank you for taking my questions first todd congrats on your pending retirement and robin congrats on the new role i look forward to working closer with you before a question though for robin id love to drill down a little bit emily on what you talked about more tactically around the actions youve taken with the balance sheet to reduce the aoci sensitivity could you maybe expand on that a bit and touch on some of the specific actions in greater detail and what impact we could expect on the outlook for nir and how that might inform your updated expectation emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so brennan good morning im just taking a quick step back i do want to do a shoutout to our cio because i think that team really did do a great job in terms of both optimizing nir but also protecting against aoci volatility during the quarter as i mentioned in my prepared remarks and ill give a bit more color we shortened the duration of the afs portion of the portfolio its now a little over oneandahalf years down from more than two years at the end of last quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 weve transferred longerdated securities to htm youll notice that htm now as a proportion of the securities portfolio is about thats up from about at the end of last year weve also reduced convexity in credit risk in the portfolio and so all of these things i mean we did obviously there was a reduction in aoci of billion during the quarter but it would have been larger had we not taken these actions and as you rightfully point out these actions have also made us a lot less sensitive to rising rates going forward and as i also i think mentioned weve reduced just to put a finer point on it weve reduced dv01 in the afs portfolio in excess of just through the actions that we carried out this quarter so as you can tell weve been managing the portfolio very actively well continue to monitor it and be very nimble brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that emily robin maybe one for you stepping back and widening out here understand that youve just been named to the job but youre not new to bank of new york for sure so at this point can you provide any details or plans about your goals or targets or maybe at least like a roadmap for when we could expect to hear more from you about your goals and your plans robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp sure good morning brennan and i appreciate the comment and the question so youre right im not completely new to the firm which is certainly an advantage for me in coming in and taking on the role but i will say that im being very diligent as todd referred to earlier on in his comments about the transition and so were working very closely together and i dont want to be complacent about the fact that theres a great opportunity for a ceoelect to have the opportunity to come in and to really benefit from a transition having said all of that when i joined the firm i was really struck by the breadth of the franchise i mean of the worlds top investment managers are clients of ours as are of the worlds top banks and that breadth coupled with the depth of the franchise that real client trust that weve talked about before is a super powerful foundation and so job number one for me is to really build on that and thats been an investment that todd has been very focused on during his time as ceo now what i also would reflect on is some of the things that ive been focused on in the market and wealth services businesses and the first of those is innovation youve seen that weve launched pershing x weve been very focused on realtime payments in the treasury services space and that concept of really driving innovation across the enterprise is another important pillar of how i think about the firm and the opportunity thats ahead of us another thing that weve been doing in that segment which im very excited about across the company is really deepening the wallet connecting the dots across the firm helping clients that are existing clients of the firm to do more with us and that whole ethos of one bny mellon i think is a real important and deep vein for us to continue to mine and then the last point that id mention is operating leverage and focus on margins in that segment we had a margin in the first quarter and having run operational businesses in the past im very focused on operating leverage and that will continue to be a focus of mine along with these other pillars so thats how im thinking about the world but id just remind you that im still in the transition and enjoying working with todd and were really focused on making this a smooth and effective handover the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for that color robin thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brennan robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brennan thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp next question operator operator we will now take our next question from mike mayo from wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi what i was going to ask you robin i asked that at the shareholder meeting but maybe just a little bit more about your background i just say that when northern changed their ceo they said the old ceo is more about marketing and im more about numbers when state street changed their ceo they said well the new ceo was more about understanding asset management and their clients anything else since we dont know you as well as todd whos been there for in his fourth decade anything else about your background that you could share that could give investors confidence as you are about to enter the ceo role in several months robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp sure mike well im all about being a great allaround ceo but to answer the sort of question a bit more directly in terms of my background i feel like ive been prepared for this role over the course of my career i started off in the markets business and i ran the money markets business at my prior organization which was a great opportunity to really get into the markets capital markets interest rates and really the client franchise and of course a lot of those same clients are clients of ours and so that was a great formative start for me i ran operations at my prior firm i was a treasurer i was the chief risk officer i was the ceo of the international bank i operated internationally and so when i put all of that together i think it really gives me the opportunity having touched a lot of different aspects of our franchise and our activities to really bring all of that to bear in the role going forward and im very excited about that and as i joined the firm as i commented before ive been struck by a few things including the depth and breadth of the franchise but also the culture of the firm and i think that theres a lot of opportunity for us and im excited to have at it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 and so to summarize you kind of want to have like one bny mellon and improve the wallet share and hopefully im not sure if you guys can give this now i dont think so todd theres not too many firms that do it but whats your market share by large client where was it a few years ago and where do you hope it to be do you have any metrics around that or do you think we can get that in the future thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we havent disclosed that publicly but what i would say is we have grown with our clients and we have continued to increase market share with our largest clients over the past couple of years especially in our servicing business our asset servicing business and i think some of the stats that we even did disclose this morning that emily mentioned we retained actually i mentioned that we retained of all of the business that we rebid on which is an enormously high number and weve got some capabilities i mean the investments that weve made in service quality and some of that is in some of the technology that weve got around that keeping us much closer to our clients much better informed much more responsive the investments that weve made in our data management and data analytics where i think we are the leader not only in the servicing capabilities but also the fact that we can weve got the ability to bundle all of the backoffice services not just custody and accounting and administration but ta as well is a differentiator so i think we are seeing increased market share i havent disclosed it specifically against the major clients but i think the fact that we are with just about every one of the major clients reflects that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp thanks mike operator we will now take our next question from ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning everyone emily wanted to ask you a little bit on net interest income and some of the changes that youre referencing so i guess to start can you help us understand your point about historical reference of deposits versus qt or rates environment we saw deposits come down this quarter can you tell us what youre expecting to see out of the balance sheet going forward emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so when it comes to deposits and runoff what id first say is that were just using the forward curve so assume that its just as baked into the forward curve fed funds is about by the end of the year also were just assuming that betas largely retrace what weve seen in the last cycle it means that we will get to the end state faster but theyre going to largely retrace its correlated to rates and largely retrace what weve already seen the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 so with all that said we would expect deposits to probably run off maybe about over the course of this year and thats from where we are in the average of the first quarter weve already seen them come down a bit from the fourth quarter and just as a reminder our deposit base is largely institutional nibs part of the growth youve seen has been in nibs and so we expect that to kind of normalize too over time and the other thing i would mention is that as we see deposit run off we also could see a migration to money market funds and if that does indeed happen then obviously that could be a nice tailwind for us as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and then in terms of the shortening up of the duration can you tell us how i dont know if you can size the magnitude of how much that might have changed your current views of full year nii up versus what it might have been otherwise and how youre now redirecting incremental cash flows into the portfolio versus what you might have done otherwise if rates havent gone up this quickly emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we are weve obviously shortened duration across the portfolio weve swapped fixed to floating and considering just the uncertain environment were also continuing to be cautious and nimble ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then you mentioned the more cautious on buybacks in the near term and maybe returning this year how will you evaluate that obviously we can do math on what it means for this year but in terms of how much could the swings in aoci continue to impact even being able to do thanks emily emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure so as i mentioned it in my prepared remarks we still intend to return of our earnings to our shareholders over time and thats of course across dividends and buybacks weve been cautious and i think its been appropriate to be somewhat defensive in this environment with the uncertainty and of course the reduction in aoci but given the assumptions in our forecast we feel pretty confident that we would expect to return at least of our earnings to our shareholders over this year and the nice thing about scb and the scb framework is that we can be nimble we can be flexible and ultimately depending upon the runoff we see we might be able to do more operator we will now take our next question from steven chubak from wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to ask a followup on the nii guidance i appreciate the color emily on the deposit balance trajectory based on what we experienced last cycle i was hoping you could just speak to the deposit beta assumptions underpinning the guidance for the full year and also how much of a helper was premium amortization this quarter and how much of a benefit do you expect to realize over the course of the remainder of this year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so from a beta perspective as i said before we just expect betas to largely retrace what weve seen historically it does mean youll get to the end state faster in the first rate rise its generally and what weve experienced its very much as weve been expecting in line with expectations kind of betas of to by the time we kind of get towards yearend and we have many more rate hikes that will be probably closer to betas would be closer to 70pluspercent which is kind of where we ended in the last rate cycle in terms of what was your last sorry i missed the second part of the question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc sorry the premium amortization emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp oh premium am yeah it was helpful this quarter i dont have it right off hand but it was obviously definitely helpful this quarter but and we just expect it with rates rising as we go forward it will continue to be a bit helpful but frankly at a more modest level steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood and maybe just switching over to the fee side you spoke to fee revenue up to i believe emily and im sorry if i missed this you alluded to organic growth of 1plus being the underlying assumption i know you had been running at 2plus of late i wanted to get a sense is that organic growth guide more a reflection of conservatism challenging macro or just what youre actually seeing in the backlog of new mandates emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp its definitely not so much on at all on the mandate side we still fundamentally our businesses are in really good health the growth is really just considering the more challenging environment that were in and specifically when you look at market levels or client activity across some businesses have slowed down youre seeing or were expecting a bit more riskoff behavior and so the particular businesses which are probably most which are going to be most impacted we think are investment management corporate trust depositary receipts to a lot lesser extent asset servicing and so thats whats all baked into the 1pluspercent guide but the fundamentals are very good and we feel pretty good about that considering the challenging environment steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc i couldnt agree more and just one followup tickytack modeling question just on the asset servicing line i believe in the slides you flagged a gain on strategic equity investment i was hoping that you could size that for us emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp we dont disclose that in we dont disclose that sic discrete item the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah i would just add to that emily so if you look at our investment and other income it was about in line with the guidance that we had given on the asset servicing we do have some investments that weve said in some fintechs that we work very closely with strategically and theyve performed pretty well but as you might imagine in this down cycle in the first quarter we got hit pretty hard in our seed capital and some of our other things so netnet they basically offset each other steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions operator we will now take our next question from alex blostein from goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everybody thanks for taking the questions and congrats again to both todd and robin here so my first question is around the kind of connectivity between organic growth and operating leverage in the business so organic growth sounds like 1ishpercent this year fees were flattish yearoveryear expenses up right so i understand that theres obviously investments that you guys are making in the business but when you think about this on a to months out should we expect bk to get to a point where fee growth is more in line with expense growth i think this kind of dovetails maybe some of robins comments earlier around his focus on operating leverage emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so what i would say is look we are very focused on driving positive operating leverage and i just would remind you that overall for if you look at our total revenues we will be our plan is to deliver positive operating leverage this year and frankly thats with the impact of the russia notable items so i think thats pretty good in terms of fee when we think about just fee revenue versus expenses what i would say is that when you look at our the guide that we gave for the rest of the year it does our expense guide does include slightly more inflationary pressures as well as the investments of course that weve talked about extensively that we think are very compelling and some will pay off sooner and some will pay off a bit over the course of the next couple of years and as we talked about its way too early to kind of talk about like what its going to look like in say months months out but we have said that ultimately over time we would expect expense growth the rate of growth to moderate alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc all right well stay tuned for that my second question around maybe the issuer services business and really dr specifically i think in the earlier release when you guys announced the russia loss this quarter theres a comment there around just a more subdued level of revenue growth i think theres an ongoing effect from the russia exited business as well can you just level set us what the dr business does in revenues now per year the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 kind of net of these changes on a run rate basis and then ultimately how should we think about any other sort of geopolitical risk within that business i dont know to what extent china is part of that revenue stream thanks thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp emily you want me to take it or you want it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure go ahead thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp so i think theres a couple of questions there so russia was a it was a material component of the total dr revenue and the indication that we gave is there was a contra hit on kind of prepaid expenses there so that got reversed in the first quarter and that was the most of the million that we were talking about and on a go forward basis wed expect probably something like million probably million a quarter specifically from drs there are china is an important market to us too so we saw what we have seen alex is a little bit of fewer transactions fewer new issuance in china a little bit down and thats reflected in those numbers we dont break out the entire dr revenue line its a smaller a modest percentage of the total issuer services but it is impactful and it did as you can see it hit the bottom line in the first quarter alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it great thanks very much operator we will now take our next question from glenn schorr from evercore please go ahead glenn please ensure the mute function is switched off to allow your signal to reach our equipment thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay glenn you are on mute if you are still there so operator maybe we should go to another question or well ask glenn to operator perfect we will now take our next question from betsy graseck from morgan stanley please go ahead ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi this is ryan kenny on behalf of betsy good morning thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 good morning ryan ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc just a question on the pershing x initiative that was announced a few months ago wondering if you could dig in more on what specific areas youre looking to grow in and help us size the investment dollars timing and the roi of the investments here and any expected impact on margins thanks robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp sure ryan so look its an investment that were excited about as we step back from our pershing business where as you know were a real market leader in that business we touch about of ria accounts in the us we touch a little over of all rias with billion or more in aum one of the things that weve heard from our clients is that the world is getting increasingly complex for them as they think about how to really pull all of the capabilities that they need to run their businesses together and as weve really listened to our customers on that point we decided that there was a great opportunity for us to help solve some of those problems and so collecting the various different capabilities focusing on the data and the smooth movement of data across those various capabilities we saw that as an opportunity to really deliver something new and incremental to our customer base and weve tried to speed our way along that we hired as you know ainslie simmonds to run that for us shes recently completed the rounding out of her top leadership team we tried to speed our way to market with the acquisition of a direct indexing capability in the fourth quarter optimal asset management that was an example of a bolton capability that we think can just help us to accelerate but as weve disclosed before were not expecting this to drop much to the bottom line over the course of the next couple of years this is an investment in positioning pershing and the aggregate wealth management services platform for the future and so this is an investment in the medium to long term we think its important our customers very much want it and were excited for it ryan kenny q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks operator we will now take our next question from brian bedell from deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hello hi can you hear me thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey brian indiscernible the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great well first of all congrats again todd and robin and robin looking forward to working with you the first question is just on the shortterm second quarter outlook i know emily you gave the outlook for the full year maybe just to focus a little bit on the pace coming into the second quarter on the recoupment of fee waivers and any commentary on the sort of nearterm trajectory of nir for the second quarter emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah we really decided to do more of a full year guide versus second quarter but to size what youre thinking about and i think specifically on waivers if we do see the fed raise rates by basis points in may as i think were all kind of expecting obviously that will be a nice uptick in terms of recouping waivers and its to the tune of call it like million or so is what i is how id estimate it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then to focus a little bit longerterm on the organic revenue growth outlook the 1plus just i guess if we do get a better lets say if we get a riskon backdrop in the second half as opposed to the current sort of view of a challenging market backdrop how might that influence that organic revenue growth outlook is that enough to put you back in that area or do you really theres a lot of things youre working on to really build that organically and if you can just remind us the sensitivity of fee revenue to equity markets global equity markets improvement and then just lastly whether you would be considering any type of major acquisitions to accelerate revenue growth or really its just going to be a focus on organic emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so ill take a couple of parts to that and todd or robin might want to chime in about the inorganic opportunities but in terms of organic growth just remember when we define organic growth we are normalizing for market appreciation or depreciation but it is fair that riskon or riskoff behavior associated with that could also impact organic growth and so what i would say is its hard we dont really say like whats the sensitivity but yeah there certainly could be more upside if you see more riskon behavior and ultimately that means more trading more transaction volume et cetera so that is upside so its certainly not out of the realm of possibility that it could be higher in terms of what was your second brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the equity the fee revenue sensitivity to so like every increase in equity market emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 yeah emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp yeah weve disclosed this i think you can find it in the k so basically any like a move in equity markets is kind of happening gradually throughout the year is about an additional million in revenue brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah great and then just the inorganic emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp todd do you want me to take inorganic or you want to thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah why dont you go ahead and take it emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp the only thing id say thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp before you do emily just to add so brian just that was that was not an average at million that means if it goes up on average over the course of the year emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp over the course year yes thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp ph get us million brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah that makes sense yes thank you thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp okay you want to followup on inorganic emily the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp sure on inorganic what i would say and todd and i have been very consistent on this is that we are of course we always are evaluating inorganic opportunities but at the same time the bar is really really high and its not high just from a return perspective its also very high from an execution risk perspective so we have been doing several deals but theyve been mostly kind of digestible bolton things that are adding capabilities or markets or clients and we will continue to look out for those brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you very much operator we will now take our next question from michael brown from kbw pleased go ahead michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning robin vince a president chief executive officerelect the bank of new york mellon corp good morning mike emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp hello michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning i just wanted to ask about start with the average loans were up sequentially and year overyear so i just wanted to ask a little bit about where youre seeing the strongest demand and what are your expectations moving forward and the ability to meet that demand just given the expected trajectory of the deposit balances from here emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so actually weve been very proactively growing the loan portfolio so yes as you mentioned its up on average and yearonyear we will continue its our expectation to continue to grow that over the course of this year and where were seeing it is really on a couple of different areas so capital call facilities certainly trade finance likewise margin loans ccls and mortgages in wealth so thats pretty much across the board and thats we want to be there and leverage our balance sheet for our clients when it makes sense michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you emily and then just thinking about the capital ratios today and your comment on returning of net income any thoughts on the trajectory in terms of the quarterly pace just given that the tier leverage is the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 at or you ended the quarter at it seems like the buybacks may need to be a bit more backhalf weighted as the capital ratios kind of accrete higher from here is that a fair expectation emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp im not going to really comment on kind of how its going to be paced throughout the year i think you can kind of look at all of our ratios and make your own assumptions but and the thing i would just remind everyone again is that the scb framework is really allows us to be very nimble and very flexible michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you for taking my questions thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks mike operator we will now take our final question from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning everyone emily can you share with us and if its not available maybe you could answer it in a different way but in your quarterly and 10ks you and your peers always give us basis point parallel shift in the curve leads to an x percent increase or decrease in net interest revenue how does that how do you stand today at the end of the first quarter versus the end of the fourth quarter do you have that number and if you dont will it be lower by or compared to the fourth quarter emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp its we dont we will obviously be updating that when we release the q what i would say is were much more sensitive of course to shortterm rates than longterm rates that continues of course to be the case and youll see more of that when we actually release the q gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very good and then following up on the tier leverage ratio i think last quarter you mentioned that you guys are trying to manage to obviously youre slightly below that today where do you think how low can it go from where we are today or just your views on how youre managing that number emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp so in terms of tier leverage weve always said that given the extraordinary circumstances were in and all of the excess liquidity in the system that we would be it makes perfect sense to dip into our buffer to a degree which is what weve done we would expect of course as we start to see some probably deposit runoffs that that will take a lot of pressure off tier leverage the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 and what id also just flag is that by the end of the year its not its likely actually not out of the realm of possibility but frankly probably likely that our binding constraint will become cet1 versus tier leverage and frankly i think if youre toggling between tier and tier leverage and cet1 that actually is very good it means youre managing your balance sheet optimally gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just quickly on the htm i think you said you lifted your htm portfolio to of total securities is there a limit on how high you would take that to emily h portney a chief financial officer the bank of new york mellon corp there isnt a limit per se but we obviously do that very with our partners in risk and were always making sure that whatever we move there is highquality liquid assets that generally speaking you can repo it repo those assets et cetera so i wouldnt expect it to increase a lot more from here gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you appreciate it thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp hey gerard its todd ill follow up i just want to add to emily made i think all the right points around the capital ratios and the tier leverage but remember were probably too precise when we give you a number of something like if you remember thats a basis point buffer to what the requirement is and the reason its there is because we recognize that you could have a spike in the balance sheet and for us its not a risk spike its because deposits have increased and weve certainly seen that through the quantitative easing over the past couple of years or you can have a selloff and some impact in the oci thats exactly why the buffer is there so eating into the buffer in this type of situation is exactly what we would expect and its not really particularly constraining to us as we still have that basis points to emilys point and in our modeling if things run the way we would expect them off of the forward curve those deposits are going to come down or so and thats going to free up quite a bit of tier leverage basically and were estimating that were going to get pretty close to common equity tier which is a great place to be and it also means common equity is a little easier to manage because thats a riskbased asset ratio where we can manage its not just what comes on to the balance sheet so i want to make that clear probably in the future we should give you guidelines that are more ranges and we can kind of calculate where we are in the range gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good todd thank you and great run todd with bank of new york and good luck with your next endeavor thank you the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2022 thomas p gibbons a chief executive officer director
