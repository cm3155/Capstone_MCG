morning and thank you for joining us today its a pleasure to be with you and a pleasure to have the opportunity to represent such a great group of people as we report our performance this quarter each

areas of soundness profitability and growth but i am even more pleased with the leadership team and the culture that is being developed i want to thank our team for a tremendous job in great teams rise to the occasion in challenging times and this team has certainly risen to the occasion i will now turn the call over to john corbett john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you robert good morning everyone i hope you and your families are doing well and staying healthy we continue to make significant strides integrating centerstate and south state and its been gratifying to watch our teams gel together and watch their confidence grow since closing weve fully integrated the three lines of business of wealth correspondent and mortgage weve unveiled a new logo as well as launching a new website and a new mobile app and recently the board formally adopted our combined core values and guiding principles at the same time work continues to prepare for our upcoming systems conversion in may for the fourth quarter the company produced earnings per share of on a gaap basis adjusting for merger and other nonrecurring items earnings per share came in at with a return on tangible common equity sic return on average tangible common equity of for the entire year the company produced a record ppnr of million on a combined business basis with only basis points of chargeoffs asset quality remains strong with special mention and classified loans remaining flat from thirdquarter levels and payment deferrals continue to trend down we ended the quarter with just of loans on deferral and twothirds of those are making interest payments on the revenue side correspondent banking and mortgage continue to outperform in this lowrate environment and they help to offset industrywide margin compression and sluggish loan growth for our profits in correspondent banking were double our profits and mortgage was almost four times as profitable residential mortgage demand continues to be strong but we intentionally slowed the mortgage pipeline in the fourth quarter so that we could integrate the centerstate and south state mortgage computer systems together this resulted in a drop in mortgage income for the quarter but we anticipate that mortgage will be a strong source of fee income in now that the systems consolidation is complete we announced last quarter our agreement to acquire duncan williams a brokerdealer in memphis tennessee weve now received all regulatory approvals for the acquisition and we anticipate closing the transaction on february 1st were very excited to welcome duncan to our south state team and to expand our correspondent platform by adding a brokerdealer with record low mortgage rates we continue to see runoff in our residential portfolio as our clients appropriately refinance into our secondary market product however excluding the residential runoff of million and ppp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 forgiveness the commercial loan portfolio did grow modestly in the fourth quarter commercial loan production increased from thirdquarter levels and the pipeline now stands at billion which is close to the pipeline levels precovid deposit growth continues to be strong with core deposits increasing over annualized and we used some of our excess liquidity last quarter to pay off a 700million federal home loan bank advance which will reduce our interest cost over the next few years meanwhile our deposit cost continue to move down to basis points a reduction during the quarter now ill turn the call over to will matthews to provide additional detail william e matthews chief financial officer south state corporation thanks john our net interest margin was on a taxable equivalent basis down basis points from q3 loan yields of were down basis points from q3 accretion was million for the quarter down million and we recognized million in deferred ppp fees in q4 versus million in q3 so if you consider the net change in the two reduced accretion income and increased ppp deferred fee recognition they reduced interest income by approximately million from q3 nim excluding accretion was up four basis points from q3 nim excluding accretion and total ppp declined basis points to our loan repricing mix excluding ppp loans is fixed floating and adjustable loans declined by million or million excluding ppp loans in the quarter for a annualized rate and nonppp loan declines as john noted absent declines in the singlefamily residential portfolio exppp loans grew slightly on the quarter we put some of our excess cash to work in the securities portfolio which grew by million during the quarter our total cost of deposits improved another basis points to basis points for the quarter our cds are relatively short with coming due in this year we continue to carry significant liquidity billion on average for the fourth quarter weighing on our margin and we paid off the 700million fhlb advance in early december so we had a partial benefit in our liability costs this quarter turning to noninterest income our noninterest income of million was down million from q3 primarily due to a 23million decline in mortgage banking revenue mortgage production of billion was strong though down about from q3 levels and cash margins remained healthy up approximately basis points from q3 as john said the decline in mortgage revenue was largely caused by a significant drop in the pipeline and loans held for sale in advance of a midjanuary systems integration we continue to be a purchaseoriented mortgage lender with purchase volume representing approximately twothirds of our retail volume our correspondent banking division had another good quarter with revenue of million we expect the duncan williams acquisition to close february so we should see a partial quarters impact of this business in q1 we again welcome that team to the company other noninterest income was up million approximately million of which was a reduction of the cva on swaps steve has responsibility for these noninterest income business lines and hes available to answer questions on them during the qa session on expenses nie for the quarter was million including million in mergerrelated expenses and million in the fhlb payoff and related swap termination for an operating nie of million a couple of larger items of note in the quarter we aligned with the methodology for accruing ph fica on the ph synods to recognize them in the year earned rather than at payment resulting in a million accrual in q4 we also spent million with an outside vendor associated with an upgrade of our mobile banking app and related call center activity so outside of these two unusual items operating nie was south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 approximately flat with q3 we did spend a bit more on business development and employee recruiting and ph interconnection expenses were up about million from q3 our efficiency ratio was excluding the mergerrelated expenses and the swap termination penalty ill note that the 22million hit to mortgage revenue from the pipeline decline impacted our efficiency ratio by a little over basis points we continue to be on track with our cost saves and on mergerrelated expenses weve recognized approximately of the estimated million to date some of which occurred on the centerstate side preclosing turning to credit on slide deferrals are now down to a little over and we expect them to range between and over the next several months our criticized and classified assets were approximately flat down a few basis points from q3 levels as john said net chargeoffs remained very low and were again below million for the quarter ending npas were basis points of assets down basis point from q3 our provisions for credit losses was million for the quarter with another for the reserve for unfunded commitments liability in our cecl modeling this quarter we weighted two moodys economic scenarios the baseline and a downside s3 scenario in light of the worsening covid statistics and the potential that stimulus ppp forbearance programs et cetera may be masking losses incurred in the economy and in our portfolio that are not yet realized on slide our reserve coverage excluding ppp loans grew to including the reserve for unfunded commitments or just including the reserve for funded loans our loss absorption capacity ratio ended the quarter at similar to the q3 level for the effective tax rate as noted in the release we had a onetime benefit from an nol carryback under the cares act excluding that our effective tax rate for the quarter and year was approximately turning to capital our capital ratios continue to grow in q4 with our tce ratio growing basis points ending at our cet1 and total riskbased ratios grew by approximately basis points ending at and ending tangible book value per share was up from q3 and up to from the yearago quarter ill turn it back to you john john c corbett chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thank you will i would be remiss if i didnt close by thanking our south state team for a remarkable year in its been exactly one year ago that we announced the merger of equals between centerstate and south state over our first year together we faced the challenges of enduring a worldwide pandemic the economic shutdown the recession the ppp stampede over easter weekend and the feelings of isolation of working from home and the south state team overcame all these challenges while simultaneously navigating the most complex thing you can do in banking integrating a merger of equals theyve done an outstanding job and im very proud of them the groundwork weve laid in is going to pay big dividends in the years to come ill now turn the call back to the operator so we can open the line for questions south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions at this time we will pause momentarily to assemble the roster the first question today comes from jennifer demba of truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven hey good morning a hey jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc question as weve talked to other management teams over the last weekandahalf or so it seems like there are more and more opportunities to look at acquisition opportunities across the country just wondering what your interest is now once you get past your systems conversions in may thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning jennifer this is john really nothings changed from our message that weve delivered in the past were in the middle of a large transaction and things are going very very well but weve still got a large conversion ahead of us in may so thats where our focus is thats where our attention is but having said that this yield curve continues to stay low and flat that the whole industry is going to face these revenue headwinds and i think we want to remain opportunistic as we get past the conversion and keep our options open im continuing to have conversations with banks that weve talked to for many many years just havent gone to second base with any of those conversations until we get past the conversion jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc right and you talked about the mortgage pipeline declining intentionally in the fourth quarter what are you seeing here in the first quarter in terms of production trends and how strong do you think mortgage could be in stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yes jennifer its steve as it relates to mortgage just to kind of backup for a second on if we were a combined entity in the production of the mortgage bankers would have been about billion in on south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 a combined business basis we did about billion a really good pickup there in the fourth quarter our closings were about billion so that annualizes out somewhere in that billion to billion range were cognizant of the mda forecast that the mortgage will be down next year having said that we do have a much higher mix as will mentioned to purchase than most others and so this quarter it was close to two thirds and so as we got the systems converted and put in in the middle of january of this month it is very nice to see everybody on one system and to be able to manage it on one system so were seeing robust activity again mortgage is always hard to predict but we would expect because of our markets and others we should be in good shape for jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks a lot operator the next question comes from michael rose of raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning hope you all are well i guess the biggest question that i have you guys built the reserve a little bit this quarter you talked about deferrals ranging kind of around these levels credit metrics generally moved in the right direction weve seen a lot of other banks talk about declining reserves or reserve releases as we move forward obviously you guys are in really strong markets and then you kind of talked about some of the stimulus programs masking some losses so i guess im trying to reconcile this and with the credit market and everything why not have a more positive kind of outlook on credit just given what were seeing in the metrics thanks william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation sure michael good morning its will and maybe ill start i think our thought is that as the fed noted the economys path is dependent upon the virus and our view at the end of the year was that there was enough uncertainty around the virus whether its new strains the dissemination of vaccines herd immunity et cetera that a reserve release at this point based on what we know would have been too early and would not have been appropriate we also saw at this point december jobs report after the day of the moodys forecast and id just say looking forward as the picture becomes clearer and forecasting improvement and economic factors becomes less difficult that could result in reserve releases at that time if you look at our position relative to peers we would argue that our credit quality is very good results have been very good and clearly our reserve position is higher than many which we think puts us in a very good position regardless of the economy we face john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah and michael its john let me just add on to what will said about the reserve where we are with the reserve is due to national factors not our franchise i mean were following these models these national models but if you look at the credit performance as you mentioned this bank has had three quarters in a row with only basis point of chargeoff so we think the underwriting is sound deferrals are way down were feeling every south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 day were feeling better and better and more optimistic that weve turned the corner relative to credit but there is national phenomenon going on and we wanted that reflected in the loan loss reserve but as far as our own book every day we feel better michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay so it sounds like maybe just you guys are being conservative just given more the macro at this point as opposed to anything on your own portfolio okay thats helpful and then maybe just one more for me it looks like the pipelines were up a little bit i know everybody is having paydown issues we had some you talked about the mortgage issue would you expect kind of paydowns to slow as we kind of move through the year and i guess exppp and some of the runoff from the acquired book whats kind of the core loan growth outlook for the year i assume its going to be a little bit slower in the front half but probably accelerating in the backhalf like others have talked about any sort of initial stab at what growth could look like given the strong pipeline thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah i think thats right and as i tried to articulate in the prepared remarks we did see loan growth in our commercial loan portfolio a little bit this quarter its really the residential payoffs that are creating such a headwind but that residential payoff is were controlling that product into the secondary market and making these fees so i do feel like were turning the quarter on credit get more optimistic each day if i had to guess i think wed head into were probably into low to midsingle digit growth and i do think it will pick up more on the backend of the year than the front but encouraged pipelinewise before the pandemic the pipeline was about billion at the low last summer it got down to billion and i looked at it this morning were back up to billion so its really really close i do want to be cautious however from an underwriting standpoint the world is awash with liquidity right now and everybodys trying to put this liquidity to work and as i talk to dan and others about credit we are seeing some competitive forces where there is some structure creep in deals where people are becoming more aggressive as far as being willing to drop guarantees and lower downpayments so we think theres opportunities but were going to pass on some of them as well if the structures get too loose michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thank you i appreciate all the color operator the next question comes from stephen scouten of piper sandler please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven good morning steve south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co i wanted just one clarifying question on the loan losses revenue answer was good there about the models versus your markets and your book but will when you talked about kind of looking at two different scenarios the base case and the s3 i think you called it was that a changed quarteroverquarter or is that kind of the same mix you had in the scenario waiting as the quarter before william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation you know stephen it was a change we were baselineonly before and so we did ph weight in a more pessimistic scenario for part of the weighting this quarter so that was the change stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect thank you and then i guess with the balance sheet you know i think the mention was billion give or take of excess liquidity and you noted million in securities purchases this quarter but as it looks like liquidity it seems is going to hang around for a little bit longer what could we continue to see in the securities book and what are you seeing on new investment yields there stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation so stephen its steve youre right we still continue to have a fair amount of excess liquidity when we did see the after the election rates rose we took the opportunity to buy a little bit higher yield so i thought that indiscernible more of an opportunity as we think about that portfolio historically the way weve thought about it is the percentage of assets and so today were not quite to of assets but we have tried to manage that to of assets obviously were all not sure how the excess liquidity is going to play out over the next few quarters but and we also want to make sure that were not locking into investments that really dont give you a whole lot of yield at the lowest rates but i guess from my perspective i think the way to think about this model is somewhere between and of assets until we change anything in the future i hope thats helpful but you know as far as going on yields were pretty vanilla there we like to put the investments out for liquidity so our going on yields are somewhere between to on these purchases stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect very helpful and then just last thing for me thinking about the million share repurchase obviously your stock has done very well i think in this kind of recovery environment weve seen in the group but youre also building capital extremely rapidly so how aggressive could you remain with the share repurchases from here john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah stephen this is john i mean i think what youve always heard from us is that we feel like our role is to be active capital allocators this reauthorization the board gave us yesterday gives us million shares which is about of the company and as you noted the capital formation rate is pretty strong midteens rotce and south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 with all the liquidity its unlikely that were going to grow our balance sheet so we see that capital rate continue to build so all i would tell you is the buyback is in place to maintain maximum optionality and its something we look at quarterbyquarter we dont budget it in its not a budgeted item for us we look at just facts and circumstances of how we can deploy capital every quarter but we have been active in the past and now we have that flexibility going forward stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it thanks a lot for the color and appreciate the time john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven you bet operator the next question is from catherine mealor of kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven morning a morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to just followup on just your bigpicture thoughts on the outlook for the core net interest margin pulling out ppp and pulling out the impact of accretive yields john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yes hey catherine its john im going to let steve answer that but ill make a couple of comments about nim before he does its such an important driver of the performance of the bank however we benefited this past year from having some diversified revenue beyond nim and for even with the yield curve doing what it was the company we beat the consensus forecast for the calendar year i think a year ago before we announced the merger it was million we actually as a combined business company did million so it was about a beat on pretax preprovision profits south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 and the yield curve as we think about it it can go in two directions here we could wind up in a prolonged recession and the yield curve could remain low and flat and if it does our nim is going to continue to compress i mean weve hit the floor on deposit costs we got it down to basis points so we cant really push that lever anymore but in that scenario that prolonged recession were going to continue to see fee income businesses outperform if you go back to the fee income businesses on a combined basis did million this past year it jumped to million so big increase to offset the nim and what youre going to get with south state in a for a long recession is youre probably going to get better asset quality performance if you look at the last three quarters basis point of charge offs only deferral and weve got a very strong reserve over on the flip side if we flip to a recovery mode where the yield curve steepens and its sort of what we started to see here in the last month or two with the stimulus probably what youre going to see is our fee businesses are going to pull back but our margin we think is going to open quite a bit faster than most in the industry because our core deposits again is so strong and that were going to get more than our fair share of loan growth because of the markets were in but in this recessionary environment with that diversified fee income its given us a midteens rotce boy if the rates go up if the yield curve steepens we look for that return on equity to go back in the upperteens and maybe closer to so thats a big picture of how the business is performing as a whole and the puts and the takes but specifically steve if we round up where the yield curve stayed where it is today how does that look stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yes john and to answer your question a little bit more direct catherine if the rate forecast is similar to where we are now for the year and we assume the low to midsingle digit loan growth in and the last assumption is we assume the fourthquarter net interest income dollars is kind of the baseline we would expect low to mid single digit percentage decline in net interest income in naturally it would be better if the yield curve gets steeper and the rates rise and just to further that last point back to our core deposits we checking makes up of our total deposits we have about checking accounts and a 17basispoint cost of deposits so as we think about the nim thats sort of how we think about it for catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats helpful and in that scenario again back onto your point john how do we think about john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven catherine i think i lost you can you hear me operator pardon me it looks like catherines line disconnected john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven okay operator the next question is from kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson please go ahead south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven hey kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co most of my modeling questions have been asked and answered just maybe taking a step back more of a biggerpicture issue now weve been you know as you all mentioned a year from the moe getting announced and now youve had you know a little little over half a year of being together and youre coming up to the main conversion in may im just curious if you take a step back and i know weve been dealing with a different environment than you guys envisioned when this was announced but would have been what had been some of the main positive takeaways or surprises and maybe something thats a little more challenging than you might have envisioned when you announced this deal sitting in hindsight today john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah kevin so you know between our two companies you now the centerstate probably has ph in all done acquisitions last decade or so south state a large number of acquisitions theres a lot of experience here but an moe is different and i would tell you looking back on it what makes it different is the is the volume of decisions that have to be made and the volume of change that occurs if you do it right if you get in a room and you look at the best practices of both companies and you take the time to choose the best path forward youre going to wind up with a better company betterrun company than either company would have been standalone but it takes a lot of effort to have those discussions you know objectively make those decisions and thats what were doing i mean the south state franchise had some processes in place with technology that centerstate bankers are just thrilled to take advantage of one of them is the new mobile app that we put in place at legacy south state last month we added checking account users to that platform the centerstate clients will go on it in may south states got a great treasury platform centerstate has great capital markets through the correspondent banks so the challenge in the work is taking the time to make the right decisions and its just a high volume but the end product is every bit as good as we hoped it would be kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co thats great thank you and just a quick followup on the question before on ma and your potential interest there on one hand you guys have a very strong geographic franchise so how do you weigh the opportunities for more scale versus what where exactly you want to be from a franchise perspective because im assuming theres probably some states or some markets you dont have interest in but when you look at the southeast in general i would assume your primary interest would be in markets youre are already in but how whats high on your list of interests in terms of markets youre not currently in thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 yes kevin back to your comment we dont believe in ma for the sake of scale only i mean thats not the primary driver its got to make financial sense to do a deal but if we had our indiscernible strategically we would love to continue to dial down and build density in these highgrowth urban markets in the southeast we love the markets were in in charlotte greenville atlanta charleston you get down to florida in the orlando tampa jacksonville markets we would love to continue to build density in those markets and if interest rates stay low and there continues to be expense pressures i think weve got a track record of being able to consolidate banks that have branch overlap if you look at the last decade weve acquired over branches and consolidated over branches and thats driven our average branch size from million to now its well over million i think its million now whether or not all those stars will line up that would be what our preference would be kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co thats great thanks very much john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven you bet operator the next question is from brody preston of stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven hey brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc ive got a handful of questions ill just ill just ask some of them now and then maybe hop back in the queue to see if i got a chance to hop back on but i just wanted to clarify something on the mortgage so i appreciate the color around the reduction in the closings it looks about off the quarterly run rate from earlier in the year on a combined business basis but im assuming a slowdown more dramatically impacted the locked pipeline given the swing in the fair value marks so i just wanted to get a sense for what the decrease was in the locked pipeline in relative to and then how thats shaping up in now that youve got the conversion behind you stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah brody this is steve youre exactly right its related to the locked pipeline i believe the numbers i dont have them quite in front of me but here it is million at the end of the third quarter versus million at the end of the fourth quarter if you look at our cash gain on margin if you just looked at it from that perspective in the fourth quarter we were in the range versus the third quarter as well over and thats back to the intentional nature of what we were trying to do in order to convert the systems and raise margins on our way into this system conversion south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 and so obviously thats going to bring less volume less pipeline but as we get the systems converted here in january now we kind of get back to normal and more normal margins and more normal locks so hopefully thats helpful as you think about it brody preston q analyst stephens inc yes now thats very helpful i appreciate that and then just on the incentive expense that you called out i wanted to ask if that was more of a trueup for the year that maybe wont reoccur moving forward or is that something that will stay in the run rate john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah brody it really reflects two different methodologies one company expensing it at the time of payment and one company accruing it in the year of being earned and so we moved to the methodology where we are accruing it in a year earned so its a catchup in the fourth quarter but of course well be paying ph fica expense on all incentives going forward but onehalf the company i guess would have expensed it in the first quarter when it paid out for last years incentives brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven makes sense brody preston q analyst stephens inc yeah it does and then core ci growth on the quarter was actually pretty strong about annualized and so i wanted to ask was there anything specific that drove that stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah we continue to see great activity in our middle market bank that weve been building weve had great luck from a recruiting standpoint we i think we issued a press release sometime in the fourth quarter where weve hired nine commercial bankers two middlemarket bankers that were in jacksonville some of them are up in charlotte so just the activity the energy in our ci middlemarket bank is very very strong so i would look for that to continue brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay great and then last one for me right now and ill pop back into the queue john thanks for the color on how the pipeline stacking up its good to see it sort of back up almost to yearago levels i wanted to ask whats the whats the sort of historic pull through rate on the pipeline south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven thats a good question and i dont have that stat right in front of me brody i have to get back to you on that brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation and i would also add just as well that with the pullthrough rate too the other thing thats one has to factor in of course is the payoff rate as well and that fluctuates of course in different environments brody as you know brody preston q analyst stephens inc yeah understood all right thank you ill hop back in the queue operator the next question comes from chris marinac of janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning i know will talked a little bit about the cost of sort of new hires or just the expenses related to that i was just curious john or whomever whats your outlook for that in general how competitive is it and do you have a sort of i guess an internal goal of new producers that youd like to recruit this next year john c corbett a chief executive officer director centerstate bank na winter haven yeah i talked to greg lapointe whos our chief banking officer the other night and the opportunity set for hiring commercial bankers middlemarket bankers from some of the largest banks in the country is better than weve ever seen and these are not the bc bankers these are folks that have spent their entire careers at some of these banks and theyre 30yearveteran bankers so you know were going to continue to pursue those and again its kind of like the buybacks chris its not something you really budget you just take advantage of it when the opportunity is there greg said the other night i think hes talking to another nine people in atlanta the carolinas in florida so you know theres occasionally theres retirements and turnover those kinds of things but well just update you every quarter and were not putting a limit on how many great bankers were going to ph have at the company christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc i appreciate that that all makes sense just a quick one for steve on the correspondent banking business can you remind us on seasonality either in the third and fourth quarter that with your most recent success or just what would happen in the next couple of quarters from a seasonal standpoint south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation sure let me try to take a step back and maybe because we have indiscernible position and so on let me try to help bring that up for you and maybe help frame up the entire fee income businesses as it relates to correspondent this year was just a record year ph brad james who indiscernible has done a phenomenal job our fee income was approximately million on a combined business basis this year last year its around million million so its up million most of that increase was driven our interest rate swap product and of course fixed income got a little bit better you know as we think about how that rolls into our forecasts for fee income it really our guidance really hasnt changed from the last quarter and we talked about mortgage and the potential declines there and really we dont see anything changing for based on what happened in the fourth quarter but we would expect just total fee income to decrease from the whole level which was around million but approximate the fourth quarter levels which is about below the level so as we think about the entire bucket of fee income weve got some puts and takes in there we went from million to million mortgage is going to be a little bit more challenging the interest rate swap environment will not be probably as robust but it will be offset by our acquisition of duncan williams and the fixed income there so hopefully i know theres a lot of moving parts in there but hopefully that helps frame up how were thinking about it christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay and again applies to the whole fee income not just to correspondent is that right stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation thats correct christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah super steve thank you very much for the information here stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yes operator the next question comes from catherine mealor with kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks im back im sorry my call dropped challenges of working from home and actually chris marinac just got my second question so steve you answered that perfectly may i ask just one other on just ppp and the next round what so far are you seeing as activity and what are your expectations for what type of ppp levels you may see this year thanks south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah good question catherine remember last year our numbers we did almost loans for billion we turned the portal on a little over a week ago for round and right now weve got applications or million so right now where we stand after about or days of having the portal open were at about of what we actually did last year but talking to richard murray whos driving the program for us the applications were really strong the first couple of days and they started slowing down somewhat so if you had to ask him about the crystal ball where we wind up were guessing that we might wind up in the to of what we did last year round which would mean maybe it winds up in the billion to billion range stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation and catherine this is steve let me just add to that on the round forgiveness i know that thats been a question and the timing and model there in the fourth quarter we had about million forgiven in the fourth quarter and as john mentioned were really focused on helping our clients with ppp round and putting forgiveness a little bit on the back burner just because we need to get the new funds into our clients hands and so we would expect there to be forgiveness thats probably similar in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter but it should be heavier in the second and third quarter so hopefully that helps you from a modeling as we think about the forgiveness and then the last thing i know chris asked me and i did not actually answer was just around the seasonality of our fee income and hes right there is some seasonality typically in the first quarter and yeah its a little lighter generally around mortgage and correspondents historically been that way and always worked out that way but typically its a little bit a little strong a little bit weaker and then it strengthens during the year hopefully that helps catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks so much operator the next question is a follow up from brody preston with stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc yes thanks thanks guys i just wanted to ask a couple of followup questions on the nim core loan yields ex ppp and accretion continue to hold up fairly well following the combination and so i wanted to ask if you could give us a sense for what the rollon rolloff looks like right now what your new origination yields versus whats are rolling off the back book stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation brody its steve if you look at our loan yield and look at it exaccretion and exppp loans for the fourth quarter our loan yield was our new production yields in the fourth quarter came on around and so thats the two numbers i think in the third quarter our new production yields were around so and the yield south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 curves moved back up so well probably as you think about i would think that new loan yields will probably be in the range for the year depending on where the yield curve is of course brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay understood i guess i was looking back at sort of legacy centerstate and south state exclusive and looking back a couple of years ago at what are origination yields look like and they were somewhere in that range sort of consistently and so i wanted thats sort of what i was getting at is there sort of a higher yielding backbook that might be rolling off in the near term or was there repricing that occurred since that time just given the fixed versus floating nature of the book that is mitigating that stephen dean young a chief strategy officer south state corporation yeah no huge difference i mean you know typically were putting on a fiveyear duration indiscernible so you know what were rolling off today is what we rolled off or put on in or repricing today so the environment was totally different than it was you know in and when the rates were higher so no significant difference to the overall average i would say brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay i appreciate that and then on accretion i didnt see it in the release you had a table in last quarters release so i wanted to ask what the ending balance of the unrecognized accretion on acquired loans was and also how much paa is left over from the legacy south state portfolio from the acquisitions that they had done william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah brody its will on slide on that loss absorption capacity slide weve got about million at in the remaining unrecognized discount i cant cite for you the amount of that that is on older acquisitions it would be a an insignificant amount but i dont know the numbers precisely brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and so as i think about accretion moving forward you know theres a pretty good step down this quarter from the million to the million and so i just wanted to get a sense for what you all thought the run rate on accruable yield would look like in william e matthews a chief financial officer south state corporation yeah and if youll recall you listen to a million participated in a lot of calls every quarter but if you recall our last quarter we had some discussion around the difficulty in predicting accretion and i would refer everyone back to those comments but having said that i would also say q4 feels a lot more representative than q3 where in q3 we had million roughly and q4 it was million that feels given the remaining balance that feels like a more normalized level but it is not a scientifically accurately prediction but that feels more like a normalized level south state corp ssb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2021 brody preston q analyst stephens inc understood thank you all for taking my questions this morning i appreciate it william e matthews a chief financial officer south state
