cautiously optimistic about the overall outlook we are maintaining economic qualitative factors consistent with previous quarters until theres more clarity about the pandemic and the economy therefore we did not release any reserve this quarter our nonperforming loans represented basis points of total loans at the end of the first quarter a slight increase of basis points from the linked quarter but a decrease of basis points from a year ago nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets decreased to basis points compared to basis points a year ago the delinquency ratio decreased to

chief financial officer for more details on our performance and financials heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon everyone ill begin today with earnings per share which was reported at this quarter the only significant item this quarter was acquisition and integration costs of million or per share aftertax which related to the systems conversion integration of aimbank in february so again this quarter our core results were strong before i go into my detailed comments i would like to remind everybody that our updated first quarter investor presentation is available in the ir section of our website so ill start my detailed comments today with the provision for credit losses which totaled to benefit this quarter and reflects the following components first total loan balances excluding ppp declined to ph million second we continue to have some loan downgrades that result in a small increase in reserves third the consensus economic forecasts continue to show some moderate improvement however the economic outlook factors and components used to develop the allowance were left unchanged reflecting our assessment that the there is still a significant level of economic uncertainty and last net chargeoffs were logged in this quarter just under million or basis points of average total loans so at quarter end the allowance for credit losses for loans was million or of total loans and the allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was million or basis points of total loans together these two allowances result in a total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses of million or of total loans when the ppp loan balances are excluded the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses stands at of loans compared to last quarter in addition at quarter end we had unamortized purchase loan valuations on the balance sheet totaling million or basis points of total loans excluding ppp moving to the rest of the balance sheet investments grew million this quarter and comprised of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just under six years and generate million to million of average monthly cash flow borrowings decreased million to end the quarter at million or of assets the tangible common equity ratio declined basis points to at quarter end ratio declines of basis points from the decrease in market value of investments and basis points due to the larger balance sheet were partially offset by a basis point increase from retained earnings heartlands regulatory capital ratios also remained strong with the common equity ratio or common equity tier ratio at just under and the total risk based ratio at just over so the balance sheet continues to be very strong and wellpositioned moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter or million higher than the prior quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was down basis points compared to last quarter as a 10basispoint decline in investment yields and 4basispoint decrease in loan yields was partially offset by a 4basispoint drop in interest costs the decrease in the margin was also impacted by million reduction in fees recognized for ppp loan forgiveness and amortization which reduced the net interest margin by basis points compared to last quarter we exited the quarter with just under million of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which is up basis points from the prior quarter noninterest income totaled million for the quarter down million from last quarter as all components of mortgage banking income combined were flat and security gains decreased million compared to last quarter in addition service charges were million higher this quarter primarily reflecting a full quarter run rate from our new acquisitions heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 shifting to noninterest expense expenses remain wellmanaged totaling million for the quarter up million excluding noncore acquisition integration restructuring and tax credit costs as well as asset gains and losses our core expenses increased million to million compared to million last quarter this increase reflects a full quarter run rate costs from our new acquisitions so as we look ahead to the rest of we believe htlf will continue to deliver strong results highlighted by first our improving loan pipelines leading to unexpected loan growth rate exppp in to range next quarter with improving growth rates in the back half of as the economy continues to strengthen remaining round one ppp forgiveness will happen largely over the next two quarters and the new round of ppp which ended the quarter at ph million net of fees deferred is expected to grow but is likely to stay below million our nontime deposit growth is expected to be modest next quarter and then flatten and could even show some runoff in the back half of the year net interest margin will continue to see some modest pressure however net interest income is expected to grow to per quarter going forward provision for credit losses are expected to remain low and could be negative over the next quarter or two and then return to more normal levels as long growth picks up and the economy has stabilized noninterest income excluding investment gains or losses in total is expected to increase by next quarter to above million then flatten in q3 and decline somewhat back to q1 levels in the fourth quarter core expenses are expected to increase just slightly into the million to million range in q2 and then settle into the million range thereafter we believe a tax rates are reasonable full year run rate assuming no tax law changes and lastly we expect the tce ratio to climb back above by the yearend as we get about basis points increase from retained earnings per quarter however higher longterm rates could continue to weigh on the ratio and with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc elaine if you could open up the line for questions from analysts heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of jeff rulis from da davidson jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thank you good afternoon bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc good afternoon jeff bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co so a lot to unpack there i guess bryan on the expense side so thats maybe ill just take a step back the branch rationalization expectation for the what you completed recently but is there more on the horizon indiscernible continue in this year bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think there might be one or two thats built into the numbers i talked about but not a lot more were continuing to look at those so i havent put those in yet bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so jeff this is bruce so the last couple of quarters weve indicated that about of our branches have been under sort of review and the vast majority of those changes occurred last quarter so i would really just echo what bryan said theres probably still a handful that were looking at but i would say its were going to get some benefit but its not going to be a material benefit going forward from any cost reductions associated with branch closures jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so if and with the conversion behind us and we have what i would assume a lot of the merger costs kind of go away that gets ph you like to that so i mean i suppose cost savings from there its more of a if we see efficiency improvement its more a revenue equation rather than net expense decline bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 yeah yeah i think it would hold yeah i think itd hold expenses relatively flat like i say they might go up just a little bit this quarter only because weve got salary increases that go up there are some things that cleaned up in the first quarter and then youve got a little bit of the aim efficiencies that will come in as we kind of get a full quarter after our after the conversion so all those things kind of net to close to maybe a slight uptick and then it should settle down and be really pretty flat going forward jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and then last one is just to confirm the core margin do you ever figure relative to maybe the million that excludes ppp and the accounting adjustments bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think its around million give or take basis point jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay how does that match with the fourth quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i think thats down about basis points we were down jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc indiscernible get there is we were down basis points negative basis points from ppp but a positive basis points so im sorry the other way around it positive basis points and negative basis points it gets you to right around that 6basispoint range jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co ph core compression got it okay ill step back thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks jeff operator and your next question comes from terry mcevoy from stephens terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 hi good afternoon everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hey terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc bryan maybe just a quick question for you and i appreciate all the forwardlooking commentary the net interest income guide for the second quarter how does that incorporate ppp either as the first quarter or out into the second quarter i just want to make sure i understand your outlook correctly there bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say id put just a little bit of additional since it was down this quarter and really forgiveness really slowed down at the end of the first quarter i think that number could be flat to up just a little bit kind of left the amortization of pa purchase accounting the same so really what its about is the loan growth that bruce talked about and we probably wont grow the balance sheet to do that we probably will just use cash flow off the investment securities and use that to kind of increase the mix so that will help the nim and also we get an extra day next quarter so all that wed put it in i get to somewhere between and increase terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thanks bryan bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry indiscernible bryan said it was around ppp were going to see a pickup in the second quarter because we didnt see as much as we were working on the originations of ppp queue in the first quarter terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks for that bruce and then just an ma question in the prepared remarks it sounds like youd love to acquire a similar amount of assets in as you did in and after your experience with aim and the integration of a larger deal would your preference be and i know you need to take what the market gives you would your preference be one larger transaction or are you really open to anything in order to build the scale that you discussed bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah terry ive addressed this in the past and you know all things being equal which was never the case obviously but assuming that all things are equal we would always take a larger transaction versus a smaller transaction and we would all always favor an end market acquisition versus the new market and the current deals that we have in the pipe that are active would be both in our western markets and in our midwest market so being in states we see an awful lot of deals and so now the balancing act is just to make sure youve got the most accretive acquisitions that give us the best returns and indiscernible heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thats helpful thanks so much thanks everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you terry operator and the next question is from andrew liesch from piper sandler andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey good afternoon everyone bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co just the securities book has increased the last several quarters and it sounds like you want to use cash flows off and as well as the ongoing builds in fed funds and other cash to fund loan growth but how should we look at the size of the securities book are you going to add more to it or do you think its reached a peak and should decline from here bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc it really depends on the inflows as much as anything andrew but i would say wed like to keep that about the size maybe even down a little bit if deposits slow down and we can generate the loans and we can sort of shift that asset from investment to loans that would be our that would probably the perfect scenario i think its the right thing to do to wait for rates to go up where we would start wanting to grow that portfolio at all its of assets so its pretty big for us i think normal times wed love that to be more like between and so weve got a ways to go to kind of hold that down if we can andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it and then im just curious like what securities were you indiscernible the yields that were being added in the first quarter was bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think weve probably been doing agency paper trying to stay on the lower side in terms of duration so youre were talking low to mid probably not some to get too excited about but its better than zero were just a couple of basis points indiscernible cash so heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co certainly and still pretty sharp cool you guys have covered all my other questions thanks so much bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks andrew operator and the last question comes from damon delmonte from kbw damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybody is doing well today so most of my questions have been asked and answered but just wanted to follow up on the margin so bryan i think with the basis points or so of accretable yield thats somewhere like around million so should we be modeling in like million per quarter going forward for at least the next two or three quarters bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i would think plus or minus that its really hard to project it really depends on how loans and i dont i always get surprised by that number which way it goes a few basis points so i think kind of consistent would be what i would do damon damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just through actually the core margin is expected to still kind of trend a little bit lower right for the next couple of quarters is that what you said before bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah like i say it really depends on how well we can do on the loan growth if we can get the loan to replace some of the investments i think we can hold it flatter if that doesnt happen or if we get a lot more liquidity that we cant put in the loans it could come down a bit it went down basis points i wouldnt think it would go down any more than that but i would think it should try to be pretty flat damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then im sorry you done oh and then bruce some of the commentary on the expected loan growth can you just give a little bit more color on like whats giving you that confidence are you looking at your loan pipelines and things are progressing pretty steadily and you expect these deals to be closing and hitting the books like imminently is that kind of how youre feeling comfortable with some of that commercial and ag expectations bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2021 yeah damon thats exactly it when you look at closing dates and you look at i mean today were basically a third of the way through the quarter and what is already closed gives me a lot of confidence in the numbers ph of commercial and ag growth as well as we should have some consumer growth as well damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay good stuff thanks a lot guys appreciate it operator and thank you as there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mr lee for closing comments bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you
