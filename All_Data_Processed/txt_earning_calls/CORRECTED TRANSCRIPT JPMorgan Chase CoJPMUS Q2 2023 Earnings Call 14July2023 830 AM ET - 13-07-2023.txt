management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases second quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go to the live presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the deck starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of these results included the first republic bargain purchase gain of billion a credit reserve build for the first republic lending portfolio of billion as well as million of net investment securities losses in corporate touching on a few highlights ccb client investment assets were up yearonyear we had record longterm inflows in awm and we ranked number one in ib fee wallet share before giving you more detail on the financials let me give you a brief update on the status of the first republic integration on page the settlement process with the fdic is on schedule with a number of key milestones being recently completed systems integration is also proceeding apace and we are targeting being substantially complete by mid2024 first republic employees have formally joined us as of july and were pleased to have had very high acceptance rates on our offers and although its still early days as we get the sales force back in the market we are happy to see that client retention is strong with about billion of net deposit inflows since the acquisition now turning back to this quarters results on page youll see that in various parts of the presentation we have specifically called out the impact of first republic where relevant to make things easier im going to start by discussing the overall impact of first republic on this quarters results at a firmwide level then for the rest of the presentation i will generally exclude the impact of first republic in order to improve comparability to prior periods with that in mind in this quarter first republic contributed billion of revenue million of expense and billion of net income as noted on the first page this includes billion of bargain purchase gain which is reflected in nir in the corporate segment as well as billion of allowance build and remember that the deal happened on may so the first republic numbers only represent two months of results youll see in the line of business results that we are showing first republic revenue and allowance in ccb cb and aum and for the purposes of this quarters results all of the deposits are in ccb and substantially all of the expenses are in corporate as the integration continues some of those items will get allocated across the segments now turning back to firmwide results excluding first republic revenue of billion was up billion or yearonyear nii ex markets was up billion or driven by higher rates nir ex markets was down million largely driven by the net investment securities losses i mentioned earlier partially offset by a number of less notable items primarily in the prior year and markets revenue was down million or yearonyear expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear primarily driven by higher compensation expense including wage inflation and higher legal expense and credit costs of billion included net chargeoffs of billion predominantly in card jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 the net reserve build included a million build in the commercial bank a million build in card and a million release in corporate all of which i will cover in more detail later on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of flat versus the prior quarter as the benefit of net income less distributions was offset by the impact of first republic and as you can see in the two charts on the page weve given you some information about the impact of the transaction on both rwa and cet1 ratio and as you know we completed ccar a couple of weeks ago our new indicative scb is versus our current requirement of and it goes into effect in the new scb also reflects the boards intention to increase the dividend to per share in the third quarter on liquidity our bank lcr for the second quarter ended at in line with what we anticipated at investor day about half of the reduction is associated with the first republic transaction and while were on the balance sheet as we previewed in the 10k we will be updating our earnings and risk model to incorporate the impact of deposit repricing lags so when we release this quarters 10q you will see the up 100basis point parallel shift scenario will be about positive billion whereas in the absence of the change it would have been about negative billion now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page both us consumers and small businesses remain resilient and we havent observed any meaningful changes to the trends in our data we discussed at investor day turning now to financial results which i will speak to excluding the impact of first republic for ccb cb and aum ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion and was up yearonyear in banking wealth management revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher nii on higher rates end ofperiod deposits were down quarteronquarter as customers continue to spend down their cash buffers including for seasonal tax payments and seek higheryielding products client investment assets were up yearonyear driven by market performance and strong net inflows across our advisor and digital channels in home lending revenue was down yearonyear driven by lower nii from tighter loan spreads and lower servicing and production revenue originations were up quarteronquarter driven by seasonality although still down yearonyear moving to card services auto revenue was up largely driven by higher card services nii on higher revolving balances partially offset by lower auto lease income card outstandings were up yearonyear which was the result of revolve normalization and strong and new account growth and in auto originations were up billion up yearonyear as competitors pulled back and inventories continue to slowly recover expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by compensation predominantly due to wage inflation and head count growth as we continue to invest in our front office and technology staffing as well as marketing in terms of credit performance this quarter our credit costs were billion reflecting the reserve build of million driven by loan growth in card services net charge offs were billion up million yearonyear predominantly driven by card as dayplus delinquencies have returned to prepandemic levels in line with our expectations next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear or down excluding bridge book markdowns in the prior year ib fees were down yearonyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were down underwriting fees were down for debt and up for equity with more positive momentum in the last month of the quarter in terms of the second half outlook we have seen encouraging signs of activity in capital markets and july should be a good indicator for the remainder of the year however yeartodate announced ma is down significantly which will be a headwind moving to markets total revenue was billion down yearonyear fixed income was down as expected the macro franchise substantially normalized from last years elevated levels of volatility and client jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 flows this was largely offset by improved performance in the securitized products group and credit equity markets was down against a very strong prioryear quarter particularly in derivatives payments revenue was billion up yearonyear excluding equity investments it was up predominantly driven by higher rates partially offset by lower deposit balances security services revenue of billion and was up yearonyear driven by higher rates partially offset by lower fees expenses of billion were up yearon year driven by higher noncompensation expense as well as wage inflation and head count growth largely offset by lower revenuerelated compensation moving to the commercial bank on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins payments revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher rates gross investment banking and markets revenue of million was down yearonyear primarily driven by fewer large ma deals expenses of billion were up yearon year predominantly driven by higher compensation expense including front office hiring and technology investments as well as higher volumerelated expense average deposits were up quarteronquarter driven by inflows related to client acquisition partially offset by continued attrition in nonoperating deposits loans were up quarteronquarter ci loans were up reflecting stabilization in new loan demand and revolver utilization in the current economic environment as well as pockets of growth in areas where we are investing cre loans were also up reflecting funding on prioryear originations for construction loans and real estate banking as well as increased affordable housing activity finally credit costs were million net chargeoffs were million including million in the office real estate portfolio and the net reserve build of million was driven by updates to certain assumptions related to the office real estate market as well as net downgrade activity in middle market banking then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins on lower balances and higher management fees on strong net inflows expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by higher compensation including growth in our private banking advisor teams higher revenuerelated compensation and the impact of global shares and jpmorgan asset management in china both of which closed within the last year for the quarter record net longterm inflows were billion positive across all channels regions and asset classes led by fixed income and equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion aum of trillion was up yearonyear and overall client assets of trillion were up yearonyear driven by continued net inflows higher market levels and the impact of the acquisition of global shares and finally loans were down quarteronquarter driven by lower securitiesbased lending and deposits were down turning to corporate on page as i noted upfront we are reporting the first republic bargain purchase gain and substantially all of the expenses in corporate excluding those items corporate reported net income of million revenue was million up million compared to last year nii was billion up billion yearonyear due to the impact of higher rates nir was a net loss of million and included the net investment securities losses i mentioned upfront expenses of million were up million yearonyear largely driven by higher legal expense and credit costs were a net benefit of million reflecting a reserve release of the deposit placed with first republic in the first quarter was eliminated as part of the transaction jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 next the outlook on page we now expect nii and nii ex markets to be approximately billion with the increase driven by higher rates coupled with slower deposit reprice than previously assumed across both consumer and wholesale and i should take the opportunity to remind you once again that significant sources of uncertainty remain and we do expect the nii run rate to be substantially below this quarters run rate at some point in the future as competition for deposits plays out our expense outlook for remains approximately billion and on credit we continue to expect the card net chargeoff rate to be approximately so to wrap up we are proud of the exceptionally strong operating results this quarter as we look forward we remain focused on the significant uncertainties relating to the economic outlook competition for deposits and the impact on capital from the pending finalization of the basel iii rules nonetheless despite the likely headwinds ahead we remain optimistic about the companys ability to continue delivering excellent performance through a range of scenarios with that operator please open the line for qa question and answer section operator please stand by the first question is coming from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc thanks good morning hey jeremy you talked about nii guidance up clearly fed funds futures are up so it makes some sense but maybe i guess first could you kind of discuss i guess comment on deposit behavior broadly around betas and mix and what youre seeing there so far it seems to be coming in a little better than expected and then secondly and probably more importantly can you help us think about the implications of higherfor longer rates on the outlook for nii next year and beyond i guess the intermediate term outlook that you guys had talked about jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure thanks jim so yeah so when we talk about the drivers of the upward revision as i said its higher rates coupled with lower deposit reprice hard to untangle the two drivers and specifically i think when you look at the consumer the combination of the passage of time and the positive feedback were getting from the field and the cd offerings in particular has meant that its quite a kind of stable environment from that perspective and similarly in wholesale were just seeing slower internal migrations you asked about mix i think that obviously were seeing the cd mix increase and we would expect that to continue to take place probably even past the peak of the rate cycle into next year as we continue to capture money in motion but as you say the most important point is the fact that as i said earlier we dont consider this level of nii generation to be sustainable and we talked previously about a sort of mediumterm run rate in the mid that was before first republic and you could argue that maybe that number should be a little higher but whatever it is its a lot lower than the jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 current number we dont know when thats going to happen were not going to predict the exact moment thats going to be a function of competitive dynamics in the marketplace but we want to be clear that we do expect it at some point jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay but i guess just one followup on that just if we dont get rate cuts till middle of next year or later does that sort of give some confidence to the outlook for next year or are you still worried about significant reprice jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i wouldnt necessarily assume that the evolution from the current run rate into that mid number is that sensitive to the rate outlook in particular when we put that number out there we looked at a range of different types of rate environments and the reprice that we think would be associated with that it was really meant to capture more of what we consider to be a throughthecycle sustainable number so i wouldnt think of it as being particularly ratedependent jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc okay great thanks operator next well go to the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning jeremy im just laughing to myself because i said to you at investor day any more nii rabbits to pull out of the hat and i guess you do so i guess i want to ask a broader question really here and maybe jamie id like to get your thoughts so you earned rotce on cet1 and we hear you loud and clear that youre more normalized nii generation is not billion that being said and fully taking into account the potential haircut from basel iii endgame is it possible that your natural rotce is maybe above that throughthecycle rate when rates arent zero because when you first introduced that rotce target we were in a different world from a rate scenario and everybodys talking about even if the fed cuts the natural sort of bottom in fed funds is not going to be zero so any input on that would be great jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks erika i mean its a good question theres a lot in there obviously i guess i would start by saying that when we talked about the throughthecycle rotce even though we may have introduced that in a moment when we were at the lower zero bound it was always premised on a sort of normalized rate environment and at some level that remains true today furthermore you didnt ask this explicitly but in the context of the proposed basel iii endgame one relevant question might be if you have a lot more capital in the denominator what happens to that target so i think as i said in my prepared remarks we feel very confident about the companys ability to produce excellent returns through the cycle theres a lot of moving parts right now in that some of them could be good some of them could be bad jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 narrowly on the capital one the one thing to point out is that the straightup math of simply diluting down the rotce by expanding the denominator misses the possibility of reprice repricing of products and services which of course goes back to our point that these capital increases do have impacts on the real economy so were not suggesting that we can price our way out of it but we obviously need to get the right returns on products and services and where we have pricing power we will adjust to the higher capital so a lot of moving parts in there but i think the important point is that through a range of scenarios we feel good about our ability to deliver good results and well see how the mix of all the various factors plays out especially after we see the basel iii proposal and then go through the comment period jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and erika i would just add one thing we do have a mix of businesses that earn from like rotce to we have some which are very capitalintensive so we look at kind of all of them and i think is a good number and a good target the other thing were earning on is credit weve been overearning credit for a substantial amount of time now were quite conscious about it we know that its going to pick up just as it normalizes considerably more than now look we would consider credit card normalizing to be closer to erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and so my followup question there maybe jeremy could you remind us what unemployment rate is embedded in your acl ratio as of the second quarter jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its still erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator next well go to the line of john mcdonald from autonomous research you may proceed john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning jeremy wanted to ask about capital in the wake of the barr speech we dont have the details yet but just kind of wanted to ask about options that you have and strategies for mitigation both on rwa and potentially on the gsib front as well as you contemplate what you heard recently jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah thanks john so obviously were thinking about that a lot on the other hand as much as there have been a lot of very detailed rumors out there that might lead you to start to try to do some planning it does seem like this time its real and we actually are going to get ph a foothold presumably sometime this month or something so soon enough well get to see something actually on paper and we can stop kind of the guesswork having said that indulging in a little bit of guesswork it does seem like the biggest single driver of the increase that people are talking about including chair powells number or vice chair barr but vice chair jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 barr is of rwa which winds up being roughly the same is just the way the operational risk is getting introduced into the standardized pillar and that is a little bit of a straightup acrosstheboard tax on everything its kind of hard to optimize your way out of that with the exception obviously of the fact that you can simply increase price assuming you have pricing power but thats obviously not what we want and thats what we sort of mean by impacts on the real economy so there are details theres a lot of the rtb stuff we can get way into the weeds there within the markets business and we do have a good track record of adjusting and optimizing but this time around it may be a more fundamental set of questions around business mix as opposed to the ability to sort of optimize in a very technical way john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thats helpful and with a number of years for this to phase in and you generating capital at a high level even if the rotce comes down a bit how should we think about your pace of building capital for these new changes versus doing your everyday course of investing and buybacks and things like that over the next couple years jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean i guess im sort of tempted to give you our standard capital hierarchy here i mean were not going to ph sacrifice investments right that wont come as a surprise to you generally speaking were always going to try to comply with new requirements early so when we know the requirements and when we have visibility obviously given how much organic capital were generating right now whatever the answer winds up being itll be pretty easy to comply narrowly speaking but thats not the same as saying that there wont be consequences to returns or to pricing and if for whatever reason things arent exactly as were anticipating i dont see us sacrificing investments that we see as strategically critical in order to comply with higher capital requirements ahead of the formal timing or whatever john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and theres some room for buybacks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co its unlikely obviously that would be an unlikely outcome john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sorry john go ahead did you have a followup john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 yeah no just do buybacks play a role in the next couple years strategically do you episodically buy back jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i mean capital hierarchy again right in the end when we have nothing else to do with the money well do buybacks and we talked about the billion for this year obviously a lot of new moving parts there although all else equal given what weve done so far thats still probably a reasonable number for the full year but yeah thats always going to be at the end of the list but yeah john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it okay thank you operator next well go to the line of ken usdin from jefferies you may proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i just wanted to ask a little bit about how youre feeling about the tradeoff between like the commercial economy and what might come through in terms of future loan growth versus the kind of green shoots that people are talking about in the investment banking pipeline and just how it feels in terms of like re opening of markets and the tradeoff between getting some more of those fees in versus whats happening on the loan demand side thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure good question ken so i think in terms of investment banking and markets yeah better than expected last month what i would talk about green shoots especially in capital markets generally still definitely some headwinds in ma lower announced activity some regulatory headwinds there so well see i think its a little too early to call a trend there based on recent results but well see in terms of the broader economy and loan growth expectations generally we do still expect reasonably robust card loan growth but away from that for a variety of different reasons and different products whether it be mortgage or ci after revolver normalization and especially if we see a little bit of a cooling off of the economy i would expect loan demand to be relatively modest there so were not really expecting meaningful growth away from card but of course were there for the right deals right products right terms we lend through the cycle so i see that as more of a demanddriven narrative which will be a function of the economy rather than any tightening on our side ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc that makes sense and as a followup to that on the consumer side you mentioned that consumers continue to spend albeit a little more slowly and you mentioned that consumers are also using their excess deposits a little bit more as well can you just elaborate a little bit more on just your feeling about the state of the consumer and is that card growth continue to be driven by people needing to revolve as opposed to wanting to have more in their deposits just kind of what the tradeoff on that side is too jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean to us i think we still see this as a normalization not deterioration story when we talk about consumer credit actually revolve per account has still not gotten to prepandemic levels actually so i would definitely say that its a wanting rather than needing at least for our portfolio at this point and yeah i think the consumer continues to surprise on the upside here ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you operator next well go to the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jeremy good morning jamie jeremy can you give us your view on how youre measuring the treasury functions and the asset liability of your balance sheet as we go forward versus the way you guys were positioning and managing it a year ago in view of the fact that it looks like maybe were approaching terminal rate on fed funds rates jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah gerard i would say honestly not much changed there actually we have been pretty consistently concerned about the risk of higher rates of course we always try to position things to produce reasonable outcomes across a broad range of scenarios but at the margin weve been biased towards higher rates and that may be a little less true at these levels than it was before although a lot of that is just the consequence of deposit ph comeback strategy playing out in the modeling but in any case all else equal i think we are going to continue to focus on making sure were fine in a higher rate scenario while staying balanced across a range of scenarios so not really a lot of change in our positioning and thats obviously including the fact that we took on first republic which even net of some of the liabilities had a long structural interest rate position we did not actually want to get longer as part of the deal and so as a result we took actions to ensure that netnet we are still about the same as we were last quarter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you mentioned in giving us the readthrough on the commercial banking segment of the business that you had some reserve building tied to some office real estate and also some downgrades in the middle market area can you go a little deeper what are you guys seeing in this area of both commercial real estate but also the ci loans whats happening in that segment as well jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i would caution you from drawing too broad a conclusion from this i mean i think that when we talk about office first for example our portfolio as you know is quite small and our exposure to sort of socalled urban dense office is even smaller the vast majority of our overall portfolio is multifamily lending so as a result like our sample size of observed valuations on office properties is quite small but you know we like to be sort of jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 ahead of the cycle and based on everything that we saw this quarter it just felt reasonable to build a little bit there to get to what felt like a comfortable coverage ratio in the middle market segment we saw downgrades in excess of upgrades but i dont see that as sort of necessarily indicative of anything terribly significant in the broader readacross ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator next well go to the line of steve chubak from wolfe research please go ahead jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co steve are you there operator it looks like his line dropped so next well go to the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america you may proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch good morning i guess just first question following up on the outlook for the economy like weve all been worried about the recession for a year and theres a debate about the lagged effects of the fed rate hike cycle when you think about jeremy i think you mentioned your unemployment outlook relatively similar today versus a quarter ago how worried should we be in terms of the credit cycle to months from now or are you leaning towards concluding that maybe us businesses consumers have absorbed the rate cycle a lot better than we expected a year ago jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i mean im sure jamie has some views here but in my view i would just caution against jumping to too many superpositive conclusions based on a couple of recent prints and i think generally our point is less about trying to predict a particular outcome and more about trying to make sure that we dont get too much euphoria that overconcentrates people on one particular prediction when we know that theres a range of outcomes out there so obviously people are talking a lot about the potential for selflending right now no lending immaculate disinflation or whatever and whether our own views on that have changed meaningfully i dont know but the broader point is that we continue to be quite focused on jamies prior comment that loss rates still have room to normalize even postpandemic so were probably overearning on credit a little bit obviously weve talked about the expectation that the nii is going to come down quite a bit so even forgetting about whether you get some surprisingly negative outcomes on the economy from where we stand today even in the central case you just need to recognize that there should be some significant normalization jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 yeah and i would just add that the is not our prediction that is the average of the unemployment under multiple scenarios that we have to use which are hypothetical for cecl indiscernible something different and we dont know the outcome were trying to be really clear here the consumer is in good shape theyre spending down their excess cash thats all tailwinds there even if we go into recession were going with rather good conditions low borrowings and good house price values still but the headwinds are substantial and somewhat unprecedented theres war in ukraine oil gas quantitative tightening unprecedented fiscal needs of governments qt which we never experienced before and i just think people should take a deep breath on that we dont know if those things could put us in a soft landing a mild recession or a hard recession and obviously we shall hope for the best ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch got it and just a followup on the upcoming basel reforms two questions youve talked about the impact to the us economy like others have said the same at this point is that falling on deaf ears and secondly maybe jeremy if you can touch upon just structural changes that you expect to make in the capital markets business because of frtb thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so on your first point i mean i think you can just read vice chair barrs speech right ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch yeah jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co he addressed that point fairly directly he clearly doesnt agree as it is his right so well see what happens we continue to feel that all else equal higher capital requirements definitely are going to increase the cost of credit which is bad for the economy so well see what happens on that on frtb its really very nuanced its probably like too much detail for this call to be honest but just to give you like one immaterial and insignificant but useful example one product under frtb is yield curve spread options and if the frtb proposal goes through as currently written that product just becomes not viable so obviously if we need to stop doing that product no one really cares but its just one example of the way sometimes when youre really disciplined about allocating capital thoroughly all the way down to individual products and responding accordingly you can wind up having to change your business mix there are obviously more significant products that matter much more for the real economy like mortgage where the layeringon of the operational risk and the way its being proposed especially if some of the other beneficial elements of the proposal dont come through youre once again making that product even harder to offer to homeowners so well see well see what happens jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i would just add to that even if your product doesnt make money you might do it for clients who are great clients youre going to manage it by product by client and by effectively business mix and those are the adjustments jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 roughly loans dont make sense to put in your balance sheet as a whole almost any loan and people have to recognize that and so we just have to manage through all of the various complications here and ph we dont know what the hell to do ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merill lynch okay thank you operator next well go to the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i had another question on vice chair barrs speech from this week to the extent that capital ratios do go up for you and perhaps others to what degree would you think about changing your business model in terms of remixing where you do business repricing or simply removing activities that you used to do its kind of ironic or maybe its not ironic that apollo hits an alltime stock price high at the same week of the speech so how much business leaves jpmorgan or the industry if capital ratios do go up as much as potentially proposed jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah mike i mean jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co wait before jeremy answers the question this is great news for hedge funds private equity private credit apollo blackstone and theres dancing in the streets jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah exactly and i was going to say mike yes to everything so meaning repricing yes definitely to the extent that we have pricing power and the higher capital requirements mean that were not generating the right returns for shareholders we will try to reprice and well see how that sticks and how that flows into the economy and how that affects demand for products and if the repricing is not successful then in some cases we will have to remix and that means getting out of certain products and services and as jamie points out that probably means that those products and services leave the regulator perimeter and go into elsewhere and thats fine as jamie points out those people are clients and i think that point was addressed also in vice chair barrs speech but traditionally having risky activities leave the regulator perimeter has had some negative consequences so these are all important things to consider mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right and separate question i appreciate the investor day gives a little bit more color on the degree that your investments may or may not pan out we are still all watching that closely having said that you just increased revenue guidance by billion for nii between this quarter and the first quarter without changing expense guidance by even arent you tempted to spend a little bit more why not spend more if youre gaining share jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 and im not saying that you should im just wondering like arent you tempted to do so you have billion more revenues and youre not spending more of expenses like why not jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co mike let me get this right youre actually complaining that our expenses arent high enough is that right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc wait wait just to be clear its just the flip side of the question i asked for two years going back jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co fair enough i appreciate the balance in all seriousness weve always been pretty clear right that our spending is throughthecycle spending based on throughthecycle investment throughthecycle spending based on our throughthecycle view of the earningsgenerating power of the company and the goal to produce the right returns so broadly speaking nii tends to flow straight through to the bottom line both when its going up and by the way when its going down too and weve been through those moments as you well remember so whether or not there are opportunities to deploy some more dollars into marketing and stuff like that we have actually looked at that recently i dont see that being a meaningful item this year which is part of why we have not revised the expense guidance so far but this is about investing through the cycle and being honest and disciplined about which revenue items carry expense loading and which of them dont mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then last quick followup jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co mike i think were kind of running as fast as we can so if you actually sat down directly with credit compliance auto market bankers recruiters trainers mike this is it were full effort right now and we want to make sure we get things right and get things thoughtful and careful so its not just the money its the people and how many things you change all at once and add all at once mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one quick followup to that your efficiency ratio this quarter is the lowest weve seen in a long long time and i guess youre saying dont extrapolate this efficiency ratio because nii will come down at some point but when you just simply look at you benchmark yourself against the lowcost providers where do you think youre there now and where can you still go because if you extrapolate this quarter youre getting closer jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 yeah i mean you said it yourself right you definitely can extrapolate the current numbers but i think more broadly on benchmarking ourselves to lowcost providers it sort of speaks to an area that youve been interested in for a long time which is all of the investment that were doing in technology to improve generally scalability and get more of our cost base to be variable versus fixed in terms of how we respond to volumes thats a big part of the reason that were doing the investments that were doing in modernization and cloud and ai and all the type of stuff that weve talked about a lot so i think we feel really good about our efficiency as a company but there definitely is room for improvement mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator next well go to the line of steven chubak from wolfe research you may proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey thanks for taking the question and apologies for the technical issues earlier wanted to ask on the deposit outlook just with signs that recent liquidity drawdown has come predominantly out of rrp versus industry deposits just wanted to get your thoughts on what expectations you have for deposit growth in the second half both for you and even the broader industry especially as treasury issuance really begins to ramp in earnest jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah good question steve so let me say a couple things about this so obviously our deposit numbers have bounced around a little bit as a function of some of the turmoil that we saw in regional banks as well as obviously the first republic transaction but now if you look at our kind of endofperiod deposits this quarter and you project forward our core view is that we would expect a sort of modest downward trend to reassert itself from this higher starting point broadly as a function of qt playing through the system but noting that we do have some hope for offsets by taking share just to give a couple examples like in consumer weve got some of our branch expansion markets seasoning and so there are share opportunities there and in wholesale we obviously invested a lot in products and services and so we think we have compelling offerings that are helping us win mandates and so there are potentially some share offsets there but broadly our core view remains modest deposit declines across the franchise within that you noted the same thing weve noted that as we got through the debt ceiling and the tga build has come into effect and youve seen a lot of bill issuance big question in the market about whether that was going to come out of reserve or come out of rrp and so far with most of the tga build i guess theyre targeting billion and theyre at billion or something so theyre almost done more of it than some people feared has come out of rrp so as you say i think thats a relatively good sign and highlight so the system works better when youve got ample supply of shortdated collateral on the front end of the yield curve so that whole rrptga bank reserve dynamic is going to continue to be significant but it is good to see rrp coming down a little bit steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 helpful color and just a followup on card income revenues were muted in the quarter i was hoping you could unpack just the sources of pressure maybe more specifically how much of a drag is associated with indiscernible versus some other factors jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so actually that card income number steve is a little bit of a oneoff thing so we had a reward liability adjustment this quarter kind of a technical thing so thats just a temporary headwind and also the sequential comparison is also getting hurt by a small positive oneoff item in the prior period and obviously i know you guys looked at it but card income isnt sort of a thing we look at that much ourselves steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc can you size the reward liability impact jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co why dont you get mikael to give that to you its not that significant but its enough to just make the sequential number look a little bit wonky steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc great thanks for taking my questions operator next well go to the line of glenn schorr from evercore isi you may proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you just want to followup on this pricing power conversation because youve been consistent over time that you have a limited ability to sustain pricing power due to the competitive landscape but i guess my question is if not now when meaning a lot has changed on the institutional side the european bank side the regional bank side and i would think that there would be certain businesses that you have a greater ability and willingness to push price on and then maybe you could tie that to your comments in the press release on what are the material what are the realworld consequences for markets and end users that youre referring to when talking about material regulatory changes thanks a lot jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so look on pricing power youre right it really depends on the product and it depends on the competitive landscape across different banks and so its very granular its very productspecific and in some cases well have more pricing power than in other cases i think the overall point that were trying to make in connection with basel iii endgame is just that like we think the capital increases are excessive and it puts pressure on returns all else equal that obviously puts pressure on us to increase price where we can that is generally a bad thing for the real economy and how all that plays out in detail across different products and services remains to be seen importantly since we dont actually have the proposal yet so we need those details and sorry glenn i forgot the second half of your question what was it jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi actually i think you hit on it so ill just do a followup on a related so the notion of private credit doing large traditional investmentgrade lending activity is maybe part of the competitive landscape that limits the ability to push price in jamies letter you talked about the downside or my question is whats the downside if more of the mortgage credit assetbacked intermediation business is pushed out of the banking system jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i mean i guess it depends on what you mean by downside but i just think societally speaking i think weve seen in recent history that when home lending is happening outside the regulated perimeter and things get bad when you have economic downturns it produces bad outcomes for individuals and homeowners and society as a whole and jamie has written about this extensively beyond that financially weve talked about how mortgage lending i mean the profitability swings obviously is reasonably cyclical and the recent past has actually been very profitable than it was less so like the correspondent channel right now is actually picking up a little bit but its a thinmargin business its challenging and when you increase the capital requirements it makes it even harder so that just becomes one of the areas where youre in that tension between remixing versus pricing power that we talked about a second ago and it might in fact mean that we do less less credit available for homeowners and more regulatory risk as the activity moves outside the perimeter glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi appreciate that jeremy operator next well go to the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley you may proceed betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to unpack a little bit more the drivers of the change you outlined thats coming in the 10q jeremy regarding the asset sensitivity going from liabilitysensitive to assetsensitive at least thats the way i read it i just wanted to understand what the drivers of that is jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 yeah sure no problem betsy i mean as you know thats always been a challenging number its meant as a risk management measure of sorts although its also somewhat limited in that respect and it has been an uneven usefulness in terms of a tool to be able to predict our nii trajectory when rates change but as weve looked at that and try to improve it and spoken to all of you through this latest rate hiking cycle weve come to the conclusion that it would improve the usefulness of the disclosure if we included in the modeling the effect of deposit repricing lags and so weve done that and that just has the effect that i talked about it increases the ph ear number by about billion from minus billion which is roughly what it was last quarter and what it wouldve been this quarter without the change to something more like billion betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so then jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co all the usual caveats apply right i mean its never the answer is going to always for any given change in rates the change in our nii is always going to be for one reason or another different from what that disclosure shows but we do our best betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and so is it fair for me to think about that change as a marktomarket to where we are today and when i think about your forward guide here longerterm youre saying look deposit betas are accelerating so as i go through the 10qs over the next four five quarters i should expect that that billion should come down because deposit betas youre anticipating are going to be accelerating from here im just trying to put those two things together jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a good question its quite a technical issue so i think in the past the way this number was constructed was to assume throughthecycle betas on all the deposits and so your notion that like the number would include deposit beta acceleration would not have been the case because it wouldve been using essentially terminal deposit betas based on the forward curve and then based on a shock to the forward curve the nuance that weve introduced now is to recognize that given the shock the reprice that the beta predicts will not be instantaneous and so you get sort of just the mathematical consequences of that but i think translating that into a statement about our expectation for beta for the next months relative to our nii guide might be a bridge too far im not sure you can actually ph draw that conclusion betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right but you were saying earlier deposit betas you do anticipate are going to be accelerating from here and thats part of the outlook for nii longerterm to normalize in the mid is that right jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes but let me emphasize on that go ahead jamie jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean basically yes as you have if the next round is going to be the beta will be to to bps i mean whatever the product is yeah thats the lag and the billion will go down over time as that actually happens if rates actually go up if rates dont actually go up that billion may be exactly billion again jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co exactly and what i was going to say betsy is just that the projection of the billion coming down to a significantly lower number contains both the element of internal migration as well as the potential which is by no means guaranteed of productlevel reprice and furthermore then obviously the dynamics are a little bit different in the different business segments as you move from large corporate wholesale to consumer betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you appreciate it jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah operator next well go to the line of matt oconnor from deutsche bank you may proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so im in your camp that eventually consumers will want more deposit rate sensitivity here but i guess what would make you change your rates meaningfully so the top two banks have about consumer market share loantodeposit ratios are low your outlook for loan growth and i think others is fairly sluggish at least outside of card i get that its common sense and thats what weve seen historically but there really is this kind of big divergence among big banks and everybody else where the big banks just dont need to pay that much for deposits for a slew of reasons so what would make you change that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah in the end matt its just feedback from the field its competition and feedback from the field we jamie go ahead jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think every bank is in a different position about what they need and so you have a whole range of outcomes but remember we do this also by city so you have different competition in arizona phoenix sic phoenix arizona than you have in chicago illinois and we do have high interest rates products so its a combination of all those things i wouldnt call it big bank versus small bank and youre going to see whenever we report who kind of paid up a little more for things and who didnt and things like that so look guys i would take it as a given i think its a mistake there is very little pricing power in most of our business and betas are going to go up take it as a given there is no circumstance that weve ever seen in the history of banking where rates didnt get to a certain point that you had competing products and rates go up through migration or direct rates or movement to cds or money market funds were going to have to compete for that you already see it in parts of our business and not in other parts matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah i jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah indiscernible matt its really just about primary bank relationships in the end thats the core of the strategy matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah i mean again i agree but weve never seen kind of loanstodeposit ratios for banks like yours this low so you could just let deposits run off at a modest amount for quite some time and make the decision not to pay up i mean i see thats the tradeoff and eventually youll jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but thats a little more complicated because a lot of that loantovalue ratio is lower because of regulatory stuff lcr capital ratio etcetera matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay all right thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator and for our final question well go to charles peabody from portales partners you may proceed charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 good morning jeremy on page of your presentation you show some liquidity metrics and theres been a meaningful deterioration or i shouldnt say deterioration depletion of some of that excess liquidity obviously for first republic primarily so my question is how quickly do you want to rebuild that liquidity because as i look out towards theres probably a half dozen variables that are going to make liquidity a premium event to have excess liquidity so thats my first question whats your plans for replenishing that liquidity jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah charles so i know we talked about this a little bit at investor day right so as i said in my prepared remarks yeah we think about half of the change in the bank lcr number is a consequence of first republic and the rest of it is just the expected decrease in systemwide deposits flowing through into our indiscernible balances in the bank lcr ratio so thats all entirely as expected and therefore i think that the replenishing notion is not correct in fact obviously we still have ample ample liquidity now if you want to project trends forward thats a different story but thats sort of the business of banking well adjust accordingly in terms of our asset and liability mix across different products and to ensure compliance to the ratios and fortress balance sheet principles as you would expect from us jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and i would just add just look at the top of the page in the press release trillion of cash and marketable securities even if we get down to no excess were going to have like i got the exact number trillion i think we have excess liquidity and the liquidity ratio is slightly something different i think theres plenty of liquidity in the system and of course we do multiple things to change this overnight if we wanted to charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut all right so sort of wrapped into that as a followup if you take your billion forecast for nii this year and that implies at least one quarter of maybe billion of nii and you take your eventual forecast of mid70 billion of nii at some point in the future that would imply at least one quarter of billion of nii so thats about an drop and if you hold the balance sheet steady youre talking about a 30basis point drop in your margin your nim to get from billion to billion i mean what is driving is it really the deposit or are you thinking in terms of interest reversals as credit deteriorates or is it rebuilding of liquidity im just trying to get a better sense of the impact is jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah hey charlie i would think about that as being really entirely a deposit story its just not that complicated right i think we did this i think it was either in the fourth quarter or in the first quarter where we put a little chart on a page just very simple terms that shows like what the dollar consequences are of whatever like a 10basis point change in deposit rate paid in terms of nii run rate so whether its as a consequence of migration from loweryielding to higheryielding going from to a cd is obviously a big impact on margin or whether its because savings reprices relatively small changes in rate there are kind of a lot of money when youve got a couple trillion dollars of deposits so its really not any more complicated than that and thats why were being so forceful about reminding people about what we expect that trajectory to be charles w peabody q analyst portales partners llc connecticut jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2023 thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you very much jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thank you guys operator thank you all for
