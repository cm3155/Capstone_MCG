management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investors and analysts conference call for hsbc holdings plcs earnings release for for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to your host mr noel quinn group chief executive noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you and good morning in london good afternoon in hong kong and thank you all for joining us let me start by saying that im pleased with our third quarter performance and the way that our business and our people have continued to respond to a challenging environment were doing all we can to support our customers communities and colleagues through the ebb and flow of covid restrictions and are committed to helping them manage the uncertainty that remains as far as our business is concerned we are more optimistic than when we last spoke in july economic forecasts are looking brighter particularly in asia as you can see from our q3 results expected credit losses have now stabilized and weve got a clear plan to accelerate growth and adapt the business to the ultralow interest rate environment hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 looking further ahead we are also committed to helping our clients make the transition to a low carbon economy youll have seen our announcement two weeks ago that were aiming to align our financed emissions to the paris agreement goal to achieve net zero by or sooner the covid19 pandemic has been a huge wakeup call for us all and a climate crisis has the potential to be much more drastic in its consequences and longevity were therefore stepping up support for our clients in a material way as we work together to build a thriving low carbon economy and focus in every part of our business on helping achieve that goal turning to our third quarter performance these were promising results set against the continuing economic impacts of covid19 with significantly smaller expected credit losses good strategic progress a growing capital ratio good customer retention and an improved economic outlook our asia businesses continue to show good resilience contributing billion of reported pretax profit and global markets grew adjusted revenue by versus last years third quarter our capital markets revenue is up yeartodate on the back of strong collaboration across commercial banking and global banking and markets and our global markets revenues are up yeartodate largely in the areas we have targeted for continued investment our profitability was challenged by the impact of interest rate reductions earlier in the year on our deposit franchises across all our global businesses as a result reported pretax profits of billion were down and adjusted profits were down on last years third quarter ecls of million were down significantly on the previous two quarters and broadly stable versus the same period last year we maintained a firm grip on costs down on last years third quarter with an ambition to go further than previously promised deposits of trillion were higher than last years third quarter we strengthened our capital ratio further to and despite headwinds we made good progress in reducing riskweighted assets in lowreturning areas and reducing our cost base in a sustainable way turning to slide the revenue impact of lowerforlonger interest rates is going to continue over coming quarters as the impact of interest rate cuts unwinds through the pl in response were accelerating all areas of our strategy with a particular focus on boosting sustainable noninterest income and going further on costs the three main levers for this are going to be an acceleration and an increase in our investment in and across asia faster digitization through higher levels of technology investments and the extensive restructuring of the businesses we talked about in february starting with asia as you can see from slide asia is rebounding strongly much more than the rest of the world given our ability to connect the world to asia and support growth in the region our asian opportunity is growing and were stepping up the investment to capture it previously just under half of our growth investment was aimed at asia now a large majority of our future growth investment will go to growing our asia wealth wholesale and sustainability franchises as well as reinforcing our position in hong kong and extending our position across the greater bay area and south asia in the last months asias share of group riskweighted assets increased by percentage points to and that number will keep growing as we reallocate additional capital to the region as a whole our recent investments have helped launch new initiatives aimed at supporting both our clients and business growth these include visiongo a platform connecting sme service providers and customers in hong kong which has onboarded more than members since its launch in april pinnacle supported by its new fintech subsidiary which is a first for a foreign financial institution in china and in southeast asia a new capability to onboard smes to multiple markets simultaneously as well as a new multicurrency digital wallet for international smes piloted by glcm business in singapore hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 our asian franchise saw more good growth in the quarter with higher deposits and stable lending supported by strong credit quality but we can go much further and were backing up our ambition with investment to match turning to slide our technology investment is critical not just to provide new capabilities to our customers but also to boost the efficiency and reduce longterm costs for that reason well maintain technology investment throughout the cycle even as we reduce spending elsewhere hsbc is already a substantially digital bank a large proportion of our global payments already flow through digital channels and downloads of hsbcnet are up for the first nine months of the year but we have further opportunities to meet growing market need for sophisticated robust rapid payment solutions and to lead our industry in applying digital solutions to analog services like trade despite the current economic environment we forecast to spend more in on technology than ever before including investments to further digitize our key retail and wealth platforms enhance transaction banking for high net worth clients in asia build the new trade services operating model fit for a digital future build and expand hsbc kinetic a uk mobile sme bank that uses cloud to deliver a faster sameday service for customers and launch and enhance hsbc evolve a new fx execution platform enabling greater collaboration and better digital solutions for large and small corporate clients this investment is helping to redesign our cost base while building the future of hsbc and we wont sacrifice it for shortterm gain moving to slide were making good progress in restructuring our us and european businesses achieving billion of rwa saves largely through actions in global banking and markets and around million of cost program savings so far this year in the us michael roberts and the team have already reduced rwas by yearonyear adjusted costs by ftes by and branches by more than im pleased with his progress so far but given the current economic climate we are looking at options to accelerate well provide an update on this at our full year results in february in our nonringfenced bank in the uk and europe nuno matos and the team have delivered more than billion of gross rwa saves reduced ftes and contractors by and initiated plans to reduce global banking and market ftes in our european hub in france by the strategic review of our french retail operations is ongoing but nearing completion we will announce the outcome by our fullyear results in february in the meantime we have announced the acquisition of the minority interest in hsbc germany enabling us to fully integrate the largest and most exportorientated european market into our strategy and business model the combination of our current progress and increased ambition means that we now expect to exceed our billion rwa gross reduction target in with around billion of that total expected by the end of in summary then our to transformation plan is fully on track and well go further and faster wherever we can we are pushing harder on costs and now expect to beat our target to reduce group costs to billion or lower in we expect to achieve around billion of lowperforming rwa gross reductions by the end of and to exceed our billion target by the end of we will provide an update on our plans for our france and us businesses by our full year results and well provide an update on our dividend policy in february we are working hard to get back to being able to pay dividends and we seek to pay a conservative dividend if circumstances allow with respect to the financial year the boards decision on whether to pay a dividend will depend on economic conditions in early and be subject to regulatory consultation hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 with that ill pass over to ewen to go through the numbers ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all against the continuing economic impact of covid19 these were a decent set of results which coupled with further good progress against our strategic objectives additional strengthening in our core tier ratio and tail risks in aggregate having diminished over recent months have noel and i in a more optimistic mood than last time we spoke at our second quarter results posttax profits of billion were down versus the third quarter last year were up materially on a weak second quarter adjusted revenues were down mainly reflecting the impact of interest rate reductions which impacted all of our global businesses and particularly our deposit franchises near zero interest rates will be a persistent revenue shock to our business over the next few years were actively adjusting our business model to address this building sources of noninterest income implementing asset side repricing where we can adjusting the revenue model for some product and customer segments and materially reducing our cost structure through digitization and automation ecl were significantly lower than the second quarter at million or basis points of gross loans with stage and stage allowances broadly unchanged with ecls at billion for the first nine months were now guiding to the lower end of our previously announced billion to billion range for the full year were continuing to take action on costs our adjusted operating costs fell by against the third quarter of last year and down yeartodate our balance sheet metrics continue to improve our core tier ratio was up a further basis points to in the quarter and customer deposits and lending were broadly stable from the second quarter with deposits up or billion yearonyear our tangible net asset value per share of was up on the second quarter due to both retained profits and currency movements turning to slide and looking across the three global businesses in wealth and personal banking revenues were down with retail banking revenues falling by just under billion due largely to the impact of falling interest rates on deposit margins at a headline level wealth management revenues grew by million but excluding positive market impacts in insurance manufacturing were down due mainly to lower insurance new business volumes commercial banking revenues were lower due mainly to the impact of lower margins on global liquidity and cash management in global banking and markets revenues were up despite the impact of lower interest rates global markets grew by reflecting continued good performance in credit and fx equity revenues also increased by looking forward assuming economies continue to rebound from covid19 lows we would expect some increase in corporate investment and loan growth from the low levels seen in second and third quarters this year we also expect global markets revenues to now normalize as volatility reduces and corporates complete their bond and equity fundraisings also dont forget the fourth quarter is normally a seasonally weaker quarter for revenues for us in both global markets and wealth on slide net interest income was billion thats down against the second quarter the net interest margin was basis points down on the second quarter basis point sorry reflecting the continuing hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 impact of near zero interest rates with our asian franchise in particular seeing material deposit spread compression the uk ringfenced bank nim was stable quarteronquarter excluding significant items as we look forward and assuming interest rates remain unchanged we expect further modest net interest income headwinds in the fourth quarter with some quarteronquarter stabilization from there we still expect approximately billion lower net interest income in versus on the next slide given the forward outlook for net interest income were focused on building our noninterest income revenues weve already substantial fee income businesses to invest in particularly in wealth and private banking were also one of the global leaders in fx and are increasingly building out our strength into asia for global markets and global banking were also looking at new revenue models in other areas such as global liquidity and cash management and retail banking that have previously relied on deposit spreads to drive economic returns fee income showed some recovery in the third quarter from the covidrelated lows seen earlier in the year up versus the second quarter turning to slide adjusted operating costs were lower than the third quarter in and down for the first nine months this continues to reflect the impact of our cost reduction actions and lower spending on discretionary cost line items as a result of covid19 relative to the plan we announced in february we now plan to exceed our cost targets set for with gross cost savings exceeding our previously announced billion in that year while still sustaining investment in technology spending in areas of focus in part this reflects changed customer and employee behavior as a result of covid19 namely substantially increased digital engagement from our customers and using the benefits of technology to adopt a hybrid working model for most of our employees with materially lower internal travel requirements going forward these customer and employee trends are also consistent with our sustainability goals opening up further opportunities to materially reduce our own carbon footprint in line with our commitment to be net zero operationally by to help achieve these additional cost savings we now plan to spend more than the billion in cost to achieve by with around billion of the total expected to be spent in well provide a more detailed and quantified plan in february when we announce our fullyear results on the next slide ecls were much lower than first half trends some million or basis points of gross loans this reflects a more stable economic outlook and a significant reserve build in the first half while overall ecl allowances remained broadly unchanged the stage and stage pl charge for the yeartodate is around billion of which just million was incurred in the third quarter the stage charge for the quarter was around million relating primarily to a small number of wholesale exposures across various sectors and a stable level of retail defaults this was partially offset by million of releases relating to precovid19 cases the million ecl charge we believe is unusually low at this point in the economic cycle benefiting from releases so i would discourage you from using this as a new baseline while ecls have started to stabilize we do still expect them to remain higherthannormalized levels over the coming quarters with ecls at billion for the first nine months for as a whole we now expect to be towards the lower end of the billion to billion range although uncertainties remain around the covid19 and brexit in particular on slide our core tier ratio at the end of the third quarter was up basis points in the quarter this was driven by rwa reductions on a constant currency basis profit generation and fx translation differences hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 excluding fx movements rwas fell by billion primarily as a result of our riskweighted asset reduction program as previously signaled at the second quarter and relative to guidance we gave in february weve made good progress this year on reducing portfolios of higher stress and enhancing capital levels at the holding company as such we now expect to be at a target of to core tier ratio when we can begin to normalize our core tier position again on slide were making good progress against our billion gross reduction target of lowerreturning risk weighted assets by the end of for the first nine months weve achieved billion and expect to achieve approximately half of the billion target by yearend as a result we now expect to exceed this target and to do so without exceeding our billion spend target that we announced in february so in summary against the backdrop of covid19 this was a decent quarter for us another resilient asian performance and a decent quarter for fixed income a more optimistic credit outlook and further progress on cost reduction and core tier build as we look out without discounting the continuing high levels of uncertainty we think the combination of tail risks has diminished relative to the last quarter and therefore were now more confident on the outlook we recognize that we still got a tough period ahead of us given the very material impact of near zero interest rates over the next few years coupled with a gradual recovery in customer activity in some segments from covid19 lows but we think the building blocks are now being put in place for a substantially enhanced returns in the coming years a changed revenue model that will be less reliant on deposit spreads a normalization of credit costs from highs lower operating costs using the benefits of digitalization and automation and increased confidence in being able to operate the bank of reduced capital levels once the economic environment stabilizes noel and i are very focused on the path back to paying dividends with a core tier ratio of relative to a target of to were now accruing meaningful capital buffers however i would caution about getting ahead of yourselves on distributions when we start well start conservatively and look to build sustainably from there with that sharon if we could please open up for questions hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions your first question comes from the line of raul sinha from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi raul raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning noel good morning ewen noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc afternoon a couple of questions from my side i guess starting off just on the nim and nii trajectory couple of points related to that one if you could talk a little bit about the hbap nim outlook obviously had quite a big fall in the quarter and then related to that if you could elaborate a little bit in terms of what you expect within your sort of planning assumptions for hibor are you expecting hibor to sort of stabilize around these levels or are you still thinking that we are going to converge towards us dollar libor which is obviously someway below where hibor is and the second one i guess a little bit more broader in terms of the areas where youre tweaking your transformation program and youve obviously talked about that a little bit i was particularly interested in wealth management and insurance in terms of what other growth initiatives you can focus to make a meaningful contribution given where your plan was when you announced it and where we are today and youve obviously got a big deficit in terms of revenues so any sort of commentary on wealth management and insurance sort of material growth opportunities would be really helpful thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay ill take the second question but ill ask ewen to answer the first part of the question if thats okay ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure on nim raul a few things i mean as you know the hbap book is relatively shortdated so we did see a material contraction in hibor i think it was down over basis points quarteronquarter and as a result that translates very quickly within quarter into the net interest margin as we look out ive been here for seven or eight hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 quarters now trying to predict the path of hibor has always been difficult but we do think that weve seen for the time being a bottoming and its been a bit higher so far in october again that will translate to a stabilization i think in hong kong and possibly a recovery but if we translate all of that into an outlook for on an aggregate level i think were broadly as we sit today comfortable with where consensus is or a range around consensus raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay with respect to wealth management in asia we started our journey on there of more rapid expansion actually before we announced the results in february or the update in february weve been growing our market share in insurance in hong kong throughout and have continued that journey in and intend to continue to invest in that business and were seeing very good results from that activity weve reclaimed a lot of market share on our insurance business in hong kong and well continue to invest in that business were looking to expand our insurance proposition beyond hong kong into other markets singapore india and in china with respect to the broader wealth agenda we again started a program of expansion of our private banking in asia increasing the number of relationship managers we have on the ground the product capability in hong kong we want to take that further across into south asia and into china and then more recently weve talked about the investment weve made in pinnacle which is a wealth management platform in china which is a combination of around about an extra to salespeople based in china serving the wealth management needs of the china population we expect to put those people on the ground over the next two to three years but were also building a technology platform to provide those salespeople with a product capability to serve the market as well so we see that as an area of growth and further investment it will be protect hong kong and continue to take market share in hong kong penetrate into china and expand across the south asia raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc given the amount of capital youve built would you consider inorganic opportunities as well in this area noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think we always look at both organic and inorganic you should always base a strategy on an organic plan first which is what were doing but were openminded as to where the right opportunities for growth will come raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 operator thank you we will now take our next question and the question comes from martin leitgeb from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international yes good morning ewen good morning noel my first question is in terms of how should we think about capital progression from here so obviously the very strong brand in terms of a or excluding transitional impacts and to your comments on dividend dividend being conservative from here does that mean that over the near to medium term we should expect hsbc to run over and above the to threshold or do you see opportunities in the way either to deploy more for growth or deploy more for returns as i think when the economic outlook normalizes and the second question i was just wondering if you could give us a feel how broad the strategic reviews youre currently undertaking the strategy laid out back in february obviously was before the pandemic unfolded how broad a strategic review are you currently undertaking both in terms of potentially addressing lower return areas but also with regards to future areas of growth for the group thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay ill take the second question and ask ewen to cover the first ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so on capital and how we think about it martin i guess a few things firstly in terms of todays ratio just to put a couple of qualifiers around it i mean firstly in q4 as you know we would typically expect core tier ratio to fall in the fourth quarter for a couple of reasons firstly the earnings are obviously impacted in the fourth quarter by the uk bank levy by seasonally lower global markets and wealth revenues and we signaled i think as part of my comments earlier that we expect to have a higher cta charge costtoachieve restructuring cost charge in the fourth quarter relative to what we saw the run rate in the first three quarters and we also do still expect some rwa pressure coming from ratings migration albeit weve been continuously surprised this year about the degree of ratings migration which is being less than we might have anticipated we also get in our ratios some benefit from covid19 regulatory relief currently thats around basis points but i think the regulators are always going to back out of their numbers when they look at our capital ratios and think about excess that weve got and i think going into were always going to want to have a buffer for contingency given will continue to be relatively uncertain as we said today i do think that if you went back to the start of the year and you think about what were managing to in our capital base is really two things one is the degree of stress that were hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 running as a bank and we do think the restructuring plan that weve announced and the areas that its targeting is going after some of the highest risk portfolios we have in the bank so over the next few years we think the aggregate level of stress youll see from us getting reported in the annual stress testing cycle will reduce and secondly as i think youre aware weve been holding excess capital in some of our subsidiaries for example in the us and as we continue to restructure i think well be able to get more of that capital back to the group so as a result we think that we can manage the bank in the medium term to and i think we should aspire to do better than that but that aspiration i think has to be very much premised over the medium term with us making serious inroads into reducing the gross level of stress that exists in the bank im confident we can get there but i wouldnt bake it into your numbers today noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and on the second part of your question we recognize that its a the lower interest rate environment is a very material drag on revenue and that it will be a hardened road to recover that lost revenue i also fully recognize theres no one silver bullet to addressing that gap it has to be a combination of growth from new areas of investment particularly fee incomegenerating activities such as i talked about earlier wealth in asia across the board range mass affluent private banking and asset management insurance growth from our transaction banking business and the fee income generation from that in foreign exchange trade and payments and cash management and growth of our balance sheet particularly in asia where i do believe theres still growth potential over the medium term for the asset side of the book but were also going to be looking up at pricing pricing of our asset book and pricing of our fee income i think its going to be a combination of those activities coupled with a continued focus on prudent cost management with an expectation as ewen said to exceed our target of billion so it will be a combination of those things and if i think back to the gfc there was no one single solution to rebooting revenue post the gfc it was a combination of things and were going to be very much focused on those same activities this time around next question please martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs international thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of manus costello from autonomous please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning manus noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hi everybody i just wanted to ask about the balance sheet and cash your cash position has grown again this quarter youre up billion since the end of last year i just wondered what can you do to help manage that cash position to help boost the nim or offset the pressure on the nim or should we assume youre just going to run with structurally very high levels of cash in your liquidity management in the future noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc well ill give a quick instinctive reaction that manus i mean im a strong believer in a strong balance sheet and a very liquid balance sheet so i understand that at the moment that liquidity is not earning a nim but in the middle of a quite a severe economic crisis its good to have a very strong liquidity position and thats been the cornerstone of hsbc for many years and it then allows us to have the strength to continue to invest in growth of the asset side of the balance sheet as that growth reemerges in the economy and be cognizant of the fact that asia seems to become an out of the covid crisis faster than the rest of the world therefore i expect growth opportunities to reemerge in asia so although that liquidity is not earning money in its own right it has the potential to earn money for us on the asset side of the balance sheet and it gives us the comfort to continue to make investment decisions in that we have a strong balance sheet both liquidity and capital but ewen do you want to comment on ph those ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean i think manus customer behavior has been exactly what you would have expected it to be so far during the crisis which both on the retail side and the corporate side a desire to retain liquidity at the moment given all of this uncertainty that exists so over the last year weve built deposits by i think its over billion thats not a natural yearonyear growth on our deposit base and reflects very much i think customer behavior so as people get more comfortable with the trajectory out of covid19 i think youll begin to see that reverse yeah on the corporate side weve already seen relative to the first quarter when a lot of corporates drew down substantially on secured lines they had with us start to repay those lines so i think as both consumers and corporates get more confidence back youll see those cash balances start reducing manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp so its more about customers behavior rather than any treasury approach that you might take ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yes noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc correct manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 got it thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of aman rakkar from barclays please go ahead your line is open aman rakkar q analyst barclays investment bank morning gents yeah just a couple please just coming back on nii so thanks very much for that comment around consensus next year i guess just the kind of implied q4 exit level probably suggests an annualized number below billion next year so to kind of get to where the street is it looks youre going to be looking to the kind of loan growth is probably my best estimate for now given that youre probably just going to be deleveraging in the us and europe interested in what kind of growth youre targeting in terms of loan growth in asia to kind of deliver those numbers i note that bounces were reasonably robust in q3 and i guess the second is on ecl can i just check is a roundup circa billion charge the best guess of a kind of underlying ecl for you guys in q3 and if thats the case does that potentially imply a number next year thats perhaps closer to billion than the billion that consensus has in next year i mean ph does that number at a fault to you or is there just too much uncertainty for now and i yeah actually you know what ill leave it there thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay well firstly on your nii math we dont disagree with the math at an aggregate level ie we do anticipate that we sort of low to midsingle digit loan growth next year to sort of underpin the comments i made about consensus and nii for next year i would the part of your commentary that europe and the us is deleveraging i think is only partly correct i think a lot of the deleveraging that we saw happened in the second quarter there is the ongoing restructuring that were doing in the rundown of the rwa books not all of that is in lending assets and were continuing we do expect uk europe us economies to recover in and we are seeing consensus forecast for asia exjapan gdp forecast thinking sitting above for both and so we do think asia growth again will outperform western growth on ecls your consensus i think is sitting at about billion for when we previously guided on loan loss provisioning precovid through the cycle we talked about to basis points at basis points top end of that you get to just over billion that feels to me intuitively as we look at a bit low at the moment equally billion feels a bit high so its sort of somewhere between those two numbers but there was still significant uncertainty out there around and i would also caveat my comments on ecls generally around brexit i think our comments about towards the lower end of the billion to billion range are very much premised on a trade agreement happening and if a trade agreement didnt happen then i think we would have to adjust up our ecl estimates you could easily see billion to billion of additional ecls in the fourth quarter if in the next few weeks we didnt have a trade agreement aman rakkar q analyst barclays investment bank perfect thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of jason napier ubs please go ahead your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch good morning thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi jason jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch for taking my questions hi there so the first one on loan losses im afraid again the performance of your loan book has been quite frankly stellar if you look at the stage data with only of retail loans in stage even a little over in stage i wondered did you have any steps that you might be able to share on the extent of any distortion in that that your customers are seeing as a consequence of the support thats around furlough schemes and moratoria and so on or is that really just conversational in nature and really that your book is this strong at this stage of the downturn and then the second question and i appreciate this is an extraordinarily sensitive area the hong kong autonomy act i wondered whether you could share what it is in your view that hsbc needs to do to avoid sanction under that act that it appears that theres some leeway around significant transactions as regards to the sanctioned individuals what do you see as your responsibilities on that act please thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay jason thank you ill add a couple of comments on the quality of the loan book and hand to ewen if he wants to add some comments and then ill pick up on the hong kong autonomy act but firstly the first thing about the nature of the book is inherently particularly in our consumer banking business we have a highquality secured book at the heart of what we do so were primarily a secured book rather than an unsecured clearly we do some unsecured lending but from proportionately we have a much higher percentage of secured lending for example here in the uk than the rest of the market and thats why i think you see a particularly strong performance in our retail book relative to other banks that would also be true in hong kong what weve also seen some of the government schemes have unwound and payment holidays have unwound we are seeing a better performance on that unwind of government schemes than we had previously modeled or expected and people are reverting to normal payment patterns at a higher percentage than we had originally modeled so theyre just some general comments ewen anything else ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i might just add a couple more things on that in terms of some weve obviously got a global portfolio of government support schemes and i think as weve seen some of them roll off particularly on the retail side our experience so far jason has been i would describe it as marginally better than what we had modeled so there has been sort of encouraging signs that the credit assumptions that weve got are holding up and secondly i think that government support that weve seen i think for the corporate sector has bought time for the corporate sector to restructure it bought time for the corporate sector to go out and raise debt and equity so sitting here six months ago we were far more concerned about downside tail risk than we would be today in hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 part because the government support has just allowed people time to restructure their businesses and be better prepared noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and on your second point jason were confident in our ability to navigate the increase in the complex regulatory environment and that were committed to complying with the laws and regulations in every market we operate in we fully acknowledge that there is a level of complexity there today given the geopolitics but were confident of our ability to navigate that situation and i think thats what id say to you in regards to the second part of the question jason napier q analyst ubs ag london branch thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of edward firth abw sic kbw please go ahead your line is open edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning everybody ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning edward edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just two questions again apologies so its back to net interest income but i was sort of more interested really in the sort of longer term outlook for net interest income rather than like this year next year and i guess therere two questions i had one if i look back to sensitivities you provided us in the past that sort of broadly if you look out five years its about double the oneyear impact is that still the way we should think about it or are there things that you can do or have done that can effectively mitigate that so that the bulk of any interest rate impact we should see is sort of plus or minus basis points broadly in there so that would be my first question and then the second question is related to that one of the big advantages of hsbc probably for the last years has been on your loans to deposit ratio of around and i guess its a bit lower now but it has been a bit hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 higher but thats broadly where you stuck it and i guess in this environment that means what of your deposits are either making you no money or actually lossmaking is there anything that you think that over a two three fouryear plan that you can do to address that or is that something that i mean could we see that moving up to that sort of level or is your preference to remain liquid likely to keep that roughly where it is sorry that was a long question noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc let me take the second part the ad ratio yes at the moment is showing a significant surplus at different points in the economic cycle that moves around and if you were to go back a couple of years you started to see quite significant loan growth with slightly slower deposit growth so you started to see the ad ratio narrow to a degree as ewen said earlier weve had an influx of deposits as customers have borrowed less spent less and accumulated cash so you could expect over time that ad ratio to change but i think weve always as a bank had a history of having a strong liquidity position so i dont see us really operating at a ad ratio in the future even in great times because we operate in markets around the world that are inherently more volatile and therefore we believe strongly in having a strong liquidity position to manage through that volatility in difficult times so you get some movement in the ad ratio going forward but i dont think youre going to get us operating at a level of on a consistent basis or any point given the inherent nature of our book of business edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so its ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah ed i think your first question i think was around the nii sensitivity tables five years out they do assume a static balance sheet they do assume no management action so i think you should assume that over a five year period we would have some capacity to mitigate some of the risks that you see in net interest rate sensitivity table noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and just going back to that point on ed if you were going to say but it depends how you look at that surplus and is it earning money or not you remember that high liquidity or low ad ratio is giving you access to an inherently higher return market in asia and the middle east so you dont necessarily deploy all the liquidity to get every last ounce of earnings out of it but having that liquidity there allows you to access an inherently higherreturn market asia and middle east the emerging markets that gives you a higher level of compensation for the amount of lending that youre doing so you earn it in a different way than full deployment into low volatility low return markets youre getting the earnings in a different way from hsbc edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so its not like i said a strategic priority for you to find assets to try and bulk up that balance sheet hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc id rather find growth good sustainable revenue growth rather than just buying books of assets for the sake of buying books of assets to use up liquidity sustainable revenue growth is what were motivated to do ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc you would know that years ago we tried something like that and it didnt work out so well so edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just wanted to see if you wanted to do the same again noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc no edward firth q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks very much operator thank you we will now take the next question from tom rayner from numis please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd hi there good morning just wanted to ask back to the broad strategic questions really and you might sort of pick me on and say wait until the full year but in terms of what youve said today on the restructuring plan youre flagging additional cost savings youre flagging additional rwa reduction im just trying to think in terms of the potential impact that that might have on future revenue growth and how important it is for you to be seen for hsbc to be seen as still having sort of growth potential almost still being a bank thats in highgrowth markets you want the market to view you as a potential growth stock how does that sit with a focus on continuing to look for the more cost savings and more rwa reductions and obviously that comment alluding to household international is quite interesting but obviously you get too desperate for growth and you buy a bad asset thats a disaster so that was my first question and then the second sort of strategic issue again from what youre saying is all of the investment is being pivoted now by the sound of it towards asia if this continues i mean is there a risk at some point the whole question of domicile and where it makes most sense for hsbc to be domiciled is that going to reemerge or is that something thats been talked about discussed and decided on and were not going to be back there any time soon thanks hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah let me couple of comments on that let me first of all say i dont think pursuing a more efficient organization necessarily means you cannot produce growth or pursue growth i think the cost reduction were going for are good sensible cost reduction ambitions reducing bureaucracy simplifying processes increasing automation improving customer experience all of those things are supportive of our growth agenda as well and what weve clearly said in the statement that we are going to continue to invest in technology to further digitize the bank and out of that digitization will come a lower cost base a better customer experience and growth opportunities as you tap more market opportunities so i dont think theyre incompatible and certainly we dont want to be a growthonly transformation story we must also be a growth story and particularly with the footprint that we have as an asian bank and an international asian bank that would be part of our agenda and on domicile weve said on many occasions were not revisiting the domicile decision we believe theres a power in being a global international bank with a strong focus on asia a strong focus on the middle east a strong business in the uk were an international bank bridging east and west and were not revisiting the domicile decision ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah now on sort of going further on rwa reduction tom i mean you can see in the dispersion of returns in our data pack that weve got a lot of capital thats not earning appropriate returns earning well below cost of capital returns and i think you and everyone else on the call should welcome the fact that were trying to accelerate that and take more of those assets off our balance sheet get more capital back as a result of that and if we can invest that in growth particularly in asia were happy to invest it and if we cant well find a way of returning it to shareholders tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay lovely thanks a lot operator thank you we will now take our next question from the line of guy stebbings exane bnp paribas please go ahead your line is open guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas good morning good afternoon everyone thanks for taking the questions noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning guy guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas good morning i just want to come back firstly to capital and specifically try and size some of the headwinds coming in the fourth quarter and you called out the typical seasonal impact from the levy in global markets being a bit lower plus the higher cta to come so perhaps earnings themselves might be a small headwind to capital hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 plus it looks like youre guiding to around about basis points headwind from rwa movement so just taking that into consideration cet1 position could drop maybe towards but i think you previously guided to software intangible benefit of around about basis points so is it reasonable to think you should still be some way above before any possible dividend announcement alongside fullyear results and then the second question was just on cp1420 and introduction of the mortgage store in the uk which is perhaps quite ph personal for hsbc given your lower starting riskweight density appreciate you were already expecting the risk weights to move up given some of the other regulatory changes and i think youve guided to or previously but given this further move does it change your view at all on uk mortgage book growth in the future i guess conversely it could actually incentivize you to tilt the book to higher margin higher risk business over time thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so look weve previously guided i think to rwa growth for the full year of sort of midsingle digits if you look today that would imply relatively material rwa growth in the final quarter that looks to me as i said today at the top end of the range of what we would expect and you would have to see a degree of rwa migration that is substantially higher than weve seen recently so we could well see a core tier ratio at the end of the year of above i think on your comment on uk mortgages even with those higher risk weights we still think that we make sensible economic returns on the mortgage lending we do in the uk so yes it is a the other thing i would say is that the uk is one of those businesses that in the outer years of the plan would have been impacted by outward flows so in some ways this is just an acceleration of that impact of future capital buffers we would have had to build anyway into the uk business guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas okay thanks very clear operator thank you we will take our last question from joseph dickerson from jefferies please go ahead your line is open joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi good morning just a couple of quick ones please just on the trajectory of getting down your targeted cet1 range i guess how do you think about buybacks in that context particularly in the near term given the various capital treatment of buybacks and youve done buybacks before so any thoughts there would be helpful and then as you seek to move towards more sustainable sources of noninterest income and deemphasize the spot deposit spread businesses i know youve mentioned that youre reviewing the us business that obviously the last review is already noted on this call happened when rates were higher i guess is everything on the table as regards the us business notably the retail business which has i believe off the top of my head or lower loantodeposit ratio thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 ewen will take the first part of that question on cet1 and ill pick up on the us ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc question again on cet1 was joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd just around buyback ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on buyback as youve said were certainly not adverse to doing buybacks i think you should have seen what we want to do first is reestablish the dividend set a sensible and sustainable dividend policy for and beyond and then to the extent that there is excess capital on top of that think about buybacks as part of that i would caution though that for in particular there continues to be meaningful levels of uncertainty around the economic outlook for so dont expect us to try to seek to rapidly normalize our capital structure during until we see genuine sustained and concrete recovery in the global economy and were through covid19 in a very meaningful way noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc and with respect to the us i just want to reiterate michael and the team in the us together with greg and george running global banking and markets have really made very strong progress in the first nine months of this year i reiterate rwa is well down adjusted costs down fte is down branches reduced by so theyve made great progress but theyre also very cognizant of the fact that the circumstances are more challenging today than they were in february and therefore theyre looking at ways to accelerate the road to improve returns but i wont go into any more detail on that at the moment well do that with our q4 results but im pleased with what theyve achieved so far joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay operator thank you that was our final question i will now hand back for closing remarks noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you thank you sharon and i just wanted to say thank you to all of you for dialing in today for your interest in hsbc and your questions id summarize by saying that we are making good progress on our transformation agenda we are investing in new growth opportunities particularly across asia im pleased that hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 27oct2020 we were able to produce billion of reported profits in q3 and we were able to finish the quarter with a cet1 ratio of i look forward to speaking to you again at the fullyear results in february thank you operator thank you ladies and gentlemen that concludes the call for hsbc holdings plc earnings release for you
