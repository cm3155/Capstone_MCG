management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases second quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call so well now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jennifer piepszak ms piepszak please go ahead jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator good morning everyone ill take you through the presentation which as always is available on our website and we ask that you please refer to the disclaimer at the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of and record revenue of billion with a return on tangible common equity of included in these results are a number of significant items first a credit reserve build of billion and then approximately million of gains in our bridge book and million of gains in credit adjustments and other both of which represent reversals of some of the losses we took in the first quarter as we continue to navigate this challenging and uncertain environment this quarters performance once again demonstrates the benefits of the diversification and scale of our platform so ill just touch on a few highlights here cib reported its highest quarterly revenue on record with ib fees up and markets revenue up yearon year each representing record performances with strength across the board we saw record consumer deposit growth of up over billion yearonyear and firmwide average deposits were trillion up yearonyear and quarteronquarter average loans were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter largely reflecting the covidrelated loan growth that we saw in march however on an endofperiod basis loans were down quarteronquarter due to revolver paydowns as well as lower balances in card and home lending partially offset by the impact of billion of ppp loans and lastly we increased our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter after building approximately billion of reserves and paying nearly billion of common dividends as youll recall we started the second quarter on the back of unprecedented levels of business activity in march on the following pages ill give you an update on some of those key activity metrics we looked at last quarter and share what were seeing today so with that lets turn to page starting with wholesale on the top of the page we saw record levels of debt and equity issuance in the quarter as clients sought to pay down the majority of the revolver draws from march and continued to shore up liquidity while market conditions were receptive supported by extraordinary central bank actions the surge in investmentgrade debt issuance seen in march continued throughout the second quarter and as highyield markets reopened us issuance volumes increased by compared to the first quarter in ecm as markets rebounded to precovid jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 levels may and june together were our two busiest months for equity issuance ever driven by converts and followons moving to consumer spending behavior on the bottom left debit and credit sales volume while overall still down has consistently trended upwards since the trough in the second week of april to down just yearonyear in the last two weeks of june te and restaurant spend continued to be down meaningfully but we have seen some improvement especially on the back of higher levels of restaurant spend the most significant improvement we saw was in retail with a strong recovery in card present volume in the second half of the quarter and consistently strong growth in card not present volume throughout the quarter more recently weve seen the improvement in overall sales growth across the country flatten out notably in both states with increasing cases and states with decreasing cases we continue to see larger yearonyear declines in states that remain partially closed particularly those in the northeast and midatlantic regions in terms of consumers demand for credit we observed similar recovery trends in auto april saw the lowest level of loan and lease originations since the financial crisis but activity rebounded sharply in may and june and in fact june ended up the best month for auto originations in our history and in home lending retail purchase applications after reaching a low in april recovered to well above precovid levels in june due to a strong and broad market recovery continuing on the topic of consumer behavior lets turn to page for an update on what were seeing around our customer assistance programs relative to the peaklevels we observed at the beginning of april weve seen a significant decline in new requests for assistance over the quarter to date we have provided customer assistance for nearly million accounts representing billion of balances across both our owned and serviced portfolios and of those accounts a large percentage having made at least one payment while in the forbearance period just over in both card and home lending in terms of early reenrollment trends in card only a small portion of our customers have completed both the initial 90day deferral period and reached a payment date but the majority of those customers resumed payments with less than of accounts requesting additional assistance and then in home lending of those whose forbearance period expired in june most have either been extended at the customers request or autoenrolled into new threemonth forbearances with approximately of the extensions still current and so while were following this data closely its still too early to draw any conclusions now moving on to page for some more detail about our second quarter results we recorded revenue of billion which was up billion or yearonyear while net interest income was down approximately million or on lower rates mostly offset by higher markets nii and balance sheet growth noninterest revenue was up billion or predominantly driven by cib markets and ib fees expenses of billion were up approximately million or yearonyear on revenuerelated expenses partially offset by continued reduction in structural expenses this quarter credit costs were billion including a net reserve build of billion and net chargeoffs of billion lets turn to page for more detail on the reserve builds our net reserve build of billion for the quarter consists of billion in wholesale and billion in consumer predominantly card the reserve increase in the first quarter was predicated on an acute but shortlived downturn with a solid recovery in the second half of the year and while we have seen some positive momentum in the economy over recent weeks there does continue to be significant uncertainty around the path of the recovery jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 at the bottom of the page you can see our updated base case but remember this is just one of five scenarios we use to derive our allowance for credit losses our build is based on the weighted outcome of these scenarios and assumes a more protracted downturn with a slower gdp recovery and an unemployment rate that remains in the double digits through the first half of in addition to the obvious impact on consumer this protracted downturn is expected to have a much more broad based impact across wholesale sectors than we assumed in the first quarter given the increased uncertainty of the macroeconomic outlook how customer payment behavior will play out and the future of government stimulus and its ultimate effectiveness as it relates to both consumers and wholesale clients weve put more meaningful weight on the downside scenarios this quarter and so therefore were prepared and have reserved for something worse than the base case and given cecl covers life of loans if our assumptions are realized we wouldnt expect meaningful additional reserve builds going forward now moving to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of which is over basis points above our new scb base minimum of and just to touch on slr while our reported ratio is its worth noting that were not going to rely on temporary relief and so without that our ratio is as we said in late june unless things change meaningfully the board intends to maintain the dividend in the third quarter given the wide range of potential outcomes going forward id like to spend a few minutes on why were comfortable saying that including the value of our strong and steady earnings stream as well as how we are managing our capital through this crisis so with that lets go to page its an obvious point but its worth a reminder that since our average quarterly ppnr of over billion has been generating over basis points of new cet1 capacity per quarter even after having made meaningful investments in our businesses this powerful earnings stream allows us to grow the franchise and serve our customers and clients when they need us most and it provides us the capacity to absorb losses and quickly replenish capital in times of stress while over the last two and a half years weve paid out approximately of cumulative earnings distributing nearly billion of excess capital were now building a significant amount of capital since weve suspended our share repurchases and we believe our capital base remains strong even in more severe scenarios which you can see on page standing here today we have billion of reserves and billion of cet1 capital of which billion is excess over and above our regulatory buffers our scb translates to billion of capital that is available to prefund stress at any time and on top of that our gsib surcharge translates to another billion all that so our billion regulatory minimum is never touched and as you know we prepare for and manage our capital to a number of scenarios and one of them is the extremely adverse scenario that jamie discussed in his shareholder letter earlier this year weve updated this analysis and it now assumes an even deeper contraction of gdp down nearly at the end of versus and reported unemployment ending the year at nearly even under this scenario we estimate that we would end the year with a cet1 ratio above and we would be bound by advanced so our regulatory minimum would be jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 while we are not likely to voluntarily dip into any of our regulatory buffers this scenario would require us to do so but notably only to a small extent its also worth noting that based on the limited information provided from the fed about their u and w scenarios we believe that our extremely adverse scenario simulates an even worse path for the economy over the next months and even if we get this wrong and our losses are twice as high we still wouldnt use the entire scb jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay yeah this is jamie id just like to amplify a couple of these points so were showing this example obviously its predicating a lot of assumptions which were not going to give you a lot of detail on just simply to show that we can bear another billion of loan loss reserves that billion brings us to an extreme adverse which roughly may equate to the u or w of the fed and were going to do a lot more analysis on that because obviously we need to be prepared for that we dip into advanced cet1 thats because were taking no actions so ive always told you that advanced capital is very procyclical so as things get downgraded your rwa goes way up your capital base doesnt change that much but the rwa goes way up and thered be lots of actions we would take that we can avoid that from taking place whatsoever the other thing i want to point out is this extreme adverse probably cant happen in one quarter itll happen in several quarters because we already know kind of what july looks like and august and stuff like that so even if the economy starts to head there itll take us a couple quarters before you make the determination that that has possibility because remember this is saying we now believe its and of course things can be worse by the way but were just trying to show you how much capital the company does have and the dividend now im going to be it sounds like im going to contradict myself i am not okay today we have all that ppnr all that earnings all the things so it would kind of be foolish to guess the future of extreme adverse and cut your dividend because we can easily get through very very tough times and never cut the dividend however if you enter something like the extreme adverse all of a sudden you have new scenarios which are even worse you dont know so at one point the board would consider cutting the dividend because things could get even worse in extreme adverse and we want to be able to handle anything out there the primary concern of the company is to serve our clients serve our community through thick or thin and no one should ever worry about jpmorgan chase so theres no intent to do it but if things get really bad and we use the word materially and significantly then thats something we should look at the other thing by the way is these loan losses are our best estimate of loan losses and not the ccar type of stuff you all are doing estimates that show dfast and fed adverse we will not lose that kind of money on credit okay and on the next page jenns going to explain some stuff and ill make a few slight additional comments i also want you to she said that were not going to use temporary buffers i think temporary is a funny thing if you go into a crisis and you can use it for a while but it disappears on march or february so in my view is we shouldnt rely on anything like that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and ill just add jamie to the point on advanced rwa if you look on the slide and you can see we traveled from to about half of that is just the rwa increasing and the other half is the losses increasing so anyway as jamie said moving on to page all of this is against the backdrop of a capital framework that still has opportunity for recalibration so while weve talked about this for years it has perhaps never been more important ill start with ccar and jamie just made this point but it is not predictive of what we actually think would happen and the best example of this might be the global market shock it is a significant portion of the scb and weve obviously experienced a very different result here in the first half of so we continue to believe that there are opportunities to rationalize the overall capital framework including the points weve repeatedly made about gsib these changes would foster a higher pace of economic growth over time without compromising financial stability jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so again i just want to emphasize a couple things here so look the point of ccar was that banks couldnt handle extreme stress and if everything goes wrong ccar itself is not a predictive forecast of what your results might be so all the ccar tests roughly equate to a global financial crisis and all the ccar tests always have us losing somewhere between billion and billion over the ensuing nine quarters but in the ensuing nine quarters after lehman we made billion we never lost money in a quarter we take action were diversified we got a lot of streams of earnings and so were not against ccar because thats protecting you from the worst of the worst of the worst but thats not necessarily predictive the global market shock which i think they have as billion in counterparty losses again just to be instructive of that in and you had fannie mae go bankrupt freddie mac go bankrupt you had bear stearns effectively you had lehman brothers effectively you had aig effectively you had tons of financial institutions in europe tons of counterparty failures and our trading results in the worst two quarters combined was a loss of billion not billion and of course it was quickly made back because as we pointed out when things get bad in trading spreads gap out and then all of a sudden youre making more money trading because you have recoveries in position so the stress capital buffer is not indicative of what we would lose and i hope over time we could drive that down by taking real actions to a number closer to gsib itself ive pointed out before im not against the concept of big banks and more capital but gsib is its not the same as ccar ccar includes your diversification your strength your earnings your ppnr and things like that gsib does not its just a measure of size multiplied over and over and over it doesnt include diversification it doesnt include margin it doesnt include actions it doesnt include its just really not representative at all what i would say is risk of a company or something like that and so we have enough capital to handle a lot of stuff which is weve always run the company that way weve always run the company so that we can handle adverse times because in my short lifetime ive seen crises over and over and over and over were not predicting them were just prepared for them so ill stop there jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay thank you all right so lets go on to the businesses so well start on page with consumer community banking so ccb reported a net loss of million including reserve builds of billion revenue of billion was down yearonyear driven by deposit margin compression lower transaction activity and customer relief partially offset by strong deposit growth and home lending margin expansion the deposit margin was down basis points yearonyear on a sharp decline in rates but deposit growth was a record yearonyear up over billion we would estimate that approximately of that growth is covidrelated due to government stimulus for consumers and small businesses lower consumer spending and tax payment delays mobile users were up yearonyear and since the start of the pandemic weve seen increased levels of digital engagement for example quick deposit enrollment is up two times precovid levels as i noted earlier for consumer lending the overall activity for the quarter reflected an environment that continued to evolve auto loan and lease originations were down yearonyear due to the exit of the mazda partnership excluding this impact auto originations were up midsingle digits and while the home lending market was favorable home lending total originations were down yearonyear driven by a decline in correspondent volume substantially offset by an increase in retail volume total ccb loans were down yearonyear driven by home lending down due to prior loan sales and card down on lower spend offset by business banking up due to ppp originations expenses of billion were down driven by lower travelrelated benefits structural and marketing expenses and lastly credit costs included the billion reserve build i mentioned earlier and net chargeoffs of billion driven by card now turning to the corporate investment banking on page cib reported net income of billion and an roe of on revenue of billion investment banking revenue of billion was up yearonyear largely driven by our strong performance in capital markets as well as the gains on our bridge book which were primarily a function of improved market conditions ib fees for the quarter were an alltime record up year onyear we maintained our number one rank and grew our market share to for the first half of the year in advisory we were up driven by the closing of a few notable transactions debt underwriting fees were up and maintained our number one rank in overall wallet and were the leaders in leadleft across leveraged finance in equity underwriting fees were up and we grew share by approximately basis points relative to the first quarter with regards to outlook we expect third quarter ib fees to be down both sequentially and yearonyear due to the usual seasonal declines and lower ma announcements yeartodate and if the economy begins to stabilize we expect capital markets to revert to normal levels however any sustained period of instability could result in additional demand for liquidity and therefore increased capital markets activity moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear an alltime record driven by strong performance throughout the quarter and it was only later in june that activity began to revert to more normal levels we saw strength across products and regions from both slow trading and large episodic transactions while strong client activity was a continuation of the first quarter theme our marketmaking activity this quarter benefited from improved market liquidity and we were able to better monetize flows fixed income was up yearonyear or adjusted for the gain from the ipo of tradeweb last year driven by very active primary and secondary markets across products particularly in macro equities was up largely jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 driven by strong client activity in equity derivatives and cash looking forward we expect the slowdown that we started to see towards the end of june to continue in addition the second half of last year was very strong making any yearonyear comparison difficult but obviously the environment makes forecasting markets performance even more challenging than usual wholesale payments revenue of billion was down yearonyear primarily driven by our reporting reclassification in merchant services security services revenue of billion was up yearonyear as continued elevated volatility in the second quarter drove increased transaction volumes and higher average deposit balances credit adjustments and other was a gain of million as i mentioned upfront driven by the tightening of funding spreads on derivatives and was a partial reversal of the losses in the first quarter expenses of billion were up compared to the prior year due to revenuerelated expenses finally credit costs of billion reflect the net reserve build i referred to earlier so now moving on to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported a net loss of million which included reserve builds of approximately billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposits and loans an equity investment gain and higher investment banking revenue largely offset by lower deposit nii record gross investment banking revenues of million were up yearonyear due to increased bond and equity underwriting activity expenses of million were down yearonyear driven by lower structural expenses deposits of billion were up yearonyear as the increase in balances from march have largely remained on our balance sheet as clients look to remain liquid in this environment endofperiod loans were up yearonyear but down quarteronquarter ci loans were down quarteronquarter as revolver utilization while still elevated has declined significantly from the alltime highs in march however this was partially offset by the impact of ppp loans cre loans were flat with generally lower originations in both commercial term lending and real estate banking credit costs of billion included the reserve build mentioned earlier and million of net chargeoffs roughly half of which were in oil and gas now on to asset wealth management on page asset wealth management reported net income of million with pretax margin and roe of revenue of billion for the quarter was up yearonyear as growth in average deposit and loan balances along with higher brokerage activity were largely offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were down yearonyear with lower structural as well as volume and revenuerelated expenses partially offset by continued investments in advisors credit costs were million driven by the reserve builds that i mentioned earlier for the quarter net longterm inflows were billion positive across all channels and all regions led by fixed income and equity at the same time we saw net liquidity inflows of billion making us the number one institutional money manager globally aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion up and yearonyear respectively were driven by cumulative net inflows into liquidity and longterm products and finally deposits were up yearonyear on growth in interestbearing products and loans were up with strength in both wholesale and mortgage lending now on to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was a loss of million down billion yearonyear driven by lower net interest income on lower rates including the impact of faster prepays on mortgage securities and expenses of million were down million yearonyear now lets turn to page for the outlook youll see here that despite the uncertain environment our latest full year outlook remains largely in line with our previous guidance based on the latest implieds we expect net interest income to be approximately billion and adjusted expenses to be approximately billion which is jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 slightly higher than expected previously reflecting the outperformance in the second quarter and will ultimately be an outcome of our performance in the second half of the year so to wrap up against the backdrop of an unprecedented environment our second quarter performance highlighted the benefit of our diversification and scale and the resulting earnings power of our company while the range of outcomes is broader than ever before our priorities remain unchanged we are focused on supporting our employees customers clients and communities around the globe and on being good stewards of the capital entrusted to us by our shareholders id like to end by thanking all of those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this crisis and our people here at jpmorgan chase who have demonstrated unwavering fortitude and dedication through these times and with that operator please open the line for qa question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions our first question comes from john mcdonald of autonomous john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning jenn and jamie jenn was wondering if you could give us some incremental color on your commercial exposures to heavily covidimpacted sectors across cre and ci so thinking oil and gas travel and retail just to help us understand the types of areas where your incremental commercial reserve building was directed towards this quarter jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so ill start by saying the most impacted sectors like the ones that you mentioned represents about a third of our overall exposure more than half of that is investment grade and twothirds of the noninvestment grade is secured and in terms of the second quarter downgrades well first id say in the first quarter when we were really looking at a deep but shortlived downturn we were really very much focused on the most impacted sectors and now that were looking at a more protracted downturn were reserved for a much more broadbased impact across sectors so just to put that in context the second quarter reserve build about of that is in the most impacted sectors versus twothirds of the build in the first quarter was the most impacted sectors and then in terms of the downgrades that we saw in the second quarter less than a third of those were in the most impacted sectors john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research and just for your definition of most impacted sectors what would you be including in that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co consumer and retail oil and gas real estate retail and lodging its sub sectors as you think about real estate jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and just a quick followup question you maintain the nii outlook for the year despite a pretty big drop in net interest margin can you talk about the dynamics embedded in that second half outlook for nii and maybe how trading nii might play into that thinking jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a great question and youre spoton which is markets helps nii so the outperformance in markets helps nii but can be a headwind on nim just given that the nim is below the average so yes maintaining that outlook did have something to do with the outperformance in markets youre right operator our next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks jennifer just to kick off on a question on page you went through a lot of detail around the forbearance that youve been giving and the percentage that has been paying you at least once during the deferral period could you give us a sense on these different asset classes that youve outlined in your base case what are you assuming those delinquencies end up becoming jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so i wont go into specific details but ill just say a couple things which is it is still too early to really read a whole lot into what were seeing the visibility here remains low i would say given the amount of support that is out there but you are right that we are considering these customers to be higher risk given that they are in forbearance programs so we did account for that as we thought about our reserves betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay because im thinking all right youve got the inverse of the righthand column could be construed as what should be expected to become delinquencies over time and im wondering as a followup question you mention during the prepared remarks that if your assumptions are realized that you could be basically close to fully reserved for this cycle maybe if you could give us a sense as to which assumptions youre talking about because i know youre expecting an outcome thats worse than your base case so i was just a little confused about what i should assume your base case is and what assumptions youre pointing to that if realized youre done on the reserving jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so first of all there are a lot of assumptions given as i said the visibility is still quite low so assumptions around the economic outlook and ill come back to that assumptions around consumer payment behavior and then assumptions around stimulus so going back to the economic outlook we have five different scenarios we did lean in more heavily to the downside scenarios relative than to what we would have otherwise done even the fed has put equal weight on downside scenarios and their base case so we certainly thought having a conservative bias there was the prudent thing to do jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 and so as you look at that slide that is just the base case so you can see there exiting this year just under when you then look at the weighted outcome of unemployment across the five scenarios we end up with doubledigit unemployment through the first half of versus what you see on page there is just the base case which shows some improvement relative to the fourth quarter getting down to just under by the end of jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co betsy ill just clarify the base case if you took morgan stanleys estimates or mike ferolis of jpmorgan or the fed estimates for their base case that is basically the base case embedded in that are all these assumptions about stimulus and ppp and all these other things and that is the base case and were reserved more than that so therefore if the base case happens we may be overreserved i hope the base case happens jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co me too operator our next question is from jim mitchell of seaport james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a quick followup on the consumer and delinquencies obviously you had an impact from deferral programs and delinquencies actually 30day delinquencies were actually down can you talk to what youre seeing in the nondeferral programs it doesnt seem like were seeing much stress at all even in the earlystage delinquencies what would you attribute that to and what are you seeing in your nondeferral programs jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i mean simply i would attribute it to the amount of support that is out there in the form of stimulus and so as i said the visibility on what were dealing with is very very low because were not seeing right now what you would typically expect to see given a recession and so the way we have to think about reserving is all about the outlook because were not actually seeing it today and so jamie has said this many times may and june will prove to be the easy months in terms of this recovery and now were really hitting the moment of truth i think in the months ahead jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah can i just amplify it in a normal recession unemployment goes up delinquencies go up charges go up home prices go down none of thats true here james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc right jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co income goes down savings go down savings are up incomes are up home prices are up so you will see the effect of this recession youre just not going to see it right away because of all the stimulus and the fact to of the unemployed are making more money than they were making when they were working so its just very peculiar times and james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah no thats fair maybe a followup on dfast jamie you made comments about the market shock we kind of went through a market shock and everyones trading held up quite well do you see that changing the feds view over time in terms of how they think about stress losses in the trading book or you dont think thats too optimistic jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i dont expect any change and like i said theyre not what theyre looking at is theyre making sure a bank can withstand the bad as if they are the worst bank theyre not giving credit to banks for things have been good so im not against that concept i just want to say if it goes really bad and you do everything totally wrong what happens to your trading for something like that and they do the same assumptions like outflows the outflows they have on liquidity are worse than the outflows of the worst bank in the worst crisis but they just want to make sure that every bank can withstand that operator our next question is from brian kleinhanzl of kbw brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks quick question on the balance sheet i mean obviously theres tremendous balance sheet growth as liquidity built up in the quarter but how are we thinking about that on a goforward basis is that expected to roll off over the next couple quarters does that kind of persist and expected to stick around and youre just going to be operating with a much larger balance sheet near term jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so ill start with deposits i mean in the first quarter it was very much a wholesale story and we said we expect it to normalize and we have seen that we started to see that so looking ahead on wholesale i think there are puts and takes well continue to see revolvers pay down securities services will likely continue to normalize i think tailwinds for deposits fed balance sheet extension will be slower but will continue and we do think well continue to see organic growth on the consumer side probably down from here on tax payments as well as a pickup in consumer spending but in both cases i think well continue to see very very strong yearonyear growth both for wholesale and consumer in the latter part of this year and then in terms of balance sheet management we manage the balance sheet across multiple dimensions nii liquidity capital and interest rate risk and so we have had billion of deposit growth since the end of last year and when you consider as you note that some of that growth is likely to be transitory and deployment opportunities have been diminished given the rate environment we have held a decent amount of that in cash jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 however we did add about billion in securities here in the second quarter and on the deposit side weve been very disciplined on pay rates brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so because deposits have grown we should expect more to migrate from deposits on the asset side into securities or are you looking to fund loans on those jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co as the fed grows the balance sheet its going to end up in deposits and for the most part a lot of deposits will end up in securities because the loan growth usually going into a recession doesnt go up that much jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah we should see as consumer spending recovers we should see some growth in card which will help but well have ppp starting to pay down and as jamie said loan growth but likely slower jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co id actually just point out that if you look at the big numbers we have over trillion between cash held at the central bank which is close to billion billion treasuries which is close to several hundred billion and other very liquid assets mostly good securities thats trillion when people look at the safety and soundness of an institution like this that is a tremendous sum of money some is required we are required to hold a lot of liquidity but some of its just because were investing considerably brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks operator our next question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning i was just wondering if you could talk a bit about the expected timing of starting to see some chargeoffs obviously theres a lot of unknowns with the stimulus and the forbearance but what are your assumptions in terms of when chargeoffs start going up maybe where they peak and how long they stay at that level jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co its really difficult to know i mean first we have to start seeing delinquencies and so later this year but next year will be much heavier on chargeoffs as we think about realizing the assumptions that weve made in the reserve its very its difficult to know the good thing is cecl is life of loan so we feel wellcovered for the scenarios that were looking at jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then remind us you are seeing some creep in the nonperforming assets obviously its off low levels but they are starting to go up and remind us why thats not starting to feed into net chargeoffs or is this just a timing issue and will in the next quarter or two jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah when you look at the nonaccrual increase in wholesale half of that is one client so its really i wouldnt draw any conclusions from that and as you say its creeping up off of very low levels so again we still arent seeing what you would expect to see in terms of recessionary indicators operator our next question is from mike mayo of wells fargo mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just more on the reserve question so if the feds base case is achieved then you are overreserved if your base case assumptions which are more jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we hope we hope we hope mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we hope were overreserved regardless mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and if your base case assumptions which are more conservative are realized then okay youre done with the reserve building and if its worse then youll have to add more reserves jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc but since the end of the quarter were seeing an increase in covid cases in florida in texas in california and elsewhere and isnt there a link between an increase in covid cases with deaths with economic activity or how do you think about that and im staring at slide and i cant get my eyes off that debit and credit card sales jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 volume and it seems like its flattening off here in june so just since the end of the quarter if you were to kind of marktomarket your thinking as of this second with whats happening do you feel better worse or the same versus the end of the quarter as it relates to your assumptions jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we feel exactly the same today than we did at the end of the quarter thats the marktomarket and mike were very clear we cannot forecast the future we dont know were also very clear that i know at least i think youre going to have a much murkier economic environment going forward than you had in may and june and you have to be prepared for that youre going to have a lot of ins and outs you have people thats scared about covid theyre going to be scared about the economy small businesses their companies bankruptcies emerging markets so it is just going to be murky which is why if you look at the base case an adverse case an extremely adverse case theyre all possible and were just guessing at the probabilities of those things thats all what were doing we are prepared for the worst case we simply dont know i dont think anyone knows the word unprecedented is rarely used properly this time its being used properly its unprecedented whats going on around the world and obviously covid itself is a main attribute so the feds w case they made it very clear their w case is that covid comes back in a big way in the fall and you have to shut down the economy again and obviously we got to be prepared for that too we dont know the probability of that we simply dont know and by the way were wasting time guessing jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and i would just add mike to clarify that we are reserved for something worse than the base case jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co right jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and for all the reasons you said they informed our decision to lean in a bit more on the downside scenarios and so while there is a bit of we hope a conservative bias here this does represent our best estimate based upon everything we know which does include the sort of slowdown that you referenced in terms of more recent activity mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right and my followup would be kind of the flip side during this very difficult time youve grown deposits over the past year equal to the fifth largest bank i mean the deposit growth is kind of off the charts here so you said half of that is due to covid but is the other half due to share gains so i guess theres several questions in that but how much of that is related to digital banking and how much of that do you expect to go away once this crisis has passed jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 so i talked a little bit about kind of how were thinking about deposits looking forward also ill just clarify mike when we said covidrelated that was on the consumer side and so that we do think some of that will leave with tax payments and consumer spending coming back and then in terms of how much of it is share gains its difficult to know at this point historically we have performed well in lower rate environments and i think youre right i think it is because of our digital capabilities and our branch footprint and our people and all the things that we offer that differentiate us in a time like this operator our next question is from erika najarian from bank of america erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning this first question is for jamie a lot of investor feedback has indicated that they are encouraged by the fact that banks can remain profitable while absorbing pretty significant provisions which youve proven today but are hesitant about bank stocks given the overhang of the dfast resubmissions in the fourth quarter and what that could imply for the dividend and i know you alluded to this in your prepared remarks but im wondering under the scenario that you see playing out and relative to that basis points of cet1 generation per quarter what is your view on dividend sustainability outside of that extreme adverse case jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co its completely sustainable and if we enter the extreme adverse case the board should and will consider reducing it and like i pointed out the extreme adverse case itself is completely sustainable with the dividend the reason they would consider reducing it is because once you enter like or unemployment you dont know the future so now we have another extreme adverse case which is going to be unemployment and therefore you would protect yourself from that and cutting your dividend is cheap equity and so the goal is to sustain the dividends you can look at the numbers its completely miniscule relative quarterbyquarter so this decision can be made as you enter these things and were all hoping the base case happens soon erika najarian q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and just as a quick followup we also got this question from investors in the extreme adverse case is there a preference towards cutting the dividend or a temporary suspension or is there a difference between the two jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co theres no difference between the two you cut your dividend youre going to hopefully put it back when the time comes and temporary suspension just sounds peculiar its a suspension and ive done that twice in my life its the prudent thing to do if you might need that capital going forward because things are going to get that terrible or something like that remember the other thing you can ask the other question if the base case happens were going to end up with far too much capital generation and well start buying back stock again which i hope we can do before it goes way up operator our next question is jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 so we dont expect that this year but i wouldnt completely rule it out in the fourth quarter operator and our next question is from glenn schorr of evercore jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there question for you so we had this big market rebound in the overall markets and thats led to a lot of revenue but given this outlook and the uncertain path that weve been talking through this whole time im curious on ways you think about potentially derisking on balance sheet now some of it is just this huge liquidity buildup is a derisked balance sheet i get that but are there proactive things you can do to reduce the high leverage rwa in a more stressed environment have you been selling into this recovery is i guess my question jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co do you want jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well go ahead jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co well i was just going to say i guess theres two components to it which is the investment securities portfolio and then proactive things we could do on rwa if that answers your question glenn ill start with investment securities we are being cautious and we have opportunistically looked to reduce credit exposure there over the second quarter and then on rwa we are because were preparing for a range of outcomes we are spending a lot of time thinking about if we needed to what could we do but it is sort of a last resort because we certainly dont want to have any impact on clients and customers and so were ready were looking at it but we havent done anything i would say proactively at this point were very much focused on helping clients and customers get through this crisis jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so let me answer sorry on the consumer side we like other banks youve seen are kind of prudent and tightening up with how you do credit thats already happened and obviously you can do some more but jenn you had some great numbers about how good credit is like i think the give us the fico numbers you gave me the other day jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co the fico jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well then how much better home lending is jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co that on the ltv jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co the weighted average ltv jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ltv yeah jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i mean its really extraordinary and i was in mortgage so i shouldve remembered but i did have to ask and in our weighted average ltv on the portfolio in home lending was and its now jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co right and you can assume its better in credit cards its better in auto we have less subprime thats the consumer side on the lending on the business side weve always been prudent were always very tight and careful on stuff like that usually what happens in downturns like this you get a little more serious about security and the management team and responsiveness and raising capital so a lot of these companies have been raising a lot of capital on the investment side and this is kind of a peculiarity of accounting again we can actually make it more conservative by putting securities into heldtomaturity which weve done very little of and im going to consider it i dont personally understand why that reduces risk but it does reduce your scb and maybe well do that over time but the securities portfolio is pretty prudent as they are and then trading is every day so trading is just think of trading as if daniel and troy rohrbaugh and jason sippel and the whole team they are every single day managing those risks and those exposures and you could assume that theyre managing it very very well and tightly today and we certainly are not punting to the fences or anything like that were trying to be very cautious and serve our clients and so yeah you are more conservative and reducing rwa yes if we wanted to we could start doing that by all these various things glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 thanks one quickie on the consumer side im curious if youve had were now four months into the bulk of the lockdown in the united states and some of your branches have been either closed or driveup only and were watching your deposits grow like a weed so im curious if youve learned any lessons that might change your thoughts on the branch network on your organic growth efforts as we go forward and come out of this someday jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so first of all the deposit numbers deposits went up because of ppp deposits went up because of the payroll checks that people got deposits went up the revolvers were taken down by billion something like that jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co something like that almost all that ended up in deposits and of course a lot of thats already reversed and stuff like that so you got to look at both sides of that but you were going to say something jenn jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i was just going to add on i mean theres of course were learning a lot i mean i mentioned the quickdeposit enrollment but we havent learned enough to make any changes to our strategy around branch expansion in fact we just opened our hundredth branch in market expansion so were really excited about that we think well probably open another this year so well be nearly halfway to the branches that we talked about in market expansion and so well see we do still have about branches that are closed and its possible that we learned something that helps us think about accelerating dedensification or consolidation but itll be at the margin and were not going to make any big changes quickly because we want to make sure that we have the benefit over time of watching our customer behavior so they can really be the ones that inform our strategy operator our next question is from charles peabody of portales partners charles peabody q president portales partners llc yes good morning two questions one on page you give the slr ratio as adjusted for the temporary relief programs on the capital wonder if you had a similar ratio for cet1 and part of that question would also be which would be the more confined ratio starting next march jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co theres no temporary relief in cet1 jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co well cet1 the only and im not even trying to call it relief theres a phasein on cecl jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co oh yes jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co but its over many years and so i dont necessarily think about that as temporary like slr slr at this point it is temporary it is due to expire in the first quarter of next year which is why were very focused on managing that without the exclusions jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and theyre both we manage them both i wouldnt say one is more than the other we manage something like different capital and liquidity ratios charles peabody q president portales partners llc and jamie fsoc is meeting today behind closed doors if i understand there are two topics one has to do with mortgage secondary mortgage market liquidity and the other was the covid stress test overlay do you have any thoughts or insights as to what they may be discussing on either of those jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i dont the covid that means you could be well you obviously have some insights that i dont have the covid obviously were going to run a new stress test were going to run it were going to look at all the fed cases u w and stuff like that because they laid it out perfectly reasonable that people would prepare for that kind of stress test i think the mortgage markets is a different issue okay and weve been very consistent that mortgages believe it or not are far more costly than they should be normally youd be looking at if you looked at the 10year rate which is what basis points the mortgage today should be or instead they are the cost and the reason for that is because the cost of servicing an origination is so high its obviously got to be passed through its high because an enormous amount of rules and regulation are put in place that a lot do not create safety and soundness safety and soundness is basically ltv verify peoples incomes make sure youre doing the right kind of stuff and the second one is because theres barely no securitization market the securitization market is important because it reduces your riskweighted asset and it puts more incentive for banks to put in their balance sheet and the securitization market is a real transfer of risk to somebody else so i think they should change that they should change it immediately the beneficiary of that will be nonagency mortgages which are even more a lot more expensive than agency mortgages jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 so once you have a securitization market that people believe in and you have to change reg ab a little bit to that and all those things youre going to have a much better market the cost of mortgages will come down and theyll particularly come down for people at the lower end so this should be phased and it should be phased right away operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for taking my question i have a broader question and i just want to get your perspectives on public policy and banks and a little bit more broadly than the discussion about capital planning and stress tests and i know banks are working hard to be part of the solution this time and not part of the problem but were also having more open discussions about things like inequality and social justice which in my opinion are long overdue but i worry that fair or not banks are sort of being depicted as being on the wrong side of some of those issues and i think you see that in things like the mainstream press depictions of big banks and ppp and stuff like that and im just curious if you are concerned at all about populist antibank policies gaining traction however you want to define them whether its breaking up the banks directed lending rate caps or whatever in a pretty polarized political environment or do you think im being too alarmist or overly concerned about stuff that is pretty unlikely in our country so just kind of want to get your perspective just generally on how banks fit into the overall policy and political backdrop jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co let me get this the thing you got to do every single day when you go to work is just do the right thing for the right reasons serve your customers and we try to do that we try very hard to take care of our employees to train people we try very hard to advance black leaders in the company finance others and of course we make mistakes and so i understand some of the angst out there but we try to do the best we can we get involved in policy like this mortgage thing that would be better for americans and we understand that people want banks to help america we do the most important thing we can do is be a healthy vibrant bank through this crisis and continue to serve our clients and remember responsible lending is good lending irresponsible lending is bad lending so very often when you hear that banks should do more of that no irresponsible stuff is irresponsible it will lead to bad outcomes and thats kind of what happened last time around so we try to do it right and we try to listen very carefully when theres criticism and sometimes and often legitimate about what we could have done better or should do better or try to do better in the future saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay thats helpful i guess as broad as that question was im going to ask a very narrow question for jenn on your nii guidance i presume that includes gains on ppp fees for unforgiven loans and have you quantified that or sized that up in terms of where you think the magnitude of those figures could be jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 so weve been really clear on ppp which is that we dont intend to profit from ppp that doesnt mean that you wont have some geography issues so youll have some revenue and then youll have expenses and the profit will be near zero it is an immaterial amount this quarter given these fees are recognized over the lives of the loans so its very little this quarter both revenue and expenses and looking out youll see well see more of that probably in the third and fourth quarter again it will still be zero on the bottom line and even the gross numbers wont be meaningful in the grand scheme of things operator our next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning jenn can you share with us the reclassification of the wholesale portfolio that you talked about how often do you go through that process where you have to look to reclassify the corporate loans and second you touched on earlier in a question about some of the covidrelated sectors that are being impacted because of what were going through can you highlight for us what is the most stressed within that covid group that you mentioned jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so first on the reclassification we mentioned it was a geography issue in merchant services it didnt have to jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co there was no reclassification of wholesale loans jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah yeah and then in terms of the most impacted they are the ones that you would expect to see around travel oil and gas and real estate and retail so its the sectors that you would expect to see although as i said earlier and its important to note that for the downgrades that we experienced in the second quarter less than a third of them were in the most impacted industries so really this is were seeing this as being much more broadbased gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you and then second i may have missed this i apologize but in your slide you give us very good detail on the forbearance on the consumer portfolio do you have any numbers on the commercial and corporate portfolios that loans that might be in forbearance and is it more commercial real estate or ci jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co theyre just not meaningful numbers we would have included them had they been so ill just go back to what we said which is were just not seeing what you would typically see jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 but they end up in nonperforming jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co they end up in nonperforming jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we dont have a category in wholesale or commercial the same way you have a category in consumer operator and our next question is from ken usdin of jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning just a question on the points and slides you made about capital and longterm opportunities for recalibration first i guess will you have any dialogue with the fed about the scb as some other banks have mentioned and then secondly where do you think we stand on the gsib recalibration to your points about systemic risks that shouldnt impact a banks balance sheet jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co were not going to just go back to the fed on the but obviously were looking at why and we can try to adjust our plans going forward to try to reduce that number a little bit because we know we have another ccar coming up in a couple months so theres no reason for us to go through extensive amounts of work as opposed to fix whats already there and gsib look ive always thought gsib needed a lot of recalibration but there are things they should have recalibrated for already because america has goldplated it which i think was wholly unnecessary they should have taken cash and treasuries and a whole bunch of stuff out of the calculation and obviously it goes way up when the fed does things like theyre doing recently and they never adjusted it for growth in the economy or growth in the shadow banking system which they were supposed to do so im just hoping they go about and do that at one point but these things get so wrapped up in political people politicize very complicated calculations which i find kind of peculiar and funny but my view is if they do the numbers they should do them right and theyre just not right anymore ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes and the second question is just going back to slide you lay out the percent of accounts on this page auto seems to be the biggest and then in the supplement on page the balances seem to imply a bigger percent on deferral just can you talk a little bit about the differences there and then why do you think youre seeing more accounts in auto deferring versus other asset classes thank you jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 okay i dont actually know the answer to reconciling the supplement to slide so jason and team can follow up with you on that one ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay maybe then just a comment about auto on deferrals and what do you think youre seeing in that customer base versus others and do you think that means anything different for forward credit trends jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co no yeah ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks very much operator our next question is from chris kotowski of oppenheimer chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc hi yeah good morning thank you i guess i just think it was such an extraordinary quarter for capital raising dealogic shows over trillion of debt and equity raised in the quarter and i guess a twopart question around that one is as you look at that was a good portion of that in kind of the stressed areas and presumably capital that is junior to your bank debt and to what extent has all that helped raise the quality of bank loans and then secondly looking forward did all the companies that needed to and could raise capital do so in the second quarter and therefore were looking at kind of a flat spot going forward or do you see this as kind of like theres an ongoing need for a lot of these companies to continue to raise capital jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well i think first of all it was across the board you saw strong companies weaker companies high yield markets opened up converts id put converts and equity in there too people did a lot of capital raising i think it was wise i think a lot of people said they prefunded a lot of their capital needs to make sure they can get through whatever this crisis means for their company and their industry and stuff like that so i dont think it would be like it was before so itll definitely come down but i still think theres opportunity for some people to prefund some of that but it is prefunding this is not capital a lot of this capital is not being raised to go spend its being raised to sit in the balance sheet so that youre prepared for whatever comes next and youve heard a lot of companies make statements and you guys got to go through it yourself about you know weve got two years of cash weve got three years of cash weve got people want to be prepared and i think its appropriate jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thats it for me thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but just for your models we dont expect revenues in investment banking theyll normalize or even come down below normal next quarter and the quarters out at one point and we cant predict month by month exactly and for trading because no one asked cut it in half cut it in half and thatll probably be closer to the future than if you say its going to still be double what it normally runs operator and our next question is from andrew lim of société générale jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible last question andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk hi good morning thanks for taking my questions i think theyre quite straightforward i just want some clarity really on the nature of cecl provisioning and obviously youve made some very big provisions based on much more conservative assumptions but the nature of cecl provision obviously could mean that in the third quarter if your assumptions do not change then your provisions should fall down quite considerably versus the second quarter to a much more normal level i just wanted to see how you thought about that for the third quarter jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so i would start by saying where we are right now while there is a conservative bias to where we are right now it is our best estimate of what were facing we certainly hope that in the future we look back on this as a conservative moment but this is our best estimate and so if our assumptions are realized and again our reserve reflects something worse than the base case so if thats realized then we shouldnt see meaningful reserve builds in the third quarter or if that continues to be our andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk right jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co third quarter andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk yeah so i mean context would it be similar to quarters that weve seen in for example jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2020 jennifer a piepszak a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes you have reserves for growth but not for the crisis per se andrew lim q analyst société générale sa uk exactly exactly thats very clear thanks for that and then on the cib trading environment obviously we saw june and weve seen better in july would you say thats normalized to a level consistent with what weve seen with or are you still seeing some pretty strong trading following through into the third quarter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i just answered that question you should assume its going to fall in half we dont know its only been a couple weeks into the thing but we dont assume were going to have these unbelievable trading results going forward and hopefully well do better than that but we simply dont know i also just want to point out in reserving since its probabilistic you could actually change nothing in your assumptions but the probabilities of potential outcomes wed put up more reserves operator we have no further questions at this time jennifer a piepszak chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co thank you operator thank you for participating in todays call you may now disconnect
