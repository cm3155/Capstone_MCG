strategy corporate secretary popular inc thank you paul good morning and thank you for joining the call we began the year with a strong quarter achieving net income of million our quarterly net income was million lower than the adjusted fourth quarter net income of million first quarter results were impacted by lower net interest income offset in part by lower expenses higher non interest income and a slightly lower provision for credit losses loans increased during the quarter by million banco popular generated loan growth across all segments while popular bank saw commercial loan growth offset by runoff in the construction and consumer portfolios our net interest margin decreased by basis points ph to in the quarter higher deposit costs particularly in our puerto rico public deposit portfolio and the popular bank impacted our margin this was partially offset by an improvement in asset mix due to loan growth and a reduction of the investment portfolio credit quality trends remained favorable during the period npls decreased and net chargeoffs remained wellbelow prepandemic levels during the quarter popular issued million in fiveyear senior notes with a coupon we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem or repay the million principal amount of our senior notes that matured in september please turn to slide we maintained robust liquidity anchored by our diversified deposit franchise and our high levels of cash reserves and unpledged securities our deposit franchise is made up of approximately in retail deposits with an average balance of less than per account of the balances are in public sector deposits which are secured by collateral are in commercial deposits and the remaining are wholesale deposits overall deposits were down by million in the quarter but liquidity sources were up by billion our total consolidated borrowings including our newlyissued senior notes remained flat during the quarter our customer base in puerto rico grew by approximately during the quarter reaching nearly million unique customers adoption of digital channels among our retail customers remained strong active users on our mi banco platform exceeded million or of our customer base in addition we continued to capture more than of our deposits through digital channels this trend remains significantly higher than prepandemic levels and well above our island peers in the first quarter consumer spending remained healthy and with combined credit and debit card sales of compared to the first quarter of as on the mainland mortgage originations in puerto rico have been impacted by rising rates and also by limited inventory of available properties the dollar value of mortgage originations at banco popular decreased by compared to the first quarter of last year driven by lower refinance activity due to the interest rate environment the local economy performed well during the first quarter business activity is solid and remains in good shape as reflected in the continued positive trends in total employment and other published economic data while new auto sales have slowed compared to the quarterly pace of the past couple years they remain above pre pandemic levels evidencing continued robust demand for cars in puerto rico the tourism and hospitality sector continues to be a source of strength for the local economy yeartodate san juan airport has seen record levels of passenger traffic hotel demand also has been strong as can be seen in record high average daily rates and revenues per available room popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 there are still approximately billion of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed we expect that these funds will support economic activity in many sectors in the coming years we are uniquely positioned to serve the needs of our customers and to benefit from such activity in short we are pleased with our results for the quarter particularly our solid loan growth in puerto rico and the continued strength of our deposit base liquidity and credit quality we are mindful of and have been monitoring the economic and market environment as well as the recent developments in the us banking sector we will continue to manage our banks to maintain significant available liquidity as we grow responsibly despite these headwinds we remain optimistic about the future of puerto rico our primary market and our ability to manage and serve the needs of our customers through any potential challenges that may lie ahead i now turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc thank you javier good morning sorry apologies please turn to slide net income was million compared to million in q4 excluding the impact of the million dta allowance reversal in q4 net income decreased by million from q1 net interest income was million a decrease of million from q4 million of the variance was related to the lower day count during the quarter on a taxable equivalent basis net interest income was ph million compared to million in q4 the variance was primarily a result of higher interest expense on deposits of million resulting from increased deposit rates mainly from puerto rico public deposits and to a lesser extent popular bank noninterest income was million an increase of million from q4 this include included in this result was a million litigationrelated insurance claim reimbursement the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the fourth quarter total operating expenses were million a decrease of million from the prior quarter this reduction was primarily driven by lower professional fees by million as well as lower technology and software expenses by million historically these costs tend to be lower during the first quarter of every year this is more accentuated in the first quarter of this year due to our multiyear transformation initiatives during q1 we had million transformation related expenses compared to million last quarter as the transformation progresses expenses will shift from advisory and conceptual plans to the development and execution of implementation plans as a result we expect a slower pace of expenditure initially as in q1 and then acceleration as the year progresses we continue to anticipate transformationrelated expenses of million in other large expense variances were lower seasonal business promotion expenses by million which was somewhat offset by higher personnel cost by million primarily related to the previously disclosed increase in hourly minimum wage at bppr that took effect in january and lower oreo benefit of million mostly due to lower gain on sale of properties our quarterly expense trajectory has historically ramped up as the year progresses we anticipate that will be consistent with that experience and continue to expect expenses for the year of approximately billion popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 our effective tax rate for the quarter was for the full year we expect the effective tax rate to be within the range of to higher than the range provided during our last webcast in the nearterm we expect to run our banks with a higher level of reserves at the fed which leads to less taxexempt income and therefore a higher tax rate than we have previously anticipated please turn to slide net interest income was million on a taxable equivalent basis it was million million lower than in the fourth quarter net interest margin decreased by basis points to in q1 on a taxable equivalent basis nim was a decrease of basis points the decrease is driven by higher interest expense on deposits due to a significant though anticipated basis point increase in the cost of public deposits this was partially offset by higher loan balances and yields plus an improved mix of earning assets at the end of the first quarter public deposits were roughly billion or billion excluding million in deposits held and managed by our trust division this compares to billion and billion respectively at yearend in the past we had excluded the balances in trust from our discussion about puerto rico public deposits given that these are managed by our fiduciary services division where we act as custodian or escrow agent however we have decided to aggregate these amounts to reflect the overall relationship with government entities and provide more visibility to collateralized deposits these trust deposits have always been reported in our total deposit bonds during now inclusive of trust deposits we expect public deposits to be in a range of billion to billion essentially unchanged from our previous expectations of billion to billion that excluded trust deposits its important to reiterate that by law in puerto rico public deposits must be collateralized any decrease in the level of these deposits will have no significant impact on our liquidity excluding puerto rico public deposits consolidated deposit balances increased by ph million in the quarter primarily time and saving deposits at popular bank gathered through a direct channel this compares to a decrease of billion in nonpublic deposits during the fourth quarter in q1 we continued to see some commercial and high net worth clients pursuing better yields on excess liquidity moving these funds outside the banking sector however we have been able to capture a good portion of these movements in our broker dealer which saw an increase in assets under management of approximately ph million since the end of q1 overall deposits have increased by approximately million our interest rate sensitivity continues to be relatively neutral as the year progresses we expect the margin to resume an upward trajectory the timing will depend on the interaction of our loan growth and mix deposit balances and the pace of repricing of public and incrementally nonpublic deposits our hedging loan balances increased by million compared to q4 driven by growth on all loan segments at bppr and commercial loans at pb we are encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and pb we will continue to take advantage of opportunities to extend credit thereby improving the use and yield of our existing liquidity please turn to slide ph deposit betas recurring tightening cycle are now at or above the prior cycle we have seen a total cumulative deposit beta of to date however in q1 we saw an acceleration of deposit pricing in bppr total deposit cost increased by basis points led by public sector deposits in pb total deposit cost increased by points led by retail deposits as we increased the use of our online deposit channel in puerto rico our combined retail and commercial deposit beta cycle to date have been less than as weve discussed over the past couple of quarters given the rapid shift to higher shortterm interest rates we expected a significant increase in the cost of public deposits in the first quarter the cost increased by basis points versus our january estimate of roughly basis points the difference rests in lower average balances and the mechanics of the interest expense calculation popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 we expect the cost of public deposits to increase by approximately basis points in q2 the deposit pricing agreement with the puerto rico public sector is market linked with a lag this source of funding resulted in an attractive spread on our market rates please turn to slide we have added the following two slides in our deck because of the increased focus on liquidity borrowings and deposit composition liquidity sources for the corporation increased by billion in q1 of this liquidity resides in excess funds at the fed and unpledged securities borrowings for the quarter were flat at billion we reduced our federal home loan bank borrowings by million in q1 however the issuance of our senior notes due in roughly compensated for that reduction there were no incremental borrowings during the quarter from the federal home loan bank the fed discount window or the bank term funding program on march popular issued million of senior notes due in we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of the offering to redeem or repay million principal amount of our outstanding senior notes that mature in september please turn to slide the summation of transactional accounts and time deposits with balances over ended q1 at billion or of total deposit balances the liquidity sources described in slide the prior slide totaled billion covering of deposits over the balances of our noninterest bearing deposits have been steady most of our recent balance changes have been in interest bearing accounts please turn to slide our investment portfolio is almost entirely comprised of treasury and agency mortgage backed securities which carry minimal credit risk including our cash position this portfolio has an average duration of approximately years as discussed previously during the rapid increase in rates in as well as the uncertain outlook for interest rates in october of last year we transferred to heldtomaturity billion of us treasuries thereby reducing the future impact of rates on tangible book value at the time this action reduced aoci exposure to interest rates by about a third when transferred to htm these positions had a pretax unrealized loss of million which will be amortized back into capital throughout the remaining life of the transferred positions as of the end of the first quarter the balance of this unrealized loss stood at million a reduction of million from q4 and million from the transfer date we expect this loss to be amortized back into capital through the remaining life of the portfolio at a rate of approximately per quarter through as a result of the timing of this transfer and given the level of rates at quarterend all of the unrealized losses related to the htm portfolio are already reflected in our tangible capital therefore at the end of the quarter there are no significant recognized marks related to our htm book please turn to slide our return on tangible equity was in the quarter regulatory capital levels remained strong our common equity tier ratio in q1 of increased by basis points from q4 tangible book value per share at quarterend was an increase of per share or almost from q4 this improvement is driven mostly by a favorable variance of million in the net unrealized losses on securities availableforsale and quarterly net income of million partially offset by dividends declared in the quarter finally touching on capital we will revisit future capital actions in the second half of our longterm outlook and capital return has not changed anchored in our strong regulatory capital ratios however in the nearterm we need to get more certainty on the outlook for rates and the economy and also for clarity on the potential popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 regulatory response to recent events in the banking sector over time we expect our regulatory capital ratios to gravitate towards the levels of our mainland peers plus the buffer with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continue to reflect stable credit quality trends with low levels of net chargeoffs and decreasing npls we remain encouraged by the performance of our loan book postpandemic specifically early delinquency net chargeoffs and nonperforming loan inflows continue to trend significantly below prepandemic levels turning to slide number nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter driven by an npl decrease of million due to lower mortgage and consumer npls in puerto rico ph offset in part by oreo increase of million npl inflows increased slightly quarteronquarter at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans held in portfolio decreased to from in the previous quarter turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million for an annualized basis points of average loans held in portfolio compared to million or basis points in the prior quarter the results for the quarter were impacted by a million chargeoff on a previouslyreserved loan excluding this the net chargeoff ratio would have been ph basis points please turn to slide number at the end of the first quarter the acl decreased by million to million during the quarter we implemented the new accounting guidance which eliminated accounting for ph bppr and the requirements to measure the effect of the concession from a loan modification this impact resulted in a release in the acl of approximately million driven by our mortgage tdr portfolio which is presented as an adjustment to the beginning balance of retained earnings net of tax effect excluding this impact the acl increased by ph million driven by changes in the hpi forecast higher loan volume portfolio mix and the migration of consumer credit scores the provision for credit losses was million compared to million in the prior quarter to summarize our loan portfolio continued to exhibit strong credit quality trends in the first quarter with low net chargeoffs and decreasing nonperforming loans we remain attentive to evolving environment we remain encouraged by the postpandemic performance of our loan book we believe that improvement made over time in the risk profiles of the corporations loan portfolio positions popular to operate successfully on the more difficult economic conditions before i turn the call over to javier let me comment on ph popular series of office segment exposure the office segment is receiving a lot of attention in the current environment due to the achieved level of work and higher interest rates in the case of popular our office exposure is limited representing only or million of our total loan portfolio the exposure is mainly comprised of low to midpriced property ph with original size of million and is welldiversified across payment type with that i would like to turn the call over to javier for his concluding remarks thank you popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 javier d ferrer executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates popular started off with a strong first quarter building on the positive momentum generated in our diversified business model and strong deposit base robust regulatory capital and liquidity position are a source of strength which allow us to continue to meet our clients needs as reflected by the growth in our customer base and loan portfolio during the quarter we are optimistic about the opportunities that lie ahead and we remain vigilant around potential risks stemming from continued inflation and economic and market uncertainty economic trends in puerto rico continue to be positive and a considerable amount of recovery funds yet to be disbursed are expected to support increased economic activity in future years we made progress on our transformation initiatives during the quarter which over time will drive more customer connectivity operational efficiencies and greater potential for profitable growth and sustainable return on capital i want to recognize and express our gratitude to our colleagues it is their daily effort and commitment that lead to our customers continued trust in popular and our strong results we are now ready to answer your questions question and answer section operator we will now begin the qa session operator instructions the first question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs please proceed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc good morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc i was hoping maybe carlos could we dive back into the net interest income the fte situation so you i guess im trying to understand so youre going to hold more cash at the fed with both the puerto rican sub and the us sub and so thats resulting in lower levels of taxexempt interest income but is there i guess is there some gaap nii impact there as well im just getting a few questions about it it came across a little confusing carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 no i think your description is correct brody the cash we keep at the fed earns tax or it did for the bank in puerto rico by the way mostly it does not apply affecting the states it earns taxable income as opposed to when we hold treasury securities a large extent to a large extent bank in puerto rico so our mix of taxable and nontaxable income shifts towards taxable so that results in a higher in a higher tax rate brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc and will that and will that get i guess will that strategy of holding higher levels of cash in the puerto rican sub will that get reversed once we get clarity on liquidity and the economy or is that like kind of like holding higher levels of cash through the expectations carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc well at least for the moment it is our choice and well ph revisit that choice every week in our local community well see whether it continues to be our choice once the regulators express themselves brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay so it seems like its more conservatism at this point indiscernible yes go ahead ph jorge a yes you asked a question about impacting gaap nii given that the yield on cash overnight at the fed versus shortterm rates is not very different we wouldnt expect a significant difference in gaap nii from that shift certainly our fte nii will be affected because of that strategy brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i guess what is i guess from this strategy how much on a quarterly basis is the fte impacted a that will be driven by everything everything else on our you know the deposit costs that are disallowed et cetera so thats a little bit more complicated carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes its a little bit more complicated calculation on that one and of course also depends on us continuing the strategy ph at the present level and that figure is free and outcome brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay but it is fair to say that like as deposit costs move higher if you kept the same level of cash at the fed that there would be an incremental drag on the fte nii popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc that would be fair yes brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay indiscernible and on the fee income okay okay on the fee income i just wanted to get a sense for where you thought that would shake out going forward and ill stop there and ill hop back in the queue for my other questions carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc now fee income our fee income is ph reasonable steady over a year if you divide by four but then its harder stating on a quarterbyquarter basis so it tends to fluctuate a little bit up and down were happy to have started slightly ahead of our ph guidance per quarter but for the moment we still think that guidance is applicable and well revise that again depending on the results of the second quarter well see if it is worth the change so for the moment well keep the guidance were very pleased ph that were excited ahead again that number moves in both directions every quarter for many different reasons because of the many lines that are in there brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and could you just remind me carlos it looks like other in the other service fees theres third quarter upward seasonality thatll come through thats still the expectation right a thats the insurance right carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes i mean theres we get contingent insurance commissions paid out once or twice a year it depends on the insurance company that we have were dealing with it tends to be in the second half of the year i dont remember its exactly the third quarter brody but it tends to be in the second half of the year of course the other thing that has to happen is that the insurance market has to behave nicely for them to pay with the contingent fees but that will be the second half of the year yes brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you very much ill hop back in the queue operator thank you the next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please proceed popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc good morning how are you timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc appreciate the good appreciate the comments on the expected range of public funds kind of billion to billion exiting the year maybe talking to second quarter specifically can you just give an update on the magnitude of seasonal inflows youre expecting in the quarter kind of timing of those and then ultimately where we could expect gaap nim and nii to kind of bottom out before starting the ramp higher in the back end of the year to your comments carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes well the in the second quarter we have tax revenues so as they were mentioned before we expect government deposits to go up this quarter and weve seen some of that we already mentioned that deposits are up million so far this quarter so while its harder for me to tell you as exactly if theyre going to end higher than because that depends on what the government chooses to do with their money which is not our decision historically they have tended to be higher in the second quarter and then gravitate down in the second half of the year what was your question on nim again timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc just if you can provide any kind of magnitude on where nim or nii could bottom in prior to resuming the ramp higher in the back end of the year carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc no we usually dont give guidance on that type of detail we as i mentioned in my prepared remarks we still expect nim to take an upward trend again this year the difficult part of that is that it depends on how the things i mentioned interact that will give us the final this timing on when it is going to shift so its going to be a pace of increasing rates loan growth and loan mix and also deposit balances and mix and how those three things interact is what results in the ultimate nim so we still think its going to revert to an expansion mode this year but for the time being we have not spoken over the timing timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe one for lidio excluding the impact of allowance levels continue to build despite the broader trends on the island improving can you maybe talk about some of the levers that were pulled within the portfolio changes that called for incremental allowance and what do you need to see prior to releasing some popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 of the incremental allowance and getting closer to a level maybe not where mainland peers are but at least starting to trend in that direction lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc but the thing is a lot of different levers that were applied during this quarter as we mentioned we have been doing good in terms of volume so the volume increase they have role small role in terms of increase in allowance the economic scenario also played a small role in terms of the increasing allowance then you also have volume mix we changed we gravitated to some of our higher allowance portfolio that also had a gradual impact in allowance which also have seen some gravitation some consumer score that also ph had a small impacting allowance so a combination of a lot of small things so its the interplay of all of that and they continue low pro forma net chargeoff that will dictate allowance going forward underlying timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and just great and just last for me maybe back to carlos can you provide an update on merchant acquiring and the revenue share component how thats trending and maybe an outlook for both and there carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc well we dont break out that number timur but we did talk about the volume of credit and debit cards going up versus the same quarter last year it will go down versus the ph last quarter because it fixed the lines in all so the business keeps growing were getting a share of that so i presume the number is going up but we dont have and i dont think well disclose in detail that number timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you ill step back operator thank you the next question comes from the line of alex twerdahl with piper sandler please proceed alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co first off i was wondering if you can give us an update on expectations for loan balance outlook over the next couple of quarters popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc up no i mean im sorry to repeat no as you know we dont give specific loan balance guidance we did say that we expect loan growth this year and we are seeing that but we also expect it to be on a lower pace than we saw last year and were seeing that as well so the first quarter was a good quarter it was a bit quieter than the first quarter of last year obviously hopefully the economy locally in puerto rico particularly continues to grow and more projects come online well have more ph opportunities to close all the expected supply so im hopeful if they get better as the year goes along i do not think even when it gets better that it will come to match last years growth alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and do you think growth comes from basically all categories as you saw in the first quarter or indiscernible carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes so far thats what weve seen in puerto rico and thats actually been true since the middle of last year alex so we probably will continue to be in most categories but dollar terms obviously the category that carries the day is commercial so in dollars its going to be mostly commercial but we probably will see most categories continue to grow autos is growing a bit less thats a little bit slower than it did last year and well see how that how the year evolves so there is the effect of higher rates and how that affects the appetite of people for loans well have to see how that plays out during the year as well alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay to that last point on rates and appetite can you give us a sense for where new loan yields are relative to the existing portfolio for consumer i mean for a commercial primarily carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc i mean the best we can do we can do on that alex is in our loans and yields on the press release you have loan yields by category and you can see the variation from last quarter to this quarter we dont provide sort of any more detail on yields than that alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay can you on in the slide deck on the deposit slide can you just help us understand exactly whats happening in the commercial deposits as well as the government deposits towards the end of the quarter it looks like those rates ticked down a little bit carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 yes ill explain commercial and one of my colleagues here will explain you the public sector in the commercial its actually quite simple we had a large relationship with a profit aggregator that exited we exited in early february and that was a very high cost so the cost actually dipped that contributed ph to the transaction rate coming down in february and march so that was an actual sort of transaction decision that we did that affected that one on the public deposits paul j cardillo a investor relations officer popular inc hey alex its paul so on the public deposits or for all the charts we actually provide the data points as part of the analysis on a monthly basis and so given a variety of inputs including day count and average balances and whatnot the calculation does move around a little bit carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc and the lag paul j cardillo a investor relations officer popular inc along with the lagged effect of the repricing so if you look back prior in that chart what you can see is it does jump around a little bit during certain time periods even when the at least the comparative chart of the fed funds is moving directionally so thats all that this is we do expect that those that that repricing has not yet been completed and we talked about sort of another basis points roughly in the second quarter alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful and then with respect to the nim commentary about resuming upward trajectory is that is there a scenario where that could happen in the second quarter carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes if you move around in your model the three things i mentioned pace of interest rate increases loan growth and mix and deposit balances and mix im sure theres a number of possible combinations that will give you a higher nim in the second quarter but it depends on how those three things move alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks for taking my questions carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc thank you operator thank you the next question comes from the line of kelly motta with kbw please proceed popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi thanks for the question i think ill carry on with that at least a portion of that nim question carlos one of the things that you had mentioned was youre carrying higher balances at the fed just out of conservatism do you mind sharing what you guys view as an appropriate level of cash you have on hand right now and what are the things we should be looking for to toggle that either up or down do you need clarity from the regulators in order to take that down just interested in what we should be looking for as we think about the liquidity number ahead carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes i mean to a large extent what you see in our fed accounts right in our cash position right now is a lot of that maturity thats happened in our investment portfolio in the first quarter minus the loan growth that we had for the quarters thats the outcome of those two things is the number in there now well keep watching this closely and evaluating the environment an ongoing basis kelly so i we dont were not running it on the basis of a target amount of cash necessarily we are running the business and the business results in an amount of cash what we did decide in the first quarter was to allow the portfolio to mature without reinvesting or extending it again again that is a discussion that we have in our weekly outcome meetings and we evaluate all the parts and come to conclusions on a dynamic basis so there isnt a target the level where we are at this sort of seems to make sense to us its not a tough decision because at this point in time cash the cash ph the yield in cash is not bad so its not a horrible decision to have cash to the fed so well keep looking at it again and that position though unlikely will that position be have what it is unlikely but it will probably gravitate around where it is and if we make a decision to reinvest or move some of the cash to the investment portfolio it will not change the characteristics of our cash position because some of that will be tbills but it will change the nature of our tax position kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc understood i appreciate the color thinking about the buyback in order to get more comfort with the buyback do you think the board needs the regulators to come out with additional guidelines on that front in with whats gone on in march just any sort of color as to what could get you guys more interested in buy back stock here carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes i mean what we what we so what we described in october is that we wanted more clarity on rates and the economy so that we could be more informed in making any decision in capital return and that we thought that clarity may be available by the summer frankly im not sure if we have significantly more clarity now than we had then so hopefully we get clarity by the summer but im not sure were there yet i think the more important thing is what you mentioned that which we have added to those two considerations the consideration of regulatory changes it is anybodys guess exactly what the regulators will come up with we do not know but we will be attentive to how they are how they are moving we definitely dont want to be in a position where we do something ph and theres a clarity announcement a month later and it makes our life much more difficult because we did something that moved us in the wrong direction popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 so well be looking at all those things its hard to gauge right now ph whether orders will come out kelly so were paying attention and listening so its three things now that were waiting to get some clarity on that too so well just see how it goes along kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and just to sneak a last one in on the capital front is the dividend we had discussions about the buyback you usually have a dividend raise in i think thats part of your capital whole capital discussion but wondering if theres any updated even if a buyback isnt in the cards necessarily is are you still thinking about the dividend the same way in any target for a payout ratio on that carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes we tend to work the two things together but i think that youre right in pointing out they dont have to be together so its something that we will continue to consider again i mean i think probably step back for a minute the more important point to make is our longterm view on capital hasnt changed we still expect over time that our capital ratios will go in the direction of our mainland peers plus a spread but that is over time that doesnt mean every quarter in a perfect sequence number one and number two now we have the other uncertainty that we have no idea where our peers will be required to be if the rules change so well have to keep those things in mind kelly motta q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay ill step back thank you so much for the questions operator thank you the next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group please proceed q hey guys good morning this is ph brian calling in for brett carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc hi ph brian q just wanted to go quickly back yes thanks i just want to go quickly back to deposits i appreciate the detail on the liquidity and deposits slide you added looks like demand deposits decreased similarly to what we saw last quarter do you guys expect a steady mix shift over into interestbearing accounts from ph dba and then on the deposit beta as well you mentioned that most of the segments are at or above their prior cycle deposit beta and you guys on the island maintain an advantage to the mainland but just wanted to know if you expect those betas to increase notably above the prior cycle thanks popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes on demand deposits i think that the message in demand deposits ph brian is that theyve been very steady actually and we have seen as i mentioned some commercial clients and some high net worth clients seek higher yields we have also been successful when the clients are in that position to help them achieve that without leaving the relationship or shrinking the relationship with us we had increase in assets under management of popular securities ph of over million over million in the first quarter which is exactly that but the fact that that happened and you see the demand deposits from the fourth to the first quarter were flat means that somebody else brought in million so demand deposits have been quite steady actually most of the volatility weve seen in the volume or the levels have been in our interestbearing accounts and as you know some of the big chunks or big movements happen in our public sector accounts that are our large depositors right and im sorry but i missed the second part of your question ph brian q just on the carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc oh the deposit q deposit betas compared to the prior cycle carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes well weve seen deposit betas accelerate as probably every bank in the country has so the rates have gone up so fast and so high so we are above the last cycle so i dont think we have to the chances are that the betas for all banks will probably end up higher than last cycle in this cycle just because of the speed and magnitude of how the fed raise rates so thats probably whats going to end up happening specifically in our case its hard to tell when you look at for example a big chunk of our deposit business which is retail and commercial and puerto rico continues to have a sub10 beta so overall betas will accelerate i think is our view they are already be above the last cycle theres a reasonable ph chance that the overall beta will be higher than the last cycle but there is pieces of our business that continue to show a lot of strength particularly the nonpublic pricing in puerto rico q popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 all right great thanks for all the color thats it for me thanks operator thank you the next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning everyone this is thomas leddy calling on behalf of gerard carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc hi thomas thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc a couple of quarters ago you guys mentioned that you had not seen any new entrants into the market for lending and pr such as from mainland banks that havent historically been as active there but you thought you might see some increased competition for some of the big pending infrastructure projects there has that dynamic changed at all in light of recent events and any additional color you can provide there carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc i dont think it changed very much it really is the size of the investment is important obviously because not every bank can make every sized loan but when you have foreign operators that come into puerto rico to run a public private partnership for example they have worldwide banking relationships and those relationships arrive to puerto rico with them in almost every instance they want a local bank with our experience and capabilities to help them so we end up either leading or being an important part of any effort to finance those kind of projects so i dont think that its a change from what weve experienced in the past and hopefully some of these projects will get going pretty soon theres a number of the publicprivate partnerships that are supposed to be closer to realization now than they were months ago and if does happen that would be a welcome event javier d ferrer a executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc i just want to add to carloss comments thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you javier d ferrer a executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc i just want to add to carloss comments that in fact we are i could say engaged in those ppp projects so we expect to have those come to fruition if the government moves quickly this year so well play an important part in those financings as we ph expected prior popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thank you and then just a quick followup high level obviously credit quality remains pretty strong what trends in credit are you guys watching most closely today and how have those changed over the past couple quarters lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc i will say the performance and the shift in the fico mix of our books and the performance of the small and medium enterprises in our commercial books those will be the two particular elements that were watching closely thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you operator thank you we have a followup question from the line of brody preston with ubs please proceed brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys just had a couple of quick followups i did want to touch on the consumer line of credit chargeoffs that you called out just i wanted to clarify it was called the line of credit i just wanted to ask if that was one line of credit or if that was multiple lines of credit lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vprisk management popular inc it was one line of credit it is a legacy oneoff type of relationship that shouldnt recur in the future brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then i just want to ask one on the deposit mix you guys outperformed the industry by a wide margin on noninterest bearing so just wanted to get a sense for what your conversations look like with customers around rates particularly as it relates to like any level of excess funds that might be ph in ddas or do you feel like the noninterestbearing mix can be relatively steady from here carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc yes i mean we have the discussions every day every day every day i mean the best way i can answer that question brody is that weve been having those discussions for the last two quarters and the results are the results so we despite the fact that were having those discussions that we have clients moving cash seeking higher yields we still were able to successfully maintain stable demand deposit balances that does not mean that some money did not move as i said we can track specifically million of those volumes that moved to popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 through our broker dealer but clearly we successfully found another million of demand deposits that ph showed up and joined the bank so so far weve been able to manage those interests of higher yields from our clients successfully were keeping the relationship were serving the client by the way weve been here before and those flows grow by back the other way when rates come down so the important thing here is to keep the relationship so that when rates come down the money does flow back into the bank so i mean thats the best my best guess javier you want javier d ferrer a executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc i just want to add that we saw we saw a very strong new deposit account opening numbers for the first quarter in puerto rico including noninterestbearing accounts so i just wanted to clarify that very high compared to prior quarters brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it got it carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc ph actually our net new account opening in the first quarter was higher than it has been for a couple of years javier d ferrer a executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc yes since since the first quarter of brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yes all right thank you very much for the color everyone i appreciate it operator thank you we have a followup question from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo please proceed carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc hello javier d ferrer a executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc timur are you there popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes sorry about that i had you on mute thanks for the followup one last one for me on the expense base appreciate the color on the reduction in the first quarter and the expectation for it to ramp higher as the year goes any additional commentary on the cadence of that increase to get to that unchanged guidance level and then secondarily if you can provide any kind of color as to what type of internal budget youre using for this years profitsharing initiative carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc okay on the second question there is personally no incorporation of any profit sharing in our numbers or our forwardlooking so nothing on that is in our numbers or our forwardlooking outlook at this point in time on your first question its tough to tell because it depends on when the projects get going and when the people that are helping us in this project actually bill us so i would assume that it will be straight line up that would be my best assumption right now for in the next three quarters to reach the goal but its the best i can do i have a colleague here telling me what what so this is my do it straight line in your model its probably not going to be far from the truth paul j cardillo a investor relations officer popular inc ill just clarify we dont we do accrue indiscernible on services provided we dont wait for being billed necessarily carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc okay paul j cardillo a investor relations officer popular inc but of course timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then i guess once of those projects javier d ferrer a executive vice president chief operating officer head of business strategy corporate secretary popular inc ph this is a better for expenses popular inc bpop corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc im sorry timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess once those projects start to rampup is the expectation going forward that those expenses remain on or is it going to be as lumpy as weve seen in the first quarter carlos j vázquez a chief financial officer executive vice president popular inc well it will depend on the project brody sorry timur if its a if its a it will depend on the project i dont think theres a global answer to your question a the project and the number of projects that are ongoing at the same time timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay makes sense a were just moving from the theory and the planning to execution its just how quickly we can get all those plans going timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator thank you operator instructions there are no additional questions at this time i will now hand the call back over to javier ferrer for closing
