the fourth quarter we reported per diluted share or after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition this was a complex quarter that included one month of union bank results merger integration charges and balance sheet optimization activity terry will provide more details on these notable items importantly we ended the year with a common equity tier ratio of which was just above our expected level at deal close and we delivered positive operating leverage for us bancorp legacy operations of basis points for the fullyear strong year overyear pretax provision income growth as adjusted for notable items was driven by net interest income growth and positive operating leverage credit quality remained strong although credit metrics are starting to normalize as expected slide details are reported and adjusted income statement results as well as endofperiod balances and other performance metrics endofperiod assets for the company totaled billion reflecting the acquisition of union bank and certain balance sheet optimization actions slide highlights key performance ratios this quarter we delivered a return on average assets of a return of average common equity of and a return on tangible common equity of each as adjusted for notable items us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 turning to slide the completion of the union bank acquisition marked a significant milestone for our company with doubledigit percent increases in loan and deposit balances union bank adds meaningful scale to our business that enables us to better serve our customers and communities union contributes considerable small business and consumer market share in a demographically attractive california market and were excited about the potential to deepen existing union bank relationships by overlaying our leading digital capabilities and robust product set including wealth management consumer and business banking and payments offerings across a loyal but underpenetrated consumer base in many ways this deal underscores our commitment to creating a stronger more competitive regional banking organization in a rapidly evolving environment one of the more attractive aspects of this transaction is union banks highquality lowcost consumer deposit franchise which will support continued loan growth and margins let me turn the call over now to terry who will provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide as andy mentioned we reported diluted earnings per share of for the quarter or per share after adjusting for notable items related to the acquisition notable items related to union bank acquisition are comprised of three primary elements that reduced earnings per share by related to balance sheet optimization merger and integration costs and the impacts on provision expense related to acquired loans and actions taken to optimize the balance sheet during the fourth quarter the company recognized a onetime million pretax loss on a net basis related to several actions taken to optimize the balance sheet managed the interest rate volatility impact on capital levels and position the company for future growth subsequent to obtaining regulatory approval for the transaction we entered into interest rate hedges to manage rate volatility and its related impact on regulatory capital from the date of approval through the closing of the transaction in december during that timeframe longterm interest rates increased nearly basis points before declining approximately basis points the interest rate swaps were terminated at the time of closing and the losses recognized through earnings largely offset the interest rate marks recorded into the balance sheet through purchase accounting in addition the company optimized its balance sheet by selling certain loans and repositioning its investment portfolio on certain equity investments within noninterest expenses we incurred merger and integrationrelated charges of million that primarily included the impact of specific deal closing costs professional services and employeerelated expenses we also incurred a million charge to the provision for credit losses which reflects an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of million and a net loss of million related to the securitization of approximately billion of legacy indirect auto loans again these moves enabled us to more effectively position the balance sheet for profitable growth and optimize returns slide provides a more detailed earnings summary union bank which was included in our consolidated results for one month contributed million of revenue million of noninterest expenses million of operating income and million of net income to the company representing per diluted share on slide endofperiod loans increased on a linkedquarter basis to billion which included core loan growth and acquired loans from union bank union bank contributed ending loan balances of billion net of purchase accounting adjustments partly offset by a reduction in balances of billion related to balance sheet optimization actions including loan sales and securitizations slide provides endofperiod deposit balance composition endofperiod deposits increased on a linkedquarter basis to billion driven by the acquisition which contributed billion of lower cost deposits us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 and actions taken as a result of the deal to optimize our funding sources on a core basis we saw deposit balances decline slightly this quarter turning to slide the investment securities portfolio grew linkedquarter to billion the additional securities from union bank were offset by balance sheet optimization actions slide highlights revenue trends adjusted net revenue totaled billion in the fourth quarter which included revenue contribution of million from union bank primarily representing net interest income for legacy us bancorp net interest income grew on a linkedquarter basis and yearoveryear driven by a strong earning asset growth and net interest margin expansion which benefited from rising interest rates results were partially offset by higher deposit pricing and shortterm borrowing costs noninterest income as adjusted for the legacy company declined compared to the third quarter driven by a seasonally lower payment service revenue and lower commercial product revenue offset by stronger mortgage banking revenue yearoveryear legacy adjusted noninterest income declined driven by lower mortgage banking revenue from reduced refinancing activity and lower servicing charges offset by stronger payment services revenue and trust and investment management fees turning to slide adjusted noninterest expense totaled billion in the fourth quarter including million from union bank included in expenses was approximately million of intangible amortization due to core deposit intangibles established at the time of the acquisition legacy noninterest expense as adjusted increased on a linkedquarter basis largely driven by higher compensationrelated expenses as well as higher expenses related to professional services marketing technology and tax credit amortization slide shows credit quality trends we reported total net chargeoffs for the quarter of million after adjusting for acquisition impacts and the balance sheet optimization activities net chargeoffs totaled million or of average loans up from in the third quarter which reflected the continuing normalization of credit losses nonperforming assets for the legacy bank increased slightly while union bank contributed million to the total on a combined basis the reported ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at december compared with at september and a year ago reflecting a continued strong credit quality the provision for credit losses was billion which included a provision of million related to the acquisition and balance sheet optimization activities this provision includes an initial provision impacted by the acquisition of million and million related to our balance sheet optimization activities the allowance for credit losses as of december totaled billion or of periodend loans which reflects increased economic uncertainty and the incorporation of the union bank portfolio slide highlights the drivers of our linkedquarter common equity tier capital position as of december our cet1 capital ratio was acquisition impacts of basis points included an increase in goodwill and other intangible assets that reflected the impact of credit and interest rate marks the initial provision for credit losses balance sheet optimization actions as well as the increase in riskweighted assets with the addition of union bank these impacts were partially offset by an increase to equity related to the shares issued to mufg as part of the purchase price of union bank us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 slide provides our current expectations of certain financial metrics related to the transaction the financial and strategic merits of the deal remain intact and are very attractive earnings per share accretion is now expected to be to in which is higher than originally estimated while our tangible book value per share dilution is higher than initially estimated due to the significant impact of rising interest rates on the interest rate marks at close our estimated earnback period is only slightly longer than our original estimate at two years versus our original estimate of years slide provides a comparison of credit and net fair value marks from the time of our announcement to closing credit marks are lower due to favorable changes in portfolio composition and credit quality partially offset by economic deterioration interest rate marks inclusive of loans securities net of sales and debt are higher than anticipated at announcement due to higher interest rates but we expect that to accrete quickly back through earnings the core deposit intangible is also higher than originally estimated reflecting the increased value of lower cost core deposits in a higher rate environment i will now provide first quarter and fullyear forwardlooking guidance which is provided on slide starting with the first quarter guidance we expect average earning assets of between million and billion in the first quarter and the net interest margin that is to basis points higher than the fourth quarter level total revenue is estimated to be in the range of billion to billion including approximately million of purchase accounting accretion during the quarter total noninterest expense as adjusted is expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of approximately million of core deposit intangible amortization related to union bank our income tax rate as adjusted is expected to be approximately to on a taxableequivalent basis we anticipate merger and integration charges of between million and million for the quarter i will now provide guidance for the fullyear for average earning assets are expected to be in the range of billion to billion with net interest margin expansion of between to basis points compared with the fourth quarter of total revenue is expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of between million to million of fullyear purchase accounting accretion total noninterest expense as adjusted for the year is expected to be in the range of billion to billion inclusive of approximately million of core deposit intangible amortization related to union bank our estimated fullyear income tax rate on a taxableequivalent basis as adjusted will be approximately to we expect to have million to billion of merger and integration charges in i will now hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry we accomplished a lot this past year including the completion of the union bank acquisition and a strong legacy ppnr growth supported by positive operating leverage on an adjusted basis union bank adds significant scale to our business and deepens our commitment to serving customers and creating economic opportunities for communities across the west coast we continue to target a memorial day weekend systems conversion incorporating a liftandshift approach to our applications which mitigates risk and allows us to more quickly capture meaningful cost synergies there is still a tremendous amount of economic and geopolitical uncertainty and we are preparing for any scenario i believe we will perform well because of the strength of our business our strong balance sheet and the great team we have as weve proven during previous economic downturns our business model is resilient and recessionready in large part due to our disciplined throughthe cycle credit underwriting standards and robust risk management infrastructure our consumer clients are predominantly prime super prime and our commercial book is generally investmentgrade and we have very little us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 leverage lending commitments we are focused on prudent balance sheet growth highreturn highmargin opportunities and the prudent allocation of capital to lines of business and products best served to deliver on our strategic objectives our growth strategy is focused on creating value for our customers communities and shareholders which allow us to generate industryleading performance let me close by saying thank you to our employees across the company including our newest colleagues from union bank your dedication and commitment are what make us bank special and the destination of choice for all the constituents we serve well now open up the call for qa question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and we can first go to scott siefers with piper sandler please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning scott andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co maybe a question for you just sort at the toplevel i was hoping you could speak to what sort of balance sheet and capital management will look like for you so youre still under billion in assets but any thought on sort of limiting growth or will there be additional sales or securitizations to help keep you under there and then i guess on repurchase i know were on pause until we get back to the common equity tier target but with the sort of looming category move up would there be any thought to hold off longer than that just to sort of see what happens just any thoughts on either of those would be great please andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp scott ill start this is andy and terry will add in so first of all were not limiting growth in the company one of the reasons we positioned the balance sheet and took the optimization actions we talked about that terry went through was to allow for profitable growth it also was related to the credit box that we managed within as well as the returns that some of those categories of assets that we securitized were returning so those are all allowing us to grow in a profitable way in the future as weve talked about before we do not expect to cross the threshold of a cat ii until the earliest at the end of and thats into the new category at that time and if we have any further balance sheet optimization actions at securitizations they would be very nominal and not material in nature terry what would you add us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah no i would just again reiterate were ready to be able to adopt category ii by the end of but theres no real cap we wouldnt expect any real significant balance sheet optimization from here and we spent a lot of time positioning the balance sheet for growth as we go forward r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful and then just sort of thoughts on repurchase as well i know were on pause for now but its still sort of a question mark so would be curious to your thoughts andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah scott so as weve said in that we continue to expect that we are starting about at a good spot about cet1 we expect that to accrete up to at or above by the end of next year and it continued to accrete and continued to move up from that particular point so one of the things well do is once we get to above well have to make an assessment as to all the different things that are happening out there from a regulatory perspective i mean you have the regulators looking at basel iii and are having to think about category ii and those sorts of things but i think its really going to be based upon what the landscape at that particular point in time looks like but certainly in terms of our core cet1 it will accrete nicely throughout r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful all right appreciate all the thoughts thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks scott operator next we can go to erika najarian with ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning and thank you for andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc all the details that you gave us on the slides my first question is on the cadence of the cost synergies as it relates to your expected memorial day weekend conversion so first clarification question the cost synergies is that a target for fullyear and what is that cadence like do we expect very little in cost us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 synergies until memorial day weekend and then an acceleration in cost synergy capture as the systems converge terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah erika great question and just to confirm our expectation is that of the million of cost synergies well see about of that next year in and so from a cadence standpoint with the memorial day conversion the vast majority of those cost synergies will start to really kick in subsequent to that system conversion so smaller during the firsthalf of the year much more significant of that in the secondhalf of the year erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it so in other words we should anticipate an exit rate by of well above terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah by the time we get to the end of the fourth quarter we will have incorporated the vast majority of the cost synergies such that by the time we get to we will be in a good position to have achieved erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my followup question is on the economic outlook if you could remind us what is being captured in the legacy us bank reserves in terms of the gdp outlook and the unemployment outlook and how are you thinking based on that outlook chargeoffs for legacy us bank would trend as we anticipate it seems like a lot of your peers are anticipating a mild recession from here terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i would say that our expectations are probably consistent with that sort of a thought process when we are thinking about the reserve our base case is that if there is a mild recession probably in the secondhalf of the year and that unemployment ticks up and gdp is either relatively flat or down a bit when we go through the reserving process as weve said in the past we end up looking at five different potential scenarios all the way from a base case to a severe sort of recession and i would say that from a reserving perspective were a little bit weighted towards that downside scenario so a little bit more conservative from a chargeoff perspective our expectation kind of using the baseline of about basis points in the fourth quarter that that will continue to normalize throughout the year well see both the delinquencies and chargeoffs moving up but to kind of give you some perspective our prepandemic was at basis points we probably dont see that until sometime into erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 thanks erika operator and next we can go to mike mayo of wells fargo securities please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi hey good morning i just wanted to clarify so you made your positive operating leverage in over basis points if you back into the numbers im getting positive operating leverage yearoveryear allin of somewhere between i dont know to basis points im not sure if thats correct and if you back into the numbers what do you get and why the such big variance in the revenue guide thats billion versus billion and why is the margin still increasing to basis points in the fourth quarter thats a bit more of an improvement versus others a 05g3jte andy cecere so ill start on a couple of things and then terry will add in so let me sort of go backwards on your questions the margin is increasing principally because of the value of the lowcost deposits that union bank brings on we talked about that a lot mike and billion of principally consumer lowcost stable deposits in this environment is very valuable in driving up that margin on a quarterly basis and thats reflected in that to basis points we did achieve basis points of positive operating leverage in i can hear a little bit of background george andersen a investor relations contact us bancorp hey mike were getting a little background can you mute your line thanks a 05g3jte andy cecere we did achieve basis points of positive operating leverage in we would expect to achieve continued positive operating leverage into but is going to have the mergerrelated charges in it as well so im looking at it on a core basis and terry what would you add terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah just maybe kind of coming back to the net interest margin we expect see a lift related to union bank coming on that to basis points and then from there kind of flattish to maybe moderate increase or expansion in net interest margin through the rest of the year but clearly deposit betas and things like that are going to accelerate a bit in mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and as a followup look us bancorp had been a lowcost producer for a long time it looks like youre going to trend back in that direction so it sounds like you still have no change in expected synergies i get it union bank us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 is performing better and thats why the accretion you had brought higher the to but still no change in expected synergies from the acquisition and then separate from that andy you mentioned in december that the big kind of tech investment cycle is now turning positive versus being a drag the last fiveorso years if you could elaborate on that thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure mike and youre right we still are projecting as terry went through million of cost savings in fully implemented in importantly we have not in the guidance that we provided provided any revenue synergies so its without revenue synergies which we think there are going to be some particularly after the integration and conversion process we are past the heavy spend on tech youre right were more of at a flat line and starting to gain the benefits of that and part of the benefit of this transaction is leveraging the investments weve made in the company over the last three or four years to allow us to lift and shift to our technology platform in a very low cost way so that benefit is driving through the synergies that we talk about mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks mike operator and now well go to john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning john andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning so on the credit metrics i know you indicated that youre starting to see normalization in charge offs and delinquencies i wanted to see if you can elaborate a bit more on what income cohorts are you seeing the normalization were hearing from some of the consumer finance players that they are seeing some normalization impacting or moving beyond just the nonprime and low income but into prime and super prime us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 and also what asset classes are you seeing the normalization most obviously is it just on the card side or in other asset classes thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean i this is terry so maybe to address your first question in terms of where were seeing it and maybe as kind of a reminder from an underwriting perspective we focus on prime super prime really in all of our consumer portfolios to the extent that were seeing delinquencies starting to tick up its more so in the credit card space and youre right it would be probably on the lower bands as opposed to the upper bands at this particular point in time but one of the things we talked about is that when you look at savings or excess savings from a consumer perspective theyre fairly significant that is coming down as thats coming down people are revolving more on their credit cards and i think its just kind of a natural progression that we are seeing and again starting more with the unsecured and the credit card portfolio not as much with respect to the other portfolios yet but as things continue to normalize we would expect that too john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks terry thats helpful and then i guess related how does this development in consumer behavior and your macro assumptions as well how does that impact your expectations for your payments revenue and your card revenue and merchant processing revenue as you look out through the year considering the macro dynamics thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah so the payments revenue as you saw still is well above precovid levels the card spend is above on a yearoveryear basis were plus so spend continues to be strong the categories of spend are shifting a little bit and we would expect continued strong spend but moderating a bit as we go into the rest of for the reasons that terry mentioned but still expect growth but again probably more moderate in nature as we go forward and the savings level start to normalize and the consumer behavior starts to change terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah and the thing that i would end up adding john is that one of the things weve talked about in the merchant processing is that we think that business is kind of a highsingle digits and when we look at thats kind of our expectation for that particular business relative to we anticipate that our credit card revenue our cards revenue will strengthen a bit in terms of yearoveryear comparisons and that is primarily because prepaid sales and prepaid revenue which has been a drag kind of starts to moderate and then on the corporate payment card business we continue to think that thats going to be reasonably strong certainly highsingle digits if not lowdouble digits and thats were continuing to see travel and entertainment recover very nicely in that particular space so we feel pretty good about the payment revenue trends for john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thank you terry appreciate it us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes operator next we can go to ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i just want to followup one on credit so you talked about consumer looking at the cre slide just if you dont mind talking sharing your perspective around the cre book if youre beginning to see any softening either in certain markets maybe california or within the office cre book which is about of loans terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean maybe at a high level certainly from a cre perspective valuations i think are moderating to some extent the areas that we have had probably the greatest focus on if you will is really office space and that is really probably as much tied to return to office sort of behaviors or patterns and i think that that is probably a longerterm sort of structural adjustment thats going to end up happening and were just going to have to watch it over time but when we just kind of look at the core cre portfolio it continues to perform pretty well from a credit perspective at this particular point ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it and i guess just one separate question around payments when you think about in your slide you mentioned about some of the tech investments and partnerships just give us a sense of remind us around competitive positioning for usb how youre thinking about just market share outlook and from this partnership standpoint like areas of like secular growth that you see in this business andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah as you mentioned weve made a lot of investments in techled activity and our techled investments have led to that being the principal area of growth for the merchant processing categories and then on the card side the partnerships component continues to be an important strength for us and a point of growth as we look forward so those two areas techled on merchant and partnerships on card are doing well and its partly due to the investments weve made over the past few years us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch and is the strategy there to just build this inhouse or do you see more kind of bolton acquisitions within that business andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp many of the investments we made are internal investments that weve developed our capabilities and our platforms to allow for different activities and allow for integration with some of the software that the company has used to run their business weve added as well as you know miscellaneous ma acquisitions that you said boltons like a talech or a bento that add capabilities around the edges and i think well continue to do a little of both as we look forward ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure operator and we can go to gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning gerard andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi andy hi terry congratulations on closing the deal question for you terry on the balance sheet optimization where you guys decided to sell off certain loans that were acquired can you give us some color on what types of credits were in those sales and why would they chose i know they didnt meet your credit profile but what was the driver of that i mean some of the details of the credit profiles terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah maybe as a starting point when we thought about the balance sheet optimization the things that we were thinking about is really repositioning the balance sheet to position ourselves for growth going forward to be able to optimize or improve profitability and looking at profit margins across the various portfolios and returns and then the risk profile us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 so maybe from a risk profile perspective we ended up looking at union bank portfolios that we end up acquiring and there were a couple of different areas that we focused on one is that they had acquired a number of loans related or through a lending club channel if you will and that was something that we had planned to run off over time originally when we looked at the deal and we made a decision that when we looked at the kind of the credit risk profile how its originated et cetera that we thought that taking care of that upfront made a lot of sense the other area that we ended up selling was some commercial real estate in their particular portfolios in order to be able to kind of bring that concentration down a bit and then the other areas of optimization was more on the us bank side we ended up looking at lower margin indirect auto loan portfolio we securitized about billion associated with that particular portfolio and then the other things that we ended up looking at in the ci book of business and across kind of our corporate space is just relationships that maybe had lower returns associated with it where we could optimize that and so we allowed some of that to run off so to speak during the quarter and those were the primary areas of focus with respect to the balance sheet optimization the last thing i would maybe say on the investment portfolio side is that we ended up selling about billion of securities the vast majority of that coming from union bank and that was really to kind of think about it from a interest rate risk perspective htm perspective et cetera but that was the other area where we did some balance sheet optimization gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc terry in the corporate loans were there any shared relationships meaning you had an exposure to xyz company as did union bank and the total was maybe too much and you guys decided to take that down as well terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah yeah exactly so maybe from a risk perspective looking at holds hold levels or concentrations with respect to specific customers yes that was a part of the strategy gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just as a followup you guys obviously gave us very good detail on your slides and on the credit quality slide you give us the breakout in the net chargeoffs and you show us the reported number at bps versus your core legacy number of basis points if i pull out the million from the optimization it looks like the net chargeoff ratio is around basis points including the union bank numbers is that kind of the level we should kind of gear ourselves to for now that union will be fully implemented into your business terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah let me clarify so its basis points on a reported basis basis points on a core basis and theres two components to that core the balance sheet securitization that i talked about that you articulated but then under cecl what you end up having to do is you have to recapture loans that they have chargedoff you have to make an assessment and then if you believe that that chargeoff was appropriate youd have to charge that off on day so to speak us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 and there was about million of chargeoffs related to that kind of day one effect associated with cecl so theres really kind of three components but on a reported basis on a core basis and when we think about going forward i would use the basis points as kind of the start point and thats about million worth of core chargeoffs gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you for clearing that up i appreciate it terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah operator and next we can go to betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi and congratulations from my end too and the deck is super clear i really appreciate all the effort to make it simple and straightforward so a couple of questions for me just to followup on the discussion we just had could we also talk a little bit about how we should think about the reserving level as we go through and into because like you said youve got the fair value marks you had to do the day you had to do the add as per the cecl rules so does reserve ratio stabilize from here does it actually inch down is there a scenario in which it would move higher could you just frame out on how we should think about that thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean obviously it is impacted by a lot of different things in terms of how economic uncertainty ends up changing and the mix of the portfolio how it might change but as we kind of think about i think that that basis points is probably a good is a good metric throughout the year it might inch down a little bit but i think that by and large we feel pretty comfortable with that as we think about based upon our kind of base case so to speak betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then i have one other question on the growth of the balance sheet i know you addressed this a bit before but when i look at the guide versus its a slower growth rate than i think were used to us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 seeing at usb so maybe you could help us understand is this a moderated growth rate during the integration phase and maybe secondhalf that should accelerate up or is this the level of growth that we should anticipate and then if you dont mind i have just a couple of tickytackies on the purchase accounting and the cdi and how we should expect that steps down into and andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp sure betsy this is andy so first on the growth rate i think had exceptional loan growth across many categories led by commercial as well as cre so what we would see is that more normalizing you started to see that in the fourth quarter and i think the other fact is that the growth rates are impacted by average balances and some of the optimization activity that we took down in the fourth quarter it was a partial quarter in the fourth quarter full quarter in the first quarter and the rest of but the principal driver is a function of loan demand which is moderating a bit across most categories so still growing but a little less than what we saw in terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp and then betsy maybe related to your second question which was around the recognition of the core deposit intangible over time probably the way that i would think about it is that its it will amortize into income over about a 10year period it will step down and probably a good way of just modeling it is assuming kind of a sumofthe years digit sort of approach betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and same thing for paa or how should we think about that i mean paa i know its different but ph should we expect paa change terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so thats tied obviously to the life of the loans and it will end up being impacted by prepayments and all sorts of things we ended up looking at their portfolio that we acquired about half of it is residential mortgage and half of it is corporate in shorterterm so probably if you ended up looking at an average life of four five years four to six years that sort of timeframe and of course that will also accrete probably a little bit faster on the front end betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you for that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes thanks betsy operator and next well go to vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 good morning vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning congratulations a couple of questions the tangible book value recovery the crossover and the fact that youd recover that back quickly can you just give any color on sort of whats the key driver of that is it just simply earnings or is there something else underneath that also thats going to help that come back so quickly terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah its principally the accretion effect that were going to see with respect to union bank the marks and the underlying earnings of the company vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so the because i just heard you say the accretion the question that betsy asked the purchase accounting accretion that half the loans are mortgages so that will take come down i guess over more slowly so is that part of it that prepurchase accounting accretion is going to stay high for longer terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah no i really think its just it really is the kind of the to accretion levels that were expecting on vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc the ub side terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got it okay a couple of other little ones deposits the decline that you had in the balance sheet optimization i think its pretty sizable billion is it all ub or is it some of yours and which types of deposits terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah its a great question from a deposit standpoint when you think about kind of the optimization that we went through we had kind of a focus on a couple of different things we ended up looking at lcr ratios we ended up us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 looking at higher cost deposits whether that would be brokeragetype deposits or eurodollar deposits those sorts of things and we made a very conscious decision after getting regulatory approval to kind of reposition that on the union bank side the one thing that i would point out is that theres about billion to billion worth of deposits that came over that were more transitionary and over time those will transition back to their global investment bank as those customers kind of migrate so about half of that migrated in the fourth quarter and i would expect probably the other half of that to migrate in early but those were kind of the things we ended up looking at with respect to deposit and deposit flows so it was really looking at trading out lowcost deposits or highcost deposits for lowcost deposits that were coming over from union bank and then some of the union bank effect vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc and what was the oci number at the end of the year so as we think about where going to category ii how quickly do you expect that to come down so that you can be in better shape terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so oci at the end of the year is about billion and the duration of the portfolio is a little over so if you can kind of take a look at that obviously thats assuming that rates dont move from here our positioning from an investment portfolio perspective is about htm weve also entered into some pay fixed swaps that in effect kind of get that up to the high so we feel like were in a pretty good position to be able to deal with if rates move up a bit or if rates come down we have some flexibility there as well so we feel like were in a pretty good spot vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thank you operator and next we can go to matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you talk about the pace of the capital build from the to around by the end of the year and then also if the macro is worse than expected and you have to build reserves more i realize that doesnt move the capital that much but obviously everyone else is starting at a higher point of capital and there is focus on how quickly you can get to that or even higher so i guess the question is like what levers can you pull that kind of arent that painful if you need a little bit more such as issuing preferreds or some other assets that you could kind of exit without hitting earnings that much thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean obviously matt from a balance sheet optimization perspective were going to be very focused on profitability returns and capital is precious so we want to make sure that we are dedicating our resources from an asset growth perspective in the right spots us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 the pace of growth from to a little above by the end of its fairly ratable across the four quarters obviously the first quarter is going to be a little bit lower simply because we will not have seen the cost synergies and we will be going through and incurring more mergerrelated costs probably in the earlier part of the year simply because of the timing of the system conversion so the pace is probably a little bit more weighted towards the back end but that hopefully matt kind of gives you some perspective again id kind of come back from a reserve point of view we feel like we look at a lot of different scenarios we look at the five different approaches one of which is a severe recession we take that into consideration we could see unemployment move up to around and we still feel like we would be in pretty good spot from a reserving point of view so if it ends up being at a level thats higher then well have to kind of focus on other balance sheet optimization activity matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks matt terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks matt operator and well go to ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning guys first question i just want to ask is just to follow on the outlook for the year can you walk us through just your underlying assumptions for kind of how nii just trajects if we just think about kind of the core business and in terms of what deposit costs and betas do and how that impacts the underlying trajectory from the fourth quarter of nii terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so obviously the net interest income is going to be driven by the earning asset growth that we have in here as well as the margin expansion we expect that margin expansion to take place to basis points in the first quarter because of the full quarter kind of effect of union bank and then again our modeling is that the margin reasonably moderates from there reasonably flat maybe up just a little bit us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 from a deposit point of view clearly deposit betas are going to accelerate i think thats the reason why youll see the moderation in terms of net interest income or net interest margin expansion in the second half of the year but keep in mind and again this is kind of we see that in the first quarter the union bank effect associated with the value of those deposits that were bringing on and well continue to look at opportunities to kind of optimize the deposit portfolio ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and then just one followup on the deal impact can you just remind us what type of like amortization period youre using for both the purchase accounting accretion and the cdi in terms of like is this the run rate that we keep around for a few years or does that change as you look past thanks terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp well i think that again in we expect the purchase accounting accretion to be million to million and the cdi to be about million as i mentioned earlier i think on the cdi it steps down over time but if you use kind of a 10year assumption and sumoftheyears digits i think that will get you from a modeling perspective pretty close to how i think it will end up amortizing off the purchase accounting is really going to be tied to the asset lives because about half of it is mortgage and half of it is corporate and commercial et cetera and shorterlived assets i think you can think about kind of that four to five year sort of timeframe and it probably accretes down into kind of a similar sort of fashion a little more front end weighted ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you terry terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes operator and next we can go to chris kotowski with oppenheimer please go ahead terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey chris chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc good morning hi following up a bit on mike and kens questions if i look at your very helpful slide on the guidance and i take the midpoint of the billion to billion revenue range and i kind of day weight that to the full year i kind of get the lower range end of the fullyear guidance billion is actually what i get so that implies like a couple percent growth in the backhalf of the year which again i guess is better than what a lot of banks are saying and im wondering is that just underlying loan growth or fee income growth or is it the tagins of the benefits of rising rates or what do you see driving that us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp well again i think you do see kind of the fullyear effect associated with rising interest rates kind of come into play fee revenue on a legacy basis as an example we should see a little bit more of a tailwind next year as opposed to what we experienced this year so i think that those are kind of coming into play and then i think that just the timing of being able to get cost synergies on the expense side andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah and i would add its probably just mathematically as you were talking about it that youre right and its a little bit of a growth in the earning asset that you see there going up from billion to billion to billion to billion thats number one and then maybe going towards the highend of that range and net interest margin versus the mid or lowend in the early quarters chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah chris kotowski q analyst oppenheimer co inc well its interesting because if i do the same analysis on the noninterest expense side youre at the highend of that so it implies kind of nice growth in preprovision earnings through the course of the year so but anyway thats it for me terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp all right andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks chris operator and our last question in queue will come from mike mayo with wells fargo securities andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey mike good morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 indiscernible before aoci was it im just going through the number here billion now its billion and where is it as of today terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp oci overall is at billion at the end of the year and expect it to come down from there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp at a lower level today mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then andy just can you pull the lens back a little bit its been a rough three five and years when you look at operating leverage and stock not last year on the operating leverage but that comment you made in december and you addressed briefly but youve been in this investment cycle multiyears and now you said that youre coming out of it or the drag is less or maybe the spending is less and the payoffs are more can you just give us more color on both the spending side and the payback side and where youve invested the most and where you expect that payback because it sounds like youre crossing a line based on your comment from december that you reiterated today thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yes thanks mike i think thats a fair representation so we our spend levels on pure capex were grew from about million to million to billion billion and that growth has been in the run rate for the last couple of years so you would not expect to see additional continued expense increase related to capex importantly we also migrated that spend from about defensive to offensive so the spend is on activities like digital capabilities reaching customers products and services and so forth so all of that is whats coming through right now so a levelset on the expense side plus a return on the investments from a revenue side that coupled with overlaying all that on the union bank customer base is why were projecting the numbers that were giving you mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator we do have time for one more question and well go to john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 good morning john john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research good morning guys hey just a couple of quick followups so terry where does the balance sheet repositioning and the merger leave you in terms of interest rate positioning and how would you describe it here fairly neutral a little bit assetsensitive where youre ending up now terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i would say that legacy us bank is fairly neutral when we add union bank on it probably adds about basis points of asset sensitivity in a basis points up sort of shock environment john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then on the fee income you said some more tailwinds this year some helpers on legacy us bancorp what are those on the fee income front what are the helpers this year that you can grow fee income maybe just putandtakes on fees real quick terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah well if you just kind of look at the different components i think the payments revenue continues to be reasonably strong i think that the expectation is the market comes back a little bit in terms of investment income but deposit service charges we saw a drag in because of some pricing changes we implemented in may that starts to dissipate so i think it will be kind of a combination of things but probably one of the biggest ones is just mortgage banking revenue that has been a pretty significant drag especially on a yearoveryear basis and in the fourth quarter we actually started to see that inflection point with linkedquarter revenue starting to come up and we would expect that to be a little bit stronger as we go into john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it and then the last clarification i think on reserves you said the ratio looks pretty good for this year even if unemployment went to youd be okay terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again we go through a lot of different scenarios and we take that downside into consideration and as part of kind of that weighted average process we think unemployment is already incorporated into our reserving process so but again it all is going to depend upon what ends up happening how severe the economic recession is if there is one at all so i think theres just a lot of moving parts john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you us bancorp usb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2023 operator and we have no further questions at this time i will now turn it back to george andersen please continue george andersen investor relations contact us
