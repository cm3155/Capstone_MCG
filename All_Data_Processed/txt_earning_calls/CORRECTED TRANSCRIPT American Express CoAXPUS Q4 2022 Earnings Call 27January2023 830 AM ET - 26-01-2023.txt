turn it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks kerri good morning everyone thanks for joining us today its great to be with you to talk about our results and our outlook for as i go through our results ill tell you why they strengthened my confidence in our plan to generate strong growth over the long term a year ago we introduced our growth plan which provided a roadmap for delivering annual growth rates for revenue and earnings per share at levels that are higher than the strong growth rates we were delivering before the pandemic our results over the last four quarters demonstrate that our strategy is clearly working we exceeded the full year guidance we laid out in our growth plan for both revenues and eps and we did so against a mixed economic environment revenues which reached alltime highs for both the quarter and the year were up for the fullyear exceeding the to guidance we started the year with and earnings per share of was well above our guidance of to the momentum we saw through the year in card member spending engagement and american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 retention continued in the fourth quarter fourth quarter billed business reached a record quarterly high of billion and was up for the full year demonstrating our continued ability to acquire engage and retain high spending premium card members customer retention and satisfaction remained very strong in addition to strong internal metrics we were recognized once again by our customers for providing industrybest products and services ranking number one in customer satisfaction in both the jd power us consumer credit card study and the us small business card study the investments weve made in our value propositions continue to attract large numbers of new premium customers we acquired million new card members in the fourth quarter even as we increased our already high credit thresholds through the year for the full year new card acquisitions reached a record level growing to million and nearly of our new accounts acquired are on our feebased products millennial and gen z customers continue to be the largest drivers of our growth representing over of proprietary consumer card acquisitions in the quarter and for the full year credit metrics remain strong supported by the premium nature of our customer base our exceptional risk management capabilities and the thoughtful risk actions weve taken through the year looking ahead to and beyond let me tell you why these results increase my confidence that were positioned to deliver on our growth plan aspirations first were in a great business we operate in the most attractive segments and geographies of the fastgrowing payment space as highlighted by our leadership positions with premium consumers including millennials and gen zers small and mediumsized businesses as well as serving the largest corporations in the world we bring to this space a number of advantages that are very difficult for our competitors to replicate these include our brand our unique membership model a premium global customer base and an integrated payments model forming the foundation of these advantages is our talented dedicated colleagues who deliver unparalleled service to our customers together the marketplace opportunities we see and the competitive advantages we can leverage create a long runway for growth we intend to capture these opportunities and build in our momentum by continuing to invest at high levels in several key areas continuously innovating our consumer and sme products refining our powerful marketing and risk management engines and capturing our fair share of lending growing merchant acceptance with a particular focus outside the us and expanding partnerships to drive customer value across the enterprise continuing to introduce new digital capabilities that deliver seamless intuitive customer experiences in their channels of choice and expanding into adjacencies that reinforce our core such as new lifestyle and financial services for consumers and smes which adds more value to our membership model all this investment happens while continually focused on gaining efficiencies in our marketing and operating expenses as weve demonstrated consistently over the past two years executing this investment strategy builds scale which fuels a virtuous cycle of growth that starts with the high spending highlyengaged premium customer base these premium customers attract a growing network of merchants and partners who add more value to our membership model which in turn enables us to attract more premium customers who attract more merchants and partners which creates more scale this scale enables us to generate more investment and operating efficiencies in our membership model making it more difficult for our competitors to catch up american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 so what does this mean for our plan for this year is built on continuing our investment strategy in the areas i mentioned while factoring in the blue chip economic consensus for slowing macroeconomic growth and as always we have plans in place to pivot should the economic environment change dramatically this translates into guidance consistent with what we originally laid out in our growth plan last year specifically we expect revenue growth of to which is higher than our longterm growth plan aspirations and eps of to in addition we plan to increase our quarterly dividend on common shares outstanding to a share up from beginning with the first quarter dividend declaration to sum up our performance shows that our strategy is working and based on our performance todate and what we see for im even more confident in our ability to achieve our aspirations for doubledigit annual revenue growth and midteens eps growth in and beyond ill now turn it over to jeff to provide more detail about our performance as always well have a qa session after jeffs remarks jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about our results which reflect steady progress against our multiyear growth plan that we announced last january and also to talk about what our results mean for ill also spend some of our time this morning focusing on our full year trends since it is yearend and since looking at our business on an annual basis is more in sync with how we actually run the company starting with our summary of financials on slide full year revenues reached an alltime high of billion up on an fxadjusted basis notably our fourth quarter revenues of billion also reached a record high for the third straight quarter improving on an fxadjusted basis this revenue momentum drove reported full year net income of billion and earnings per share of for the quarter we reported net income of billion and earnings per share of which did include a million impact from our net losses in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio as ive said throughout the year yearoveryear comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the sizable credit reserve releases we had in because of these prioryear reserve releases we have also included pretax preprovision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter on this basis pretax preprovision income was billion for the full year and billion in the fourth quarter up and respectively versus the prior year reflecting the growth momentum in our underlying earnings so now lets get into a more detailed look at our results beginning with volumes starting on slide we saw good quarteroverquarter growth in volumes i would note that we reached record levels of spending on our network in both the fourth quarter and full year total network volumes and billed business were up and year overyear in the fourth quarter and and for the full year on an fxadjusted basis now of course growth rates for quarters earlier in the year included more of a recovery on the lower levels of volumes in and we are now to the point where we have lapped the majority of this recovery we are pleased with this growth and the fact that it is being driven across customer types and geographies american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 on slides through weve given you a variety of views across our us consumer services commercial services and international card services segments and the various customer types within each theres a few key points i suggest you take away from these various perspectives starting with our largest segment us consumer billings grew in the fourth quarter reflecting the continued strength in spending trends from our premium us consumers our focus on attracting engaging and retaining younger cohorts of card members through our value propositions drove the growth in spending from our millennial and gen z customers on slide who you can now see make up of spend within the segment turning to commercial services you see that spending from our us small and mediumsize enterprise customers represents the majority of our billings in the segments supported by our strategic focus on expanding our range of products to help our sme clients run their businesses we saw another quarter of solid growth in us sme though you can see that it was the slowestgrowing customer type this quarter up yearoveryear as you heard steve talk about a bit last month at an investor conference our smes have recently started to slow down spending in several categories such as digital advertising so we continue to monitor spending trends moving to our us large and global corporate customers the one small customer type that has not come back to prepandemic spend levels they did continue though their steady recovery this quarter with overall billings now below prepandemic levels and lastly you see our highest growth in international card services as this segment is now in a steep recovery mode given it started its pandemic recovery later than other segments spending from international consumer and international sme and large corporate customers grew and yearoveryear respectively in q4 across all customer types te spending momentum remained particularly strong in the fourth quarter while we also saw nice sequential growth in the amount of goods services spending versus last quarter though there were a few pockets that slowed such as the digital advertising spend in sme that i mentioned earlier so what do all of these takeaways mean for at this point on a dollar basis most of our spending categories have fully recovered so i would expect more stable growth rates this year across spending categories with the exception that yearoveryear growth rates for te spending will likely be elevated in q1 as we lap the impact of omicron from the prior year importantly all of the things that steve just talked about that make up the strategy underlying our growth plan have created a foundation for sustainable growth rates greater than what we were seeing prepandemic now moving on to loans and card member receivables on slide we saw yearoveryear growth of in our loan balances as well as good sequential growth this loan growth is now exceeding our spend growth as customers steadily rebuild their balances given the volumes of course have now lapped their steep phase of recovery we do expect the growth rate of our loan balances to moderate as we progress through but to remain elevated versus prepandemic levels the interestbearing portion of our loan balances which surpassed levels last quarter also continues to consistently rebuild with over of yearoveryear growth in the us coming from our existing customers which is about percentage points more than what we saw in the years leading up to the pandemic american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 as you then turn to credit and provision on slide through the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our strong credit performance card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remain below prepandemic levels so they did continue to tick up this quarter as we expected which you can see on slide going forward we expect delinquency and writeoff rates to continue to move up over time but to remain below prepandemic levels in for card member loans turning now to the accounting for this credit performance on slide since it is year end and because the pandemic has clearly impacted the timing of quarterly reserve build and release adjustments across the industry i think its helpful to look at our full year provision results full year provision expense was billion which included a million reserve build primarily driven by loan growth the continued steady and expected increase in delinquency rates and changes in the macroeconomic outlook as the year progressed the billion number is of course still unusually low by historical standards relative to the size of our loan balances and card member receivables of the full year million reserve build we saw million of it in the fourth quarter since earlier this year we were still releasing a significant amount of the credit reserves we had built to capture the uncertainty of the pandemic at this point we no longer have any of these pandemicdriven reserves remaining on our balance sheet moving to reserves on slide you can see that we ended with billion of reserves representing of our total loans in card member receivables this reserve rate is about basis points below the levels we had prepandemic or day one cecl reflecting the continued premiumization of our portfolio and the strong credit performance we have seen we view this consolidated reserve rate as more comparable to day one cecl than the individual loans and receivables rates because as we talked a bit last quarter our charge products in many instances now have some embedded lending functionality we expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through but to remain below prepandemic levels taking all of this into account in you should expect to see provision expense move back towards more of a steadystate relative to the size of our loan balances and card member receivables for the first time since we adopted cecl in early given the combination of our strong loan growth and unusually low level by historical standards of provision expense in i would expect a significant yearoveryear increase in provision expense moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the fourth quarter and up for the full year this is well above our original expectations driven by the successful execution of our strategy and is part of what strengthens our confidence in our longterm aspirations before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that you see a 200basispoint spread between our fxadjusted revenue growth and reported revenue growth for this quarter while this is less of an impact from the strong dollar than what we saw in the prior quarter it does remain a modest headwind our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in q4 and for the full year on an fx adjusted basis as you can see on slide this growth is primarily driven by the momentum seen in our spending american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 volumes throughout net card fee revenues continued to accelerate throughout this year up yearover year in the fourth quarter and for the full year on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide in i expect net card fees to be our fastestgrowing revenue line but i would expect growth to moderate from the extremely high level we saw this quarter this steady growth is powered by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our feepaying products due to the investments weve made in our premium value propositions as steve discussed earlier with acquisitions of us consumer platinum and gold card members and us business platinum card members all reaching record highs in moving on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear in q4 and for the year on an fxadjusted basis due to the recovery of our revolving loan balances the rising interest rate environment has had a fairly neutral impact on our results in as deposit betas lagged the rapid and steep benchmark rate increases during the year however when you think about deposit betas are now in line with more historical levels so i would expect the yearoveryear impact from rising rates to represent more of a headwind in to sum up on revenues were seeing strong results across the board and really good momentum looking forward into we expect to see revenue growth of to now all this revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments weve made and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement expenses these costs as you see on slide came in at total revenues for the fourth quarter and for the full year based off the q4 exit rate combined with our continued focus on investing to innovate our products id expect variable customer engagement costs to approach of total revenues in on the marketing line we invested around billion in the fourth quarter and billion for the full year as a reminder our marketing dollars mostly represent the things we do to directly drive the great customer acquisition results we are seeing as we look forward we remain focused on driving efficiencies so that our marketing dollars grow far slower than revenues as we did for many years prior to the pandemic as a result in we expect to have marketing spend that is fairly flat to moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the fourth quarter and billion for full year in understanding our opex results its important to note the net marktomarket impact to our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio that i mentioned earlier with reference to q4 these gains and losses are reported in the opex line and totaled million in losses for full year while in the prior year we had a million benefit in net gains even putting this aside as steve and i have discussed all year our operating expenses do represent a stepfunction increase compared to prior years as we have invested in key underpinnings to support our revenue growth and as inflation has had some impact on our expenses moving forward similar to marketing we are focused on gaining efficiencies and getting back to the low levels of growth in opex that we have historically seen for we expect operating expenses to be around billion and see these cost as a key source of leverage relative to the high level of revenue growth in our growth plan last our effective tax rate for full year was around our best estimate of the effective tax rate in is between to absent any legislative changes american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 turning next to capital on slide we returned billion in capital to our shareholders in including billion in the fourth quarter with million of common stock repurchases and million in common stock dividends all on the back of strong earnings generation we ended the year with our cet1 ratio at within our target range of to in q1 as steve discussed we do expect to increase our dividend by to per quarter consistent with our approach of growing our dividend in line with earnings and our to target payout ratio well continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth going forward that then brings me to our growth plan and guidance on slide was a strong year where we exceeded our full year guidance that we laid out in our growth plan last january for both revenues and eps these results have strengthened our confidence in our guidance first and most importantly we expect the strategies that steve laid out earlier to deliver continued high levels of revenue growth leading to our revenue growth guidance for of to and setting us up well for and beyond as you think about the drivers of eps growth in first we expect to return to the low levels of growth we have historically driven in our marketing and operating expenses producing some nice leverage going the other direction the two notable headwinds that should be just challenges are around the year overyear impacts of provision and of interest rates as i discussed earlier combining all of these factors together leads to our eps guidance of to for there is clearly uncertainty as it relates to the macroeconomic environment but as steve discussed our guidance factors in the blue chip macroeconomic consensus which is for slowing growth though not a significant recession id also say that our guidance is based on what we are actually seeing in terms of behaviors from our customers around the globe and of course it reflects what we know today about the regulatory and competitive environment we feel good about the momentum we see in our business and in any environment remain committed to running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of sustainably delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth in and beyond as we get to a more steadystate macro environment and with that ill turn the call back over to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri s bernstein senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question is coming from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning ryan jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so steve maybe just to focus on the revenue growth obviously to is much better than the market was expecting given macro concerns and theres obviously been a little bit of an uptick in white collar unemployment so could you maybe just talk highlevel about how youre able to put up this type of revenue growth in a somewhat weakening environment maybe just talk through some of the things that are idiosyncratic to amex that jeff just referenced at the end of the call that maybe the market isnt appreciating that should be big drivers of revenue growth in the year ahead thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think jeff really hit it i mean what he basically said was and this is where we what were focused on is we can only run the business and forecast the business on what were seeing and what were seeing is were still seeing high consumer growth were seeing high consumer growth in international we talked about some moderation in small business corporate spending still has not come back jeff talked about te but i think when you think about the model i think what you have to get an appreciation for is were a small segment of the overall us population and its a premium customer base and that premium customer base while not immune to economic downturn certainly right now is spending on through and so the other thing that weve been doing is were constantly tightening up the card members that were acquiring i mean look the card member base we have today is from a credit perspective better than the card member base that we had prepandemic and card members were acquiring today are reaching a higher hurdle rate than ones we acquired just a year ago and because of the value theres still a good pool of customers that are out there as far as overall white collar unemployment what i would say is yeah youve seen some headlines of individual companies that are going through layoffs but the one thing that i would say is i think its really important to look at where these companies were prepandemic and theyre probably still at employment levels that are much higher american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 than what they were prepandemic and so theres a rightsizing a little bit but even with that rightsizing we still have unemployment rates under and so look we look at unemployment but it has not at this particular point in time had any impact on our card member base i mean again keeping our writeoffs at and is sort of not sustainable and were at as jeff said it shows on the slides and that will tick up a little bit over time but thats just normal for the business so i think what you have to really look at is this is a premium card member base that appreciates premium products and is spending and it is a small piece of the overall us economy and weve talked about the economy being bifurcated and theres probably no better example of what we have here the other thing that i would say when you think about revenue growth unlike our competitors we have a three legged revenue stool here right youve got fees that we get from merchants you have card fees now card fees were growth in the fourth quarter and while thats a high number we certainly expect doubledigit card fee growth to continue and then you have obviously which is a smaller portion of our business we have obviously interest revenue as well so when we look at the card members were acquiring were really looking at acquiring revenue across those three components and the other thing that id point you to is of the cards that we acquire are paying fees so thats how we come up with to operator thank you the next question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning sanjay sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i guess i had a revenue question as well jeff could you maybe just disaggregate the building blocks of the revenue growth i know you mentioned a couple of things in terms of the trends on fees and nii im just looking at discount revenue and the yearoveryear change in growth and that sort of decelerated a little bit more than i had anticipated i guess does that slow down maybe some help there would be helpful jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah i think sanjay the building blocks are pretty straightforward and of course as steve just pointed out in our model you always have to start expanding right because thats what drives our model not lending and i think probably the important words that i would pick out of some of the things steve and i have just said is for most of our spending categories if you think about whats important in terms of dollars we really have hit a recovery point and so as we look at the q4 rates i actually see those exit rates is approaching pretty stable levels for what we think given the tremendous success were having in bringing new customers into the franchise because as you know sanjay that is a key aspect of what drives our growth i actually see those rates being fairly stable going forward so thats what drives first really strong discount revenue growth our card fee growth as steve just mentioned is super sustainable id just remind everyone that american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 is the one line item that grew double digits right through all the ups and downs of the pandemic and gosh our latest figures that steve just gave you of our card members on feepaying products this quarter we have a long ways to go to keep growing net card fees and then look its the third leg of the stool its only of our revenues but net interest income matters and we are still in a rebuilding mode of balances certainly that process has now begun in earnest and thats why you saw our loans grow a little faster than volumes this quarter so i dont expect to see quite as high a rate next year as you saw in q4 but its still above in i would say the stable level and so above where we were prepandemic because of that rebuilding process so you put all that together with the comments that youve now heard both steve and i make which is look we got to run the business based on what we see with our customers who are premium consumers select segments of small businesses and the large companies in the world and thats where you get to the to revenue growth operator thank you the next question is coming from betsy graseck of morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so another kind of subtext on this theme i wanted to understand a little bit about how i should be triangulating the revenue growth outlook which is very clear with the comments around normalization of credit should i be expecting that youre underwriting to that prepandemic level of was it on the slide with marketing spend being flat and the proprietary net acquired accounts here coming down a little bit in the quarter so when i see all that im thinking that your bubble of account acquisitions is through i suppose and you dont need that marketing dollars to drive that incremental rev growth at the same time as youre underwriting to a group a credit pool thats similar to prepandemic so we should have that nco trajectory move back up towards prepandemic or is there something that im missing in pulling that all together thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well ill theres a lot there but let me try and talk about marketing and jeff can pick up on other components but so look the billion of marketing spend was alltime record high and the million cards that we acquired the fact that you saw a card decrease sort of sequentially quarteroverquarter is not something that were concerned about at all and some of that can be timing of when you do your acquisition and so forth and so but the key point here is that were all looking at marketing efficiencies and we continuously raise the bar on who we are bringing into the franchise so were not i wouldnt say were at a bubble in terms of card acquisition we dont project card acquisition we provide the card acquisition numbers but for us and american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 probably we need to do a better job going forward from a metrics perspective but we really look at revenue i mean we look at the cards that we acquire in terms of how much revenue we can acquire its the same thing with billings i mean not all billings are created equal i mean theres billings that you have that dont have a lot of value to it within the industry we look at profitable billings we look at card fees and we look at that as jeff said interest income so i wouldnt take away from this that were at an inflection point or a bubble or anything like that i think the billion is a tremendous amount of money to go out there and acquire with and were pushing the organization to even be more efficient and more effective with that money so were looking at the same kind of acquisition levels that weve had in the past with higher underwriting standards as well as far as operating expenses go and as you start to think about that we had a big stepup in operating expenses as we had tremendous growth and having had a lot of experience running the components of this organization from both a technology perspective and an operating perspective travel and what have you as you see those volume increases you need to manage and get to that next level of scale and we believe that we have gotten to that next level of scale and well get back to normal operating expense growth and the other part of it just like everybody else look audio gap increased there was some inflationary pressure within there but make no mistake about it there was we had to get to another scale when you have revenue growth when you have billings growth when you have travel bookings that are at all times highs and continuing to increase quarteroverquarter you have to put in place not only the digital capabilities but the people to make sure that you can handle all that so from an expense perspective the reason were able to say that we think marketing will be where it is and operating expenses will not grow at the same level that they will is because we believe weve gotten to that scale component that we now believe that we can grow revenues to get into a growth mode 10plus growth mode and beyond with that scale until a point in time and i dont know when that is where we have to have another scale jump but what you saw from a growth perspective last year was all about the scale so jeff do you want to talk about credit or anything else or jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co no i think you got it stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co all right so thats how we think about that in terms of going below sort of the components of revenue and how expenses relate to that revenue operator thank you the next question is coming from mark devries of barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thank you sorry if i missed this but can you talk about how sensitive your revenue guidance is to the macro kind of what gets you to the high and low end of the range you provided and are you using at all the same assumptions around gdp and unemployment that you used to kind of set the reserve levels jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 mark one of the interesting things that i think surprises people is we have looked historically every way you can imagine trying to find really direct correlations between gdp growth and for that matter between movements in the markets that affect peoples financial wealth and the i think surprising thing to many people is we cant find any direct correlation between those two things so when you look at our to guidance its really id go back to what steve and i have both now said a couple times driven by our best indicator is what we see with our customers around the globe and how theyre behaving and we certainly are aware of and think about various macroeconomic forecasts but you start with what behaviors are we actually seeing and id also remind everyone that the us remains by far our largest market the us economy shrank in the first two quarters of and we just posted revenue growth for the full year so when i think about the to range its really not oh well is a weaker economy frankly its i wish we were more precise about forecasting but its just a little bit of forecast error i would say based on the trends weve seen and the macroeconomic consensus which is absolutely the economy is supposed to slow when you look at that consensus and thats factored in here as well operator thank you the next question is coming from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi mihir mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc i think you said good morning i think you said of existing loan lending growth came from existing members is there a similar metric you can share on the spending side just trying to understand as things normalize and we get into more of a normal cadence how maybe help us project a little bit on spending growth how that can translate as we look at your last few quarters of strong acquisitions thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well so what id say is that when you look at lending i am going to go back to that number because i do think its an important one to think about the implications i think occasionally people look at our loan growth and say oh is that all the new customers youre acquiring and what do you know about them and so we actually draw a lot of comfort from the fact that you have of that loan growth coming from just our existing customers who we know well we have history with really just rebuilding more towards historical levels if you think about spending in our model we talk a lot about the fact that we have i think by the standards of most industries remarkably higher retention rates in the high90 well range and thats a real key strength of our model once we get someone into the franchise they tend to stay that group depending on the economy is growing organically a little bit when you think about adding our new customers that is a key engine at any point in time of adding another a normal environment and it varies over time but i might anchor you around an to kind of number so its a mixture of superlow retention what were doing to spur more spending by our existing customers and that steady flow of new customers and so one of the things again that steve and i have american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 both just talked about because i think people seem a little surprised steve by the to is a key driver of why were comfortable with that is our tremendous success over the last year and in the first weeks of at bringing great new customers into the franchise stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and the other thing i would say is and i said this in my remarks this virtuous cycle that we talk about the more card members we bring in the more merchant and partner offers that we can get and so the engagement the increased engagement from existing cardholders is a really important driver of growth so that the membership model is we just dont bring our card members in and sort of watch them hope they grow we bring our card members in and we want to work with them to grow we do that from a small business perspective with our account development teams making sure that theyre taking advantage of all the benefits of the card making sure that theyre spending in categories that they can spend in maximizing rewards and so forth and we do that with our card base from an offer perspective through amex offers through other direct offers from partners embedded offers within the model and so a lot of our engagement not only from a customer service perspective is to making sure that our card members are taking advantage of all the aspects of the card that are out there and so we really look to grow samestore sales right i mean so from existing card members were constantly looking to grow that share of their wallet and again that gets easier as the cycle gets bigger because more and more merchants want to reach more and more of our card members operator thank you the next question is coming from brian foran of autonomous research please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research us lp hi obviously a very positive outlook i dont want to sound negative but i think what were all kind of dealing with is investors being like this is great ill take it but help me think about what are the risks where could it go wrong so maybe one question and one followup along the same theme jeff when you were talking about the macro sensitivity one question i hear sometimes is the note that the aspirational and beyond is a steadystate macro and i get the investor question like wheres the dividing line like what would a nonsteadystate macro look like where that guidance would then or aspiration would then not apply so maybe you could touch on that like what are the bounds in your mind for a steadystate macro jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well i think brian i would start with two comments first when you think about our longterm aspirations we dont actually worry about recessions at all because the reality is at some point and i dont know if its six months from now or six years there will be a recession and after that recession there will be a recovery and it doesnt change our view of we should be able to steadily grow this company in excess of now when theres a recession where you see a very significant shrinkage in gdp so not like the first half of last year where maybe the us gdp went down point or something but where you suddenly see a quarter or two american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 where you have pandemiclike or great financial crisislike large percentage declines in gdp and you see huge spikes in unemployment if you go back to one of the appendix slides you will see that our cecl credit reserve accounting assumes a baseline and also builds in a downside scenario in that downside scenario you have unemployment by the third quarter well if theres unemployment by the third quarter of were going to have a few quarters where were probably below our longerterm aspirations but its that kind of large shock thats going to knock us off for a few quarters but i really want to keep coming back to and i suspect steve you might reinforce this that it doesnt change our longterm aspirations or how were going to run the company stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co no and i think just go back to the pandemic so look we pulled back on acquiring card members because i dont think anybody had any line of sight i mean the pandemic was worse than the financial crisis from a credit underwriting perspective you never say never but thats sort of like the 100year flood right and so my perspective is well still acquire in that kind of scenario and remember everything we acquired today we acquired through the cycle but what we would do is move the credit criteria even further up but what we would do again is we would engage with our card members i think one of the most successful things that we did during the pandemic was retaining cardholders retaining those cardholders ph but it was through financial relief programs that got them through the hump for a couple of months for six months whatever it was or engaging them to spend in other areas and to stick with us so the reality is is that if we were running this business quartertoquarter which we dont you would pull back but the reality is as jeff said after every recession theres a recovery and the last thing you want to do is retrench in such a way that youre not going to be able to take advantage of the recovery and that retrenchment looks like layoffs that dont make sense and pulling back on marketing and trying to hit an eps number for a quarter or for a year that is irrelevant whats relevant is for 172year old company to continue to grow over the medium and long term and the way you do that is you invest judiciously and you invest smartly and in times when things are bad you invest in your infrastructure you invest in your people because youre going to need great people through when a recession is over and your infrastructure is going to need to do that and where companies make mistakes is let go of great people and also do not invest in those things that are going to need six to nine months from now when the recession is over so yeah we may have a moment in time as jeff said it could be six months it could be six years but there will be a time when we dont make that and but there will be a time when we exceed that and thats why we say our longterm aspiration is for 10plus growth in revenue and we feel were on our way to that operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my question look when we look at slide its really interesting in terms of the contribution and the significant growth from millennials and gen z you guys have been really successful there and weve seen that progress over time im curious given that the millennial gen z growth in the last year was basically american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 to other cohorts and the significant loan growth if we looked at this distribution by age cohort not for billed business but by portfolio in terms of borrowings what the distribution would it look like would millennials over index versus the peers jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well the short answer rick is no when you think about the behavior of the millennials and gen zs there are a few distinguishing features and we talked about these they tend to be more digitally engaged they tend to be more engaged with the overall value proposition which we actually see as a good thing because of that they often will engage more quickly when they get a new product but id also remind you of the other stat weve talked about this morning which is of our growth in loans right now is coming from existing customers so as we add a lot of these millennials there that segment is still not adding as much to the loan growth because of the rebuild imbalances by your existing customers so while the behaviors of the younger card members are on average similar to the older card members when you think about borrowing just sort of the math here because youve got this rebuilding effect which say that theyre not driving that big a portion of our loan growth stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and we tend to get a higher share of their wallet but they do have lower spending and the great part about millennials and gen zs is that theyre and depending on where you are millennial i mean some millennials are now so i mean theyre in a different thing but the reality is the lifetime value of these cardholders is going to be significantly more than the lifetime value of acquiring a boomer or acquiring a gen xer right now and thats very attractive as well and if you look again rick on page youll see that look its of the billed business growth on the other hand boomer growth is only and some of those have been leery to go back traveling still so wed also expect that to go up operator thank you the next question is coming from dominick gabriele of oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hey good morning jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey dominic dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc these are great results good morning i just want to change the topic a little bit i just wanted your updated thoughts if you could just remind everybody about your ability to make accountbyaccount purchase limit authorization decisions given many of the accounts dont actually have stated line sizes on the charge cards so im just really wondering about severity of loss in a downturn versus the frequency is more based on unemployment but your ability to really hone in on limiting the severity of loss given your underwriting techniques thanks so much guys american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co i mean i think you just reminded us the reality is a couple things right number one we constantly go through and look at contingent liability thats not being utilized and so if we have somebody that has x for a line and theyre only using of x we may not keep x there that long because we dont want to be a lender of last resort right thats number one number two we also are for new card members were raising those cycles but raising the limit the hurdle rate that we acquire card members but we underwrite every transaction we make a credit decision not based on the line because most of our card members do not have a line i mean obviously traditional lending cards have lines but other than that we are underwriting every single transaction so were not letting somebody just run it up because theyve run it up in the past and were not letting somebody run up to a limit and then have that write off one of the advantages of our model and im not going to get into all of the variables underneath for a couple of reasons number one we dont have time and number two its very complicated and number three i probably dont fully all understand the whole thing either but it is a an advantage of this model is that every single transaction is adjudicated on its own merits its not adjudicated based on an opentobuy and that is very important it also but thats from a credit perspective thats a really reassuring thing but from a spending perspective it also enables why you read some of these stories of hey i just bought a painting for million theres nobody that has a million line right now those are very difficult underwriting decisions and not for the faint of heart but it does show that we make those same kind of decisions on a purchase on a purchase every single transaction that comes through this system is adjudicated on its own merits not on sort of some opento buy and that gives us great comfort in terms of not having somebody just run something up and then have something written off jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah the only thing id add i think that is a unique capability we have honed over many decades since we first started the charge card product the other advantage of a charge card product i would say dominick is it does give us this population who is supposed to pay us in full every days which actually is almost like an early warning system from an overall risk management perspective of when there are problems that pop up in various parts of the world or various segments or various customer types and we think thats actually helpful to our overall results and its part of the many things that drives us historically and today that have by far bestinclass credit metrics operator thank you the next question is coming from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great sorry to go back to the revenue guide but jeff and i appreciate the revenue growth for the full year but the quarter was and between you and steve you both said that there was going to be a slowdown still strong obviously but a slowdown in card fee revenue growth and with that the comments about margin probably net interest income so i guess is there a part of the revenue base that you think is accelerating in american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well so two comments its a good callout moshe the first comment is as you think about of course the base year here you saw things progressively pick up as you went through the year so thats why each quarter our volumes on a yearoveryear basis have slowed a little bit but we also have pointed out that i think just sort of through that recovery period now so i think what you see in q4 in our view is very typical of what youre going to get now the one exception that we do think will accelerate is the net interest income piece because you do have customers continuing to rebuild balances so net card fees probably moderates a little bit net interest income probably accelerates a little bit but your discount revenue should be pretty consistent with what you have seen in this quarter and thats really the model that leads you from q4 to what we expect for operator thank you the next question is coming from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc yeah thank you maybe some topics that hasnt been touched on yet and steve you called out investment in services and adjacencies id say and also the international piece expanding your merchant acceptance there so just any callouts on adjacencies the b2b payments and your how that contributes to your longterm strategy and then international i seem to recall japan being an important market for you saw some good growth internationally japan reopened china is reopening is there acceleration potential in international in stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so let me hit a couple of these topics and hopefully ill remember them all that you went through but look i think international weve seen really good and just look at the slides youve seen really good growth from not only a consumer perspective which is over but international sme and large corporations are growing at so and remember prepandemic those are the fastestgrowing parts of our business so we expect that to continue to grow which obviously japan is part of it and one of our top markets from an acceptance perspective we continue to grow acceptance internationally were really happy with the coverage gains that weve had and well continue to focus on that weve talked about focusing on priority cities we focused on all the categories ecommerce and restaurants and lodging and tourist attractions airlines hotel and so forth to get those up but again with that were getting and billings growth and our coverage is not where we want it to be yet and we will continue to invest in that coverage look as far as b2b goes b2b continues to be a good story for us but its just a small part its a smaller part of the business and we continue to invest in capabilities and well continue to focus on b2b but that will add not only to commercial spending but that will also add to small business spending as well and remember of the small business spending that we have is in the category of b2b spending and so well continue to hunt for that and try and automate more and more of those billings and it makes it easier to get on the card operator thank you the next question will be coming from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi steve just curious if youve seen anything that sort of raised your concern level around competition in us consumer or small business i mean it seems to us like you might be pulling away a little bit from competitors im not sure if your metrics suggest that or not stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i mean look i dont we continually look to raise the bar and i think that theres a lot of great competitors out there weve got jpmorgan and bank of america and wells fargo and us bank and capital one and everybody is theyre all strong and they i mean they all had pretty strong results from a growth perspective but as i said in my remarks the more value we continue to add the more we get our flywheel working the harder it is to catch up and were not resting on our laurels and thats why we continue to invest we continue to invest in value propositions we continue to invest in capabilities we continue to invest in service and so are we increasing the distance between us and our competitors i dont know how you measure that but i think our goal is to constantly make it hard for them to catch up and our goal is to make sure that were trying to be one step two steps or three steps ahead of them and its flattering actually that theyre coming after the segments that were in and but competition is there and it is fierce and for us competition is just not us consumer its small business its corporate its in international and so were fighting a lot of battles here in terms of defending our territory but i think the team is doing a really really good job but were never going to rest and if in fact they stopped wed still keep going so it is really important i think its one of the things that we decided a number of years ago that we would constantly refresh our products on a very regular basis and add value on an interim basis which youve seen with our platinum card and our other products and i think thats really helped us out quite a bit operator thank you our final question will come from lisa ellis of moffettnathanson please go ahead lisa ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc terrific thank you thanks for squeezing me in i had a question about international the billed business growth in international really caught my eye because that figure is more than of what visa and mastercards international credit growth was in the fourth quarters and so i was hoping to just dig in a little bit so into what looking at your international business is driving that and how sustainable it is it looks like its mostly driven by spending per card the card growth isnt unusually high so is there a im trying to understand is this a significant share gain going on is this acceptance that youre driving is this something unique about the geographic composition of the customer base can you just dig into that a little bit indiscernible thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so lisa i think its a look prepandemic we were pretty close to anyway from an international perspective and look its a smaller base than visa mastercard and its a really high premium customer segment and its a segment that travels its a card base that travels quite a bit so prepandemic we were american express co axp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2023 growing in that range and that growth was due to a real focus on value proposition and a focus on merchant acceptance i think what youre seeing right now which is growth which is slightly outsized growth is still recovery from the pandemic right i mean if you think about it this growth quarteroverquarter you still had a lot of lockdowns people were not traveling last year at this time in international and so look our goal is to our hope is to continue to grow this business as it was prepandemic at around that level but from my perspective theres really nothing unusual here were sticking to our strategy enhancing the value continuing to add merchant acceptance and continuing to invest in this segment these two segments of small business and international consumer card which were fast growing prepandemic so nothing really unusual and it probably normalized a little bit as the year goes on because people were getting out there and traveling and we got into the second and third quarters kerri s bernstein senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co with that we will
