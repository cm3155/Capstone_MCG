into the results fullyear adjusted eps of core rotce of and revenues of billion reflected our ability to deliver solid financial results while continuing to position for earnings growth over the years ahead nim of was impacted by the rapid tightening weve seen over the past two years with the tightening cycle likely behind us we are well positioned for meaningful nim expansion going forward there are a few notable items in the quarter i wanted to touch on before diving into operational results this morning we announced that weve reached an agreement to sell ally lending this transaction allows us to allocate capital to our highest returning businesses and focus on strengthening relationships with our consumer and dealer customers the operations were moved to held for sale and we recorded a goodwill impairment within the quarter the fourth quarter impacts which russ will cover in more detail are excluded from adjusted eps we expect the sale to close in the first quarter and generate basis points of cet1 at closing and modestly increased tangible book value the sale is also accretive to earnings going forward additionally within the quarter we deconsolidated billion of retail auto loans from the balance sheet through securitization transactions adding basis points of cet1 from a cost perspective the benefit of the head count actions we announced in the third quarter and completed in the fourth quarter are fully embedded in our expense run rate going forward fourth quarter results also include a million fdic special assessment being incurred across the industry our charge was among the lowest in the industry reflecting the composition of our deposit base the impact of the assessment is also excluded from adjusted eps moving to fullyear operational highlights within auto finance consumer originations of billion were sourced from a record million applications a testament to the scale of our business and mutually beneficial dealer relationships the average originated yield of increased nearly basis points on a fullyear basis driven by robust application flow disciplined pricing and underwriting importantly nearly of our fullyear volume was in our highest quality credit tier which will be a tailwind to the loss profile as those loans season fullyear net chargeoffs in retail auto were basis points in line with the guidance we gave a year ago we continue to see encouraging performance trends across vintages and flowtoloss rates which well cover when we get the credit shortly insurance earned premiums of billion were the highest since our ipo now turning to ally bank was an outstanding year in terms of deposits performance despite the disruption stemming from the march banking events and the decline in deposit balances across much of the industry we delivered solid deposit growth every quarter in we also saw record growth in customers and now serve more than million customers with billion of deposit balances ally credit card now serves more than million active cardholders with billion of balances despite elevated net chargeoff activity in the near term returns in the card business are compelling which well cover in more detail shortly and finally corporate finance continues to generate steady loan growth and accretive returns the business delivered record earnings and a roe in and the quality of the book remains strong ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 lets turn to slide number to talk about allys marketleading franchises within dealer financial services dealer relationships resulted in nearly million consumer auto applications in a record for ally in terms of originations thats more than billion sic billion in consumer auto volume decisions which allows us to be selective and optimize returns again billion of insurance earned premiums is the highest since our ipo and we see a long runway ahead as we leverage synergies with our auto finance team i mentioned the impressive scale and growth weve seen in the consumer bank on the previous slide but were equally pleased with the quality of our customer base ally bank depositors are highly engaged with more than million consumers leveraging core product features across deposits and ally invest that engagement continues to drive customer retention that has stayed above since we launched the bank in both dealer financial services and ally bank have a robust scale but remain nimble and able to pivot in response to evolving market dynamics that has served us well in this environment and gives me confidence in our ability to deliver earnings growth going forward turning to slide number total revenue of billion represents a increase since net financing revenue of billion is up through the strategic positioning of the auto finance business and the consistent growth in highquality deposits and other revenue is up more than as weve grown feegenerating businesses like insurance smartauction and our auto passthrough programs at the bottom of the page we highlight our revenue growth across insurance corporate finance and credit card revenue from these businesses have nearly doubled over the last nine years and we see opportunities for further growth going forward on slide number you can clearly see weve driven substantial higher margin through transformation on both sides of the balance sheet despite facing pressure from the historic rise in shortterm rates nim is up basis points since and is more than basis points higher than where we were just a few years ago looking ahead we see our retail auto yield continuing to expand as we originate new loans at higher yields than our current portfolio disciplined growth in higher yielding corporate finance and credit card loans coupled with the continued decline in lower yielding mortgage and securities are also a tailwind to earning asset yields our asset yield momentum is unique in the industry and combined with our strong deposit franchise supports our confidence in our attractive nim trajectory on slide number weve again provided a snapshot of our funding stack and liquidity position were core funded with deposits making up of our profile and have multiple efficient funding sources including unsecured secured and shortterm vehicles like the fhlb total available liquidity is billion is times our uninsured deposit balances our conservative liquidity profile remains a key priority and source of strength for ally deposits remain at the core of our funding position and the performance we saw in against a very challenging market backdrop highlighted the unique strength of our consumer bank lets turn to slide number as we said many times before we are committed to optimization across our businesses to generate capital drive riskadjusted returns and invest in our scaled franchises we took several meaningful actions in the quarter that demonstrate our commitment the pending sale of ally lending allows us to further prioritize our highest returning and scaled businesses that directly serve our auto and deposit customers at closing we expect the sale of ally lending to add basis points to our cet1 ratio and modestly increase tangible book value the transaction is also accretive to earnings going forward ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 during the quarter we sold billion of retail auto loans via the securitization market to free up capital that can be redeployed to further support our dealers and consumers we sold seasoned loans that were originated in a lower yield environment at breakeven economics demonstrating market appetite for our loans we will continue to look opportunistically at ways to sell loans to create capital and better serve our dealers and consumers in addition we will continue to progress initiatives that we started over the past 12plus months to generate capital and optimize returns we meaningfully curtailed our origination appetite with a focus on eliminating underperforming segments particularly within auto and card the head count actions we took in and completed during the fourth quarter have reduced the cost base of the company well see the full million benefit in tax actions in also added million of capital weve not reinvested in the securities portfolio and has put minimal more volume on the balance sheet since in this quarter we moved billion of nonagency mbs from afs to htm reducing oci volatility the securities are a subset of our investment portfolio but do not qualify as contingent liquidity with changes to the regulatory framework on the horizon and the compelling origination opportunities we have within auto finance you should expect capital optimization efforts will remain a top priority for us moving forward and with that ill turn it over to russ to cover detailed financial results russell e hutchinson chief financial officer ally financial inc thank you jb good morning everyone ill begin on slide net financing revenue excluding oid of billion was down yearoveryear driven by higher funding costs given elevated shortterm rates strength in fixed asset pricing was a partial offset during the quarter and positions us for nim expansion through and beyond adjusted revenue of million was up yearover year and quarteroverquarter reflecting continued momentum across our diversified product offerings and solid investment gains were now at the quarterly run rate we previously guided to and expect continued expansion over time several years of strong conquest volume and normalization of dealer inventories create a nice tailwind for insurance revenue and we continue to see growth in both smartauction and the consumer auto passthrough programs which enable us to better monetize application flow provision expense of million reflected solid credit performance in retail auto with losses on the low end of our guidance and elevated losses in card as we highlighted at an investor conference last quarter provision expense also included a million benefit as we moved the ally lending assets to held for sale designation in anticipation of a sale this benefit has been excluded from adjusted metrics including earnings per share noninterest expense of billion includes two significant onetime items first a million writedown of goodwill associated with the ally lending sale that brings the ally lending related onetime items to million in total netting out the provision benefit and second we incurred a million charge from the fdi sic fdic special assessment associated with the banking crisis both items have been excluded from adjusted metrics including adjusted earnings per share excluding these onetime items expenses were up around on a yearoveryear basis right in the middle of the range we provided in december ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 our effective tax rate during the quarter was negative on a gaap basis excluding the impact of one day the tax rate was around which was better than expected as we saw strong ev volume during the quarter gaap and adjusted eps for the quarter were and respectively moving to slide net interest margin excluding oid of decreased basis points quarteroverquarter in line with the expectations and resulting in a fullyear nim of earning assets were down on a linked quarter basis driven mainly by the sale of billion of retail auto loans within the quarter margin has been pressured as we progressed through the tightening cycle given the liability sensitive nature of our balance sheet but we have performed well in terms of pricing on both sides of the balance sheet retail auto pricing has achieved the pricing beta and has exceeded expectations strong pricing has moved retail portfolio yields up basis points in the past year as weve talked about before we see that yield expanding as origination yields are well above looking forward we expect earning assets to be generally flat but with favorable mix dynamics as lower yielding mortgage and securities are running off and being replaced by higher returning retail auto corporate finance and credit card assets so on the asset side both mix and natural portfolio turnover within retail auto will be tailwinds in and beyond turning to liabilities cost of funds moved up within the quarter in line with expectations this tightening began weve seen a cumulative deposit beta of around which compares well to peers particularly in the context of billion of ally retail deposit growth and record customer growth in the year where industry balance is contracted we remain confident in our path to nim we have assumed the fed is done tightening but we are not dependent on fed cuts rate cuts will impact the pace of nim expansion but not the destination the pace of rate cuts implied by the current forward curve would accelerate our path to nim towards the middle of next year turning to page cet1 of increased quarteroverquarter as we mentioned before the sale of ally lending will add another basis points upon closing in march given we have another cecl phasein we expect a relatively flat cet1 ratio in the first quarter as the ally lending sale benefit will be offset by cecl phase in our tce to ta ratio increased by more than basis points within the quarter driven by an increase in oci as benchmark rates declined we recently announced our quarterly dividend of which remains flat to prior quarter as jb laid out capital actions we undertook during the quarter and actions that we continue to execute upon reflect our commitment to generating capital strategically investing in our highest returning businesses and driving longterm value shareholders tangible book value per share up since our ipo excluding the impacts of oci which we expect to accrete to par over time lets turn to slide to review asset quality trends consolidated net chargeoffs of basis points reflected seasonal trends and elevated activity within corporate finance and credit card retail auto net chargeoffs of basis points in the fourth quarter were at the low end of the guidance we provided on our third quarter earnings call in commercial auto we recognized chargeoffs of million which were previously reserved for resulting in minimal pl impact within the quarter ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 in the bottom right and 60day retail auto delinquencies reflect seasonal increases importantly the year overyear increase in 30day delinquency rates declined for the fourth consecutive quarter moving to slide consolidated coverage decreased basis points to the decrease within the quarter was mainly driven by mix dynamics including the pending sale of ally lending which carried a coverage rate of and growth within commercial auto which has a lower coverage rate given its low loss content the decline in coverage rate was also impacted by the recognition of losses on credits within corporate finance and commercial auto for which we previously had specific reserves that do not need to be replenished the total loan loss reserve of billion declined approximately million driven mainly by the movement of ally lending assets to held for sale and the retail auto loan sales retail auto coverage of increased basis points entirely driven by loan sales executed within the quarter which was comprised of seasoned loans with lower loss content as a reminder for our cecl reserving process we leverage a 12month macroeconomic forecast which has unemployment increasing to this year longer term we assume unemployment increases to approximately under our reversion to mean methodology lets turn to slide to discuss retail auto credit in more detail on a fullyear basis chargeoffs of were in line with the guide we provided a year ago and within the fourth quarter net chargeoffs of were on the low end of our most recent guide within the quarter improving front book performance coupled with stable flowtoloss rates was more than enough to offset softness in used values which ended the quarter around lower than we assumed when providing guidance looking at delinquency trends the yearoveryear rate of change declined again for the fourth consecutive quarter with 30plus up basis points yearoveryear basis points excluding the impact of loan sales weve been active in optimizing the buybacks to remove underperforming segments and maximize through the cycle adjusted returns our curtailment actions began in mid2022 and the cumulative impact of those actions has been significant in terms of volume but even more so in terms of loss content removed from our origination profile we continue to be encouraged by granular performance monitoring with all origination vintages showing improved performance as they seasoned in terms of specific cohorts the most seasoned parts of the portfolio from and earlier continue to outperform priced loss expectations and have passed their peak loss period the vintage more specifically the second half of is showing elevated loss content versus expectations but again the vintage has consistently shown improving performance over time its early to evaluate the vintage but we are encouraged by initial performance indicators and our shift of the credit spectrum in april of meaningfully reduced the absolute loss content on our most recent vintages the vintages started to outperform in terms of delinquency after months on book and we expect that outperformance to expand as we move forward given the underwriting changes weve made over time and the shift into superprime in april its important to remember the first six months of any vintage is noisy and we really start to get a good look closer to months ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 on the page weve shown more detail comparing months to of the and vintages and as you can see the vintage curve has started to bend favorably and we expect that to continue over time we note delinquency trends by vintage or a focal area but we also look at the same trends on an actual loss basis and on that basis the vintage looks even better relative to as you all know weve actively refined our approach to collections over time including extension of repo timing in total thats resulted in more churn in the delinquency bucket but a meaningful improvement in eventual losses so delinquency trends are encouraging and loss performance is even more encouraging as we sit here today we feel our underperforming originations are ringfenced to the second half of with yields over for that cohort these are still financially attractive loans with that vintage entering its peak loss period now it will be the primary driver of nco performance in the first half of which well also see increasing unemployment based on consensus economic estimates later in the year we expect the vintage will start to drive losses down on a seasonally adjusted basis well talk more about the overall guide later but putting the retail credit performance together we expect losses to increase in but are confident our annual nco rate will remain below on a seasonally adjusted basis wed expect higher losses in the first half of the year and then improving performance as newer originations reach peak losses on slide we provide an outlook for used vehicle values which declined in and have declined from their peak we are assuming another decline in with much of that decline occurring in the first half of the year that would result in a total decline from peak levels of just over we continue to expect used values will stabilize and ultimately settle around higher than prepandemic levels with new vehicle production below prepandemic levels for nearly four years used supply will remain below historical norms over the next several years and provide structural support for used values turning to slide we help our dealers sell as many cars and trucks as possible as we have said before we encourage our dealers to send us all of their application volume we leverage our differentiated gotomarket approach coupling hightech and hightouch to earn their partnership we decisioned over billion of potential loan volume in record application flow enables us to be dynamic in what we originate our ability to pivot up or down the credit spectrum give us confidence in our ability to continue to book strong riskadjusted yields our passthrough programs allow us to better serve our dealers while providing a mechanism to monetize a greater share of our application volume turning to origination trends on the bottom half of the page fourth quarter volume of billion resulted in billion of consumer originations for the year across a diverse set of dealer partners used comprised of origination while the percentage of nonprime originations remained at the unique scale of our auto franchise and the depth of our relationships with our dealers give us a durable competitive advantage that enables us to be selective and dynamic in what we originate lets turn to slide to review auto segment highlights pretax income of million was lower yearoveryear driven by higher provision and noninterest expense provision reflected typical seasonality while expenses were the result of elevated repo costs across the industry and requisite spend to support the strength and scale we just highlighted looking at the bottom left originated yield of was up basis points from the prior year reflecting significant pricing power throughout importantly of our retail volume was in our stier which ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 represents the highest concentration within that tier in more than a decade the total portfolio yield increased basis points within the quarter including a lower contribution from the hedge portfolio excluding hedge the natural portfolio yield increased basis points this quarter reflecting the repricing momentum that will continue going forward the bottom right shows lease portfolio trends gains declined quarteroverquarter driven by a decline in used values and lower termination volumes partially offset by a reduction in dealer and less fee buyouts turning to insurance results on slide core pretax income of million included the highest premium earned since our ipo and solid investment gains total written premiums of million increased as we remain focused on increasing dealer relationships and benefit from normalizing inventory levels insurance losses of million were up million yearoveryear driven by portfolio growth increased gaap losses and the cumulative impact of inflation we have provided additional detail on loss performance given the normalization of our gaap losses over the past year and the increase in our nonweather pc losses nonweather pc includes losses from our garage insurance product and inventory theft which have increased over the past year weve been very active in terms of loss prevention and pricing for increasing loss activity and are confident in the growth opportunities ahead for insurance moving to ally bank on slide retail deposits of billion increased billion yearoveryear and billion quarteroverquarter demonstrating the scale and resiliency of our franchise we grew our customer base for the 15th consecutive year and net customer growth of for is the highest in ally banks history we now serve as a relentless ally for more than million customers we also continue to see growth in multiproduct customers and maintain our industryleading customer retention rate of over turning to slide ally credit card provides a directtoconsumer digital product offering with a compelling return profile from an alm perspective card provides a floating rate asset with an attractive margin and further diversification to our liabilitysensitive balance sheet from a customer perspective the existing nearprime product fits well with the meaningful portion of our auto insurance customers and were actively developing a product set that would meet the needs of our deposit customers in addition to delivering a great customer experience we remain focused on credit management and measured prudent growth within the card business losses in the portfolio have increased in recent quarters and are expected to peak in mid2024 the dynamics in our portfolio mirror what has been observed across the industry specifically weaker performance in the and nearprime cohorts which have been the most impacted by inflation for ally those cohorts represent a majority of the total portfolio resulting in a more pronounced increase in portfolio level loss rates beginning in we took significant credit tightening actions on both new and existing accounts we reduced exposure in higher risk segments by over million in because of our tightening actions including a reduction in new accounts coupled with reductions in credit lines heading into we expect these tightening actions on new and existing accounts to curtail more than million of exposure in terms of overall portfolio performance the return profile in card is compelling even in this period of elevated losses gross revenue yield including fees of provides significant return resilience to absorb loss volatility assuming losses increased to we still see riskadjusted margins of and a pretax roa of approximately assuming normalized losses of we expect a midteens riskadjusted margin in line with expectations ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 when we entered the business in driving a pretax roa of and enhancing the overall return profile of our largely secured balance sheet those economics reflect allys consolidated cost of funds and include all operating costs excluding expenses from the acquisition of fair square and allocation of corporate overhead while we have moderated our growth ambitions in the near term we continue to view card as a key part of our longterm strategy and financial profile lets move to slide and talk about two other products offered within the consumer bank ally home and ally invest mortgage is the largest purchase consumers make and ally home is leading digital experience we offer to further deepen the relationship with our customer our operating model centers on a variable cost structure enabling us to limit earnings volatility in periods where origination volumes are depressed most of the volume in ally home comes from deposit customers and less than of loans originated are retained on balance sheet ally invest is a key aspect of the overall deposit value proposition providing customers seamless money movement between brokerage and savings in total ally invest customers maintained billion in traditional deposits with ally and maintain an average balance that is double that of noninvest deposit customers ally invest is profitable on a standalone basis and offers another compelling experience to drive engagement and retention mortgage results are on slide mortgage generated pretax income of million and million of directto consumer originations reflective of the operating environment operating expenses declined nearly on a yearoveryear basis reflecting the benefits of our partner model we remain focused on a great customer experience for customers rather than a specific origination target turning to corporate finance on slide fullyear pretax income of million is the highest since our ipo our team is made up of industry experts with a long history in the business over the past five years roes have been on average including in our billion hfi portfolio is up year overyear reflecting disciplined growth on the bottom left we highlight net chargeoff history chargeoffs in this business are driven by specific exposures and therefore inherently choppy across the total portfolio our average annual nco rate was basis points since excluding healthcare cash flow loans the nco rate was basis points when performance began to deteriorate in we promptly ceased healthcare cash flow origination this portfolio is in runoff and accounts for less than of loan balances we feel good about our corporate finance portfolio entering criticized assets make up of the portfolio which is less than half of the historical run rate nonaccrual loans are at an alltime low of and our reserve is nearly times our nonaccrual loan balances weve provided a little more context than usual given the macro concerns around ci and some of the recent net chargeoff activity within healthcare cash flow corporate finance is a great business for ally with a long track record of delivering through many economic cycles before closing ill share a few thoughts regarding the coming year slide contains our financial outlook for as you know the operating environment remains dynamic weve talked regularly about the tailwinds that will drive our net interest margin and our outlook remains consistent we expect expansion in and see an exit rate around to which puts the fullyear average just under ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 in terms of updates to our outlook from previous calls our recent capital actions are good for profitability and capital generation but also impact our starting point for nim expansion the sale of ally lending has impacted our nearterm nim outlook by around to basis points when combined with curtailments in the card business our nim outlook for now incorporates basis points of nearterm impacts given the gross margin on those products the impact of these actions on nim are more than offset by lower credit cost and lower expenses in addition to lending and card impacts we also have higher security balances in the near term based on the oci rally which could be a modest headwind to nim if it sticks we continue to be confident in our nim expansion for and see an exit rate between and however these factors cause our starting point for nim expansion to tick down we have assumed the fed is done tightening but we are not dependent on fed cuts given the rally in rates we took the opportunity to add to our payfixed hedge exposure which protects margins should cuts not materialize in march as the forward curve is suggesting we do not expect a meaningful impact on our nim whether or not the fed commences cuts in march the pace of fed cuts implied by the current forward curve would however accelerate our path to nim towards the middle of next year versus the very end of next year in a more flat rate scenario we have continued to position the balance sheet in such a way that nearterm nim expansion does not require lower rates turning to other revenue we expect to of growth in driven by continued momentum in insurance smartauction and the auto passthrough program asset levels are expected to remain relatively flat yearover year but with a favorable mix benefit of higher yielding loans replacing securities and mortgage in terms of credit we see retail auto net chargeoffs increasing versus as our underperforming vintages make their way through peak loss in the first half of the year but as i said were confident retail auto losses remain below for the year total chargeoffs for the company of to reflect the increase in retail auto and credit card partially offset by the sale of ally lending we remain committed to cost discipline and have updated our prior expense guide to reflect the sale of ally lending in total we see expense growth of less than and we now expect controllable expenses to decline by more than weve taken another meaningful cut of expenses to reflect the sale of ally lending we are currently estimating fullyear tax rate of however we continue to realize benefits from ev tax credits and broader tax planning strategies that will likely result in quarterly fluctuation like so a lot of moving pieces within the pl particularly around the sale of ally lending but not a real change in our outlook with the tightening cycle potentially behind us we are confident the company is set up for meaningful earnings expansion over the next several years we see a clear path to net interest margin and a midteens roe over the medium term the exact timing will be driven by several factors including rates and consumer health we acknowledge continued uncertainties heading into however we remain confident in our ability to continue to execute against the controllables and drive longterm shareholder value and with that ill turn it back to jb jeffrey jonathan brown chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you russ the strategic priorities weve established guide everything we do and are unwavering and will remain essential for allys longterm success for years to come first and foremost weve worked to ensure a strong alignment between our culture and all our stakeholders we built differentiated offerings across our ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 businesses for both consumer and commercial customers and seek to find ways to highlight our unique position in the market well continue finding ways to disrupt the industry and remove friction for customers by delivering leading digital experiences this mornings call highlighted some our recent actions which make it apparent that our disciplined approach to risk management and capital allocation is only heightened in this dynamic operating environment weve executed a remarkable transformation and im confident in the teams ability to leverage these priorities going forward allowing ally to thrive for many years to come as this is my final time with you i want to thank you all for all the support im very proud of the longterm progress and sometimes that gets lost in the quartertoquarter progressions but wrapping up the year and looking back to when i went into this role it is really amazing how far ally has come it was just years ago this company was on the brink of extinction to today a thriving and wellrespected company and brand that is uniquely positioned to financially benefit as rates begin to normalize it has been a true honor to serve as ceo and now as i transition to a substantial customer with hendrick automotive i will continue to be vested in the longterm success of ally thank you all so much and with that sean back over to you for qa sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thank you jb as we head into qa we do ask that participants limit yourself to one question and one followup carmen please begin the qa question and answer section operator thank you one moment for our first question please and it comes from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone jb i just want to say that its been a pleasure working with you and best of luck at hendrick jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thanks so much ryan appreciate that ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe one strategic question i guess for each of you jb or russ maybe just talk about the decision to sell ally lending with this part of a broader review and are there any further changes and then doug congrats on being named interim ceo any changes we should expect to you whether on the auto strategy or the broader company strategy and i have a followup ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc great ryan i guess ill start on the ally lending decision i think you rewind the clock to kind of all the march banking events there and i think what that forced everyone to do is to take a really honest and hard look at all of our businesses our position and figure out where we had scale where we didnt have scale and synchronys got a great ceo in brian doubles and brian and i kind of compare notes a couple of times over the second quarter and we just started talking about a potential path for them to do something here and i think this is really a winwin for both companies i think this is going to be a highly accretive business for synchrony i think brian and brian his cfo are really excited about it theyre doing the right thing with respect to a lot of the ally teammates going along with the acquisition and so for them i think it fits right into their platform its going to be accretive for them and then for us as we mentioned it really enables us to focus more on the scale businesses we have in ally and obviously deploy capital in that regard and so i think it came to fruition towards the end of the year obviously as wed mentioned well expect to close that transaction in the first quarter but i think when we look at the business footprint today we feel really comfortable where things are at this was just a unique position and unique situation with this business fit and right in for synchrony and for brian the rest of the company we feel is largely intact we like everything going on at credit card today and in commercial finance corporate finance i dont want anyone to imply anything beyond that i think this was just a unique situation we feel really good about it so thats kind of the backdrop in the story there and then doug maybe you want to talk just kind of your thoughts going into this chair douglas timmerman a presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc sure yeah i think the simple answer to your question ryan is no theres no change relative to our priorities our focus our business plans very confident that weve got the right priorities where weve got a very well thought out plan and a plan myself and the rest of leadership team has a lot of confidence and relative to our ability to meet or exceed expectations so i think were very well situated there relative to your reference in the auto business we pointed this out in the prepared remarks with the competitive environment is certainly favorable the success that weve had in driving application flow no doubt is a differentiator for us and hopefully see that as success that weve had in building our yields and improving the returns of the business and our ability to be nimble and selective relative to where we play as well as our ability to originate at higher volume levels depending on capitalrelated capacity there so a lot of reasons to feel good about the future as well as the plans that weve got in place today so hopefully that answers your questions ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 no it does and maybe just one followup russ you gave a lot of color on credit maybe can you just expand on the comments regarding how you see credit improving throughout the year and when we do get to the end of the year where do you expect to be on a seasonally adjusted basis and should we expect that to become more the mediumterm run rate for the company just given all the tightening that youve done in the move up into the stier thank you russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great thanks ryan its a great question happy to provide additional clarification here as you saw the nco rate on retail auto for came in right in line with the guidance we gave about a year ago at as we pointed to in the call were seeing elevated losses on our kind of second half vintages those vintages are really ending and entering their prime in terms of loss development through the first half of and so we expect that to drive our loss rate overall for up a tick from the we printed in that being said were confident as we look at over the course of the full year that well keep our nco rate below across the full year but again on a seasonally adjusted basis well enter elevated based on that second half vintage but as we pointed out during the call as we enter the back half of the year were really going to see a lot of the benefit from the curtailment actions that we started putting in place and well see those vintages really start to drive our loss experienced in the second half of the year and well see that improvement operator thank you and our next question one moment please comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning and jb good job as ceo of ally and good luck jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you sanjay i appreciate that very much sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah maybe we could just russ talk about the progression of the nim i know it sounds like you guys havent baked in what the forward curve is assuming but lets just assume its correct maybe just talk about the natural tailwind to the nim as were sort of moving were remixing and then sort of what the liability sensitivity would imply over the course of the next year or so russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no thats great happy to do that sanjay yeah look i think as we said on the call if you take the current forward curve as it is six cuts in two more cuts in obviously a rate outlook thats favorable relative to where we were a quarter ago based on that outlook we think we get to our nim kind of right in the smack dab middle of ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 that being said we think about our business in terms a variety of interest rate environments and certainly to the extent that the forward curve didnt materialize as its currently constructed and were in a more flattish environment i would extend the path to nim towards probably the very end of and so again we dont like to run our business in a way where were dependent on fed cuts but the way that we look at it based on a number of different scenarios and a range of different outcomes and i think thats kind of where we are current rate curve middle of more flattish scenario takes us to the very end of and i would say look we took the opportunity last quarter during the rally to further put on payfixed hedges and that gives us some insulation through the course of such that we think in a variety of potential rate outcomes our outlook for is pretty much unchanged so kind of stand by our to exit rate even in a world where we dont see that first fed cut in march sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thats very helpful and i guess my followup question i guess this is for you jb it might be a question for the board just where are we with timing of a final ceo i think its obviously taken a little bit longer than we thought doug obviously sounds very qualified so im just trying to get a sense of sort of how we should think this plays out over the course of the next months or so jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah i mean sanjay i think appreciate the question and what i would say is the board has been very hard at work these things not always go in a perfectly straight line but theres been an extraordinarily amount of effort in interviewing and i think what ive appreciated about our board and ive been involved in it is not willing to sacrifice i mean we want to get a great operational leader a great cultural leader somebody that understands the nuances of banking and so weve been very disciplined in that regard i would expect over the coming quarter we will be in a position to announce somebody permanent but again its still a very fluid process i think very fortunate to have doug here ready to go have a really strong leadership team behind doug dougs got the full support of them hes got the full support of the board the customer base and hes been around the block so our employees know him and hes going to slide right in so im not worried at all about continuity in this interim period but i think over the next few months that should be your baseline expectation to when well have a permanent candidate but again no sacrifices here were going to make sure we get the right next leader to build on the foundation we have in place today and carry the company forward operator thank you and one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of jeff adelson with morgan stanley please proceed jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc yes hi thanks for taking my questions i guess i just wanted to circle back on net interest margin commentary as you kind of think about the potential benefit from the forward curve here getting you to a mark by mid just trying to understand what kind of assumptions you have in there for your deposit beta and as we think through the first couple of quarters of do you think that you kind reached as close to the peak as you can get on your deposit rate given that you kind of held that over say rate steady ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 and lets say the forward curve continues to price in more rate cuts would you be looking to maybe add a little bit more in the way of hedges as you see opportunities and maybe that would defer the eventual benefit to getting to if you do that russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc great thanks jeff thanks for your question look i think as we think and maybe ill start on deposit pricing and kind of maybe youve seen we put in another set of rate reductions on the cd side this morning our second so far in and so were definitely seeing some benefits already from the interest rate environment all that being said as we think about our deposit pricing and rates we look at our expectation is that we dont see our deposit pricing adjusting immediately but it does adjust and to the extent that there are further rate cuts in well see that in our deposit pricing but well see it in a delayed way in terms of our deposit beta weve been running around thats still our expectation going forward in terms of deposit beta and so i think i hopefully answered most of your questions there but let me know if ive missed some jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc just on the hedging the opportunity to do more there russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look i think our sense is the fed is done on tightening we obviously are somewhat opportunistic in the market in terms of just kind of looking at what the outlook is we took advantage of an opportunity in the fourth quarter where there was a real rate rally to take some of the variability off the table for us over the course of hard for me to project kind of how the markets will behave kind of going forward but look certainly if there are opportunities that make sense for us well pursue those but again im not going to speculate on the rates operator thank you and one moment for our next question please and it comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please proceed richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everybody and thanks for taking my question jeff im really glad i got on the line its been a pleasure covering your company and i really admired what i see as your commitment to the culture and ethos of ally and it really is a great legacy so congratulations and thank you so much jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc thank you rick that means a lot to me and one of the ceos i greatly admire is at the top of your firm that always prioritizes people and does things the right way so its been an absolute honor leading ally and appreciate your consistent support as well rick so thank you ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you i wanted to talk a little bit about two trends in terms of auto what we keep hearing is tightening of credit and raising of rates the borrower quality is going up but essentially affordability is going down russ you showed us slide where you basically start to balance that out in terms of the impact on credit but i am curious when you think about loss frequency given the decline in affordability is this really ultimately going to be a net positive one thing i would mention is that when i look at that slide it doesnt contemplate the impact of the huge decline in gas prices during the sort of comparable windows the vintage sort of peaked or was seasoning as gas prices were going up sharply the seasoning is gas prices are going down so i think when you sort of neutralize for that im curious if you actually think frequency will improve russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah no its a fair question as you can imagine we pay a lot of attention to credit were constantly looking at vintages on a monthly basis and even subsegmenting within that to understand the performance of our book i would characterize obviously the losses on the book as being elevated its interesting that that elevation in loss content is coming at a time when employment is so strong and so we characterize that as something that is very much driven by inflation and a number of our borrowers struggling with this inflationary environment so that impact is not lost on us that being said as you can imagine we monitor our credit quite closely we also pay a lot of attention to servicing and weve made a number of adjustments to how we service in particular timing of repossession we have found we get better outcomes delaying repossession it feels giving our collectors additional time to work the credits and giving our borrowers a little additional time tends to work out in our favor and were getting better outcomes by doing that and so we can see that in terms of the way that we look at our delinquency roles as well as our flowtoloss our flowtoloss rates have continued to be favorable going through this cycle you can imagine were looking at our vintages at a much granular level than whats available publicly and so when we look at page that chart in the bottom middle and you can see that vintage is starting to bend away from the vintages in a favorable way what gives us confidence there and that trend continuing and expanding is our more granular look as we look month to month and as we pointed out on the call the first six months of any vintage is a little bit choppy as they season but as you can imagine as were looking at this on a monthtomonth basis looking at improvement through march april may and even getting an early read on june july august gives us a lot of confidence in that curve continuing to bend and we look at it again looking at delinquency looking at flowtoloss and actually looking at loss development as we look across these vintages so we totally hear you on the point inflation is definitely a factor but again our kind of more granular analysis gives us a lot of comfort that when weve boxed the issue to the second half of and that the vintages show great improvement great improvement as you look month to month it also gives us confidence in terms of our overall outlook around our retail auto ncos richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc terrific thats a very helpful answer thank you guys ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc thanks rick operator thank you one moment for our next question please all right it comes from the line of john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys thank you for taking the questions and good luck with everything jb definitely enjoyed working with you jeffrey jonathan brown a chief executive officer director ally financial inc yeah a pleasure john thank you john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thank you just with respect to nim this year how do we think about the yield side i mean you guys have obviously done youve been very effective at increasing the new loan yields how much more is there to go on that front given rate stabilization in the macro and mix shift russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah look i mean fourth quarter yield expanded again to giving us over the course of the year a great outcome and remember thats an outcome where weve ramped up our concentration in the stier and so weve moved up credit the same time that weve moved up pricing weve shown overall a beta on the way up in terms of rates thats really helped and supported us now as we think about the outlook for auto i would say i think weve got a couple of natural advantages number one we just see a tremendous amount of application volume and that gives us a lot of information and a lot of flexibility with our dealers in terms of how we have the ability to move up or down and how we have the ability to use pricing as a lever thats a competitive advantage that i think is unique to ally just given the scale we have and the depth of our relationships with dealers and it gives us a lot of confidence in our ability to optimize our yield and on a riskadjusted basis in order to preserve our yield going forward at this point i dont think we expect our yield continue to rise but we do expect that we can basically use credit and pricing to maintain yield as we move through douglas timmerman a presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc maybe john hecht q analyst jefferies llc ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 thats very helpful thanks douglas timmerman a presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc maybe john hecht q analyst jefferies llc sorry douglas timmerman a presidentdealer financial services ally financial inc maybe one want to add on there as though obviously new originations continue to come on higher than the overall portfolio yield so youve got this nice natural tailwind thats going to show itself so you would expect the overall portfolio yield to continue increasing for the next several quarters russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc yeah yeah thats right when i talk about yield i was really focused on the origination yield maintaining near the level where it is today but obviously on the portfolio side that is a natural tailwind john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc also on the portfolio side we do have some benefit from again ongoing retail auto originations credit card corporate finance at the same time that we see securities and mortgage with obviously lower yields rolling off john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay great very helpful and then followup question russ picking chargeoffs from the vintage first half of this year and then maybe some stabilization or favorable movements in losses as we move from there how do we think about the all over the course is it stable or do you move it up a little bit do the peak chargeoff cycle and then it starts to recede how do we think about the trajectory there russell e hutchinson a chief financial officer ally financial inc look there are lot of factors that go into the all we have a pretty thorough process and were looking at the macro environment so there are a whole set of macro assumptions that go into that i think as i mentioned during the call some of those build in a natural conservatism in terms of our expectations for the progression of unemployment rates in the near term and then we also factor in a mean reversion factor so in our models we have unemployment kind of mean reverting to over the medium term ally financial inc ally corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2024 and so lot of factors that go into that all hard to comment on the outlook for that going forward but i think our general expectation is to assume its kind of flattish john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay helpful thanks sean leary a headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc great thanks john sean leary headinvestor relations enterprise fpa ally financial inc thats all the time we have for today folks if you have any additional questions as always please
