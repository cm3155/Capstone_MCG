financial officer for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill begin today with an overview of earnings per share which was reported at this quarter this quarter includes three significant items first a provision for credit losses of million was recorded for purchased noncredit deteriorated commonly called nonpcd loans and unfunded loan commitments acquired in the aimbank and johnson branch transactions second acquisition and integration costs of million were incurred related to these acquisitions and third we recorded million of additional fee income in conjunction with the forgiveness of approximately of our ppp loan balances during the quarter excluding these items heartlands earnings per share would have been higher or so again this quarter core earnings were strong before i go into my detailed comments i want to remind you that our updated fourth quarter investor presentation is available in the ir website the ir section of our website so ill start my comments with the provision for credit losses which totaled million this quarter and includes the previously mentioned million provision on nonpcd loans and unfunded commitments in our two acquisitions the remaining million of provision related to the legacy bank and reflects the following components first legacy loan balances excluding ppp in total declined million and unfunded commitments declined million in fourth quarter second we continued to have some legacy loan downgrades and have a small increase in reserves for nonaccrual loans third consensus economic forecasts continued to show modest improvement however the economic outlook factors and components used to develop the allowance were not changed as it is heartlands assessment that a significant level of economic uncertainty remained at yearend and lastly net chargeoffs were minimal this quarter at heartland also booked a million increase directly to the allowance for loan losses for the purchased credit deteriorated or again referred to as pcd loans in our two acquisitions in total all the items i just mentioned resulted in a reserve build of million for the quarter that was primarily related to acquired loans so at quarterend the allowance for credit losses on loans was million or of total loans and the heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 allowance for credit losses on unfunded loan commitments was million or basis points of total loans together these two allowances result in a total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses of million or of total loans when the ppp loan balances are excluded the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses stands at of loans in addition at yearend we had unamortized purchased loan valuations on our balance sheet totaling million or basis points of total loans excluding ppp moving to the rest of the balance sheet investments grew billion this quarter primarily due to acquisitions and now comprise of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just under six years and generate million of average monthly cash flow borrowings decreased million to end the quarter at million or of assets at yearend our banking network had approximately billion of unused borrowing capacity the tangible common equity ratio declined basis points to at yearend excluding the basis points decline from our two acquisitions the ratio would have increased basis points and remained well over heartlands regulatory capital ratios also remained strong with common equity tier at just over and total riskbased at just over so heartlands growing balance sheet continues to be strong and well positioned moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter or million higher than the prior quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was or flat compared to last quarter as a basis points decline in investment yield was offset by a basis point increase in loan yield and a basis point drop in interest costs the increase in loan yield was driven by the recognition of an additional million of fees on ppp loan forgiveness as i previously mentioned this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion which was unchanged from the prior quarter in addition we exited the year with approximately million of unamortized ppp loan fees remaining on our books net interest income totaled million for the quarter up million from last quarter as the gain on sale of loans declined million on lower seasonal mortgage loan activity while total security gains increased million compared to last quarter in addition service charges were million higher this quarter primarily reflecting one month of run rate from our new acquisitions shifting to noninterest expense noninterest expenses remained well managed totaling million this quarter up million largely due to our new acquisitions when excluding acquisition integration restructuring and tax credit costs and asset gains and losses heartlands core expenses increased million to million compared to million last quarter this increase primarily reflects one month of run rate costs from our new acquisitions the one specific expense line item i would mention is losses on assets which totaled million this quarter and primarily relate to writedowns on several branches as part of heartlands ongoing branch optimization program as this program continues to progress we may have additional branch writedowns over the next several quarters so as we exit and look ahead to we believe heartland is wellpositioned to deliver strong results next year and would provide the following comments regarding first the loan growth rate exppp is expected to be in the midsingle digits with lower first half growth and then more robust growth in the back half a modest deposit growth rate in the low single digits is expected with higher first half growth from government stimulus and then some runoff in the second half the remaining round of ppp forgiveness will happen largely in the first half of the new round of ppp is yet to be determined however were off to a good start as bruce mentioned heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 the nim exppp will have some modest pressure however with higher fee income continuing on ppp forgiveness in the first half and higher purchase accounting accretion net interest margin is projected to be slightly under the current allin ta rate tax adjusted rate that is and be in the range for next year provision for credit losses are not expected to exceed million assuming a firming economy in the second half of mortgage banking income is expected to decline by yearoveryear deposits and service fees are expected to increase over next year due to recent acquisitions and a recovery from a poor first half in wealth and brokerage fees are expected to show midsingledigit percentage growth core expenses are expected to increase to million to million next quarter reflecting a full quarter of our new acquisitions and then conversion and all cost saves realized will fall in the second quarter will fall to the million to million range and then settle into the million range thereafter on a fullyear basis we expect the efficiency ratio to be in the to range aimbank integration and conversion costs are expected to be million to million in q1 and we believe a tax rate is a reasonable fullyear run rate assuming no tax law changes from the new administration in dc lastly we expect our tce ratio to climb back above as we get about to basis points of increase per quarter however the new round of ppp loans may weigh on the ratio during the first half of and with that ill turn the call back over to bruce bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you bryan valerie lets open up the lines for questions now question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from jeff rulis of dad co your line is open jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi jeff bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co hi there a question on the just on the nonaccrual well the npas in general if you could just kind of break out what the the increase in nonaccrual and oreo linked quarter what was legacy what was acquired heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan you want to answer that first and then bryan maybe follow up bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah absolutely largely when you look at the nonaccruals it was actually if you look at it from an npl standpoint we actually had a reduction from a legacy heartland perspective of almost million so when you actually take them together what we really saw was the overall increase that youre seeing today which is a little bit closer to just north of million so really its a positive story overall as we continue to work with our customers especially given some of the headwinds were all facing today as bruce said were very optimistic or cautiously optimistic about the credit performance and continue to remain so as we look forward bryan would you like to add some additional clarity onto some of those numbers as well bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc no i think you got them pretty close i would just say theres a table on page at least on my printout of our press release tables that can help you out jeff but it jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc basically shows that our nonperformers went up about million and we acquired almost million in our acquisitions so thats where nathan was saying had we not had the acquisition our nonperformers wouldve actually gone down jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great yeah i just hadnt had time to look at the table thanks maybe just overview on capital then you saw the dividend increase youve got these deals working and i guess and i got your comments on tce probably looking to preserve that in the short run but just thoughts on i heard about the ma pipeline but indiscernible what do we look for in in all types of capital from ma i guess we should be set on dividend anything any thoughts on buyback thanks bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc bryan you want to kind of walk through that explain how we plan to build the capital back up through earnings heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think jeff you had it pretty much right i mean well grow back up as i said through just with earnings projected for next year and the balance sheet growth that we have projected now that excludes any acquisitions so and with the acquisitions we typically will issue stock as part of that so i think you might see in the first half of the year things will be a little bit tighter especially if we do this next round of ppps so our tce could stay relatively flat and then really kind of move up in the last half of the year earnings our payout ratio right now at per share is right around of earnings give or take a little bit so well see how earnings go as to whether we could increase that some more well see how ma goes to see how we need to utilize that capital and right now we dont see any share buybacks in the near horizon but well see how things progress jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay and one last one for you bryan while i got you just i didnt hear a total noninterest income i think you piecemealed it but is there a run rate with kind of allin acquired loans which youre looking for in the first quarter of the noninterest income bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think let me just shuffle a piece of paper here if you kind of look at the quarter so if you back out the gains and losses i think the quarter is about million which really is about the same as what it was the quarter before so weve been running about million of noninterest income two more months of aim and johnson should add about million but probably see a little bit of seasonality so id probably say in the first quarter i would say youd probably be somewhere in that million to million and then youd probably come up with some seasonality and better mortgage fees coming through probably up to million or million as you go across the midquarters and maybe back down to million or something like that so jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thats helpful and you said mortgage for the full year down yearoveryear but just try to bake in that seasonality bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah i would say jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc kind of just last year and kind of or maybe drop them all above that you probably get about the right seasonality to that heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great ill step back thank you operator thank you our next question comes from andrew liesch of piper sandler your line is open andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey everyone good afternoon lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co just want to touch base on the loan growth forecasts i know in recent years growing organically has been a little bit challenging some of thats been by design though i mean what gives you confidence what are your borrowers telling you right now that give you confidence that youll be able to hit midsingledigit growth this year bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah ill take that one this is bruce our pipelines are reflecting that theres significantly increased activity we did get organic growth in the fourth quarter in the commercial portfolio we also are running and focusing on the consumer portfolio so we dont think that were going to run into those headwinds and our applications during the first quarter would reflect organic growth in the consumer portfolio so we think between what we have in our pipelines and quite frankly in the last six months weve hired new commercial leaders in of our markets and that is also boosting some of the pipeline activity so between additions of talent sort of getting away from or learning to call in the covid world our pipelines are filling up andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it great thats good to hear bryan just on your margin outlook what does that assume for i guess liquidity there i mean that can be such a wildcard and a driver of it i mean i guess whats the right average earning asset types were using what are you guys seeing for deposit flows and how large of a balance sheet should we be looking at bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think that the balance sheet will go up a little bit but remember theres ppp in there that will be paying off and then some will come back on so its really i would say a slightly growing indiscernible but i think were up for net of i would say were going to probably be up million just on overall assets but again theres going to be lots of churning right because weve got flow coming off of the investment portfolio that wed like to turn into loans rather than just grow the balance sheet so i dont know that heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 youre going to have a hugely larger balance sheet than we have today but hopefully a better mix of earning assets ph to kind of help point the nim andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it okay thats helpful ill step back thanks operator thank you our next question comes from terry mcevoy of stephens your line is open terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good evening everyone lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi terry bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi so if i just look at heartlands stock its up almost exactly since the end of september and my question is what are pricing expectations for banks that are billion to billion of assets that kind of fit that criteria have pricing expectations kind of corresponded with publicly traded bank stocks lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc terry i would say they have moved up it was pretty tough going there but we were at our lows but i do believe people are starting to say if youre trading at x times earnings and x times tangible book then cant we expect something in that range or better terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you and bryan just want to clarify the margin guidance of that incorporates the remaining ppp fees from round one as well as a stepup in anticipated accretion from the deals that closed in the fourth quarter bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc correct yeah it wouldnt have any ppp too because im not sure what that is yet so thats correct heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then just last question here i mean in the press release youve got here chargeoffs could be elevated given that they were just basis point here in the fourth quarter any thoughts on chargeoffs i know bryan you talked about the provision but the elevated i wont say it scared me but it caught my eyes as i read the release bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i dont want bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc nathan you want to comment on that nathan jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah as we continue to work with our customers and really look at the cycle kind of whats coming we do realize and certainly our allowance has been elevated to account for that weve maintained a very conservative approach but i dont know if the word elevated is probably being used in the right term here were really just looking at it from a perspective of where it has been and just looking at over the next year im thinking its probably going to stay more in that range i think the guidance bryan gave earlier was really around that million so seeing it elevated from this last quarter i think looking out next year i think its appropriate to probably look at that range bryan is there anything youd like to add as far as additional color there as far as what you gave as far as guidance bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think what i probably would say terry is we had i think basis points for the full year this year but it was real choppy i think youre going to continue to see choppiness and hopefully itll be better but you could see it pop up into that range again a lot of that though i think if weve done our reserving correctly under cecl we have a lot of that already reserved for and how weve already got some economic components in there weve been picking up the downgrades as those have been happening so if those do end up in chargeoffs weve been increasing in reserve as we go so we could see some elevated i think its hard to say that they wouldnt go up given that were not out of the pandemic yet and we only had the basis point this last quarter so thats bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc and so terry how i would maybe frame it its going to be elevated from historical levels of in that sort of basispoint range clearly basis point was outstanding and were very pleased with that in the fourth quarter but we think its going to be elevated from historical level probably a lot closer to the to basis points for the year going forward if we had to give you specific guidance terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great appreciate that thank you heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc i think the key there terry is that weve already provided for it so even though we have the net chargeoffs theyre a bit elevated over historic levels were not going to have to be providing for it its already in the reserves terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks operator operator instructions you have a question from damon delmonte of kbw your line is open damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon guys hope everybody is doing well these days bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yes damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc a lot of my questions have been asked and answered but just maybe broadly speaking on the outlook for ma do you feel like the dialogue with potential targets has been increasing and is it reasonable to expect one or maybe two deals that to be announced here in lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc yeah damon i would think that you could expect maybe two deals announced but we would only have the aimbank conversion which is going to take place midfebruary and then we probably the anything else would be converted in the third quarter we might have two announcements but wed probably push out the next announcement into the first quarter of we have a number of tier tier projects that we need to get done so i would expect only two conversions this year the aimbank conversion and maybe one additional one but you may hear about another opportunity announced theres still a pretty active group of prospects that were working with right now so you never know if youre going to get him or not but theres some active opportunities that were working on right now and some of them have advanced in time one very nice acquisition we thought would be maybe coming around in the second half of this year and it seems to be advancing into the first half of this year now damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and with respect to geographic focus is one area of the footprint more attractive these days and present better opportunities than others heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 25jan2021 lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc well we actually have relationships across all of our markets as well as new markets but as ive said in the past we really are focused on inmarket transactions they provide greater synergies and they give us more market dominance in the markets were in so the one were working on right now is midwest and the other one that i was talking about or other two would be out west damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great very helpful thank you very much lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc yes operator thank you operator instructions im showing no further questions at this time i will turn the call back over to mr lee for any closing remarks bruce k lee president chief
