let me turn it over to ron ronald philip ohanley president chief executive officer director state street corp thanks ilene and good morning everyone turning to slide three we announced our fourth quarter and full year financial results this morning fourth quarter eps and roe were and respectively while full year eps was and roe was exnotables fourth quarter eps was and roe was relative to both the prior year period and the third quarter of i am pleased to report that our fourth quarter pretax margin improved reaching excluding notable items we also saw an improvement in pre tax margin at global advisors relative to the third quarter of before reviewing our performance further let me touch on some of the macro factors that had an effect in following the dramatic global equity market selloff in late our results over the course of benefited from the steady recovery of the us equity market during the year while international equity markets improved somewhat average levels in were still down relative to the full year of total industry fund flows were favorable to primarily driven by broadbased flows in europe and strong money market flows however in north america industry flows into longterm funds remained negative albeit less state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 so in we experienced three interest rate cuts and lower longend rates which impacted nii as well as low market volatility for much of the year which in turn impacted our markets businesses our full year results also reflected the impact from the still elevated level of industry servicing and pricing pressure which moderated for us in the second half of the year as a result of these headwinds it was clear that we needed to take aggressive management actions to stabilize revenues and reduce expenses while keeping client satisfaction at the center of all we do im pleased with the progress we made and how that translated into results particularly in the second half of the year assets under custody and administration increased quarteroverquarter to a record trillion saw a strong level of new wins during the quarter totaling billion which took our total wins in to just over trillion within touching distance of our record amount of wins in assets yet to be installed stood at trillion at quarter end at global advisors assets under management increased quarteroverquarter to a record trillion supported by higher period end market levels and strong us and european net flows to our spdr range of etfs during global advisors recorded over billion in total net inflows driven by strong etf institutional and cash net flows relative to relative to the year ago period fourth quarter total revenue increased reflecting improved servicing and management fees driven by stronger equity markets partially offset by lower nii and markets revenues on a sequential and yearoveryear basis fourth quarter total fee revenue increased and respectively full year total revenue decreased yearoveryear as a result of lower fee revenue and nii partially offset by the positive contribution of charles river development we are pleased that we were able to begin to grow servicing fee revenue again with our focus on client service servicing fees increased during the second half of relative to the first half of the year during we implemented a number of client initiatives to drive better service quality and deepen relationships this included the completion of our senior executive client coverage model for our largest clients we also implemented a new client onboarding process that has enabled us to scale rapidly and take on large tranches of business while also meeting client service requirements further we implemented changes to better manage client pricing decisions through the establishment of an executive deal review committee we know that there is more for us to do and as we begin reigniting total revenue growth remains a core strategic priority for all of us we believe that building out our fronttoback alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients during we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduce expenses this time last year we launched a comprehensive firmwide expense savings program to aggressively manage down expenses driven by new resource discipline process reengineering and automation efforts initially targeting million of gross expense saves we subsequently increased our expense savings target to million which we exceeded finishing the year at million in gross expense savings part of our efforts were aimed at tackling head count growth which have been too high for too many years during we successfully reduced total head count by from yearend driven by automation and standardization as well as process reengineering with high cost location head count down by over state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 as a result we reduced our full year expenses excluding notable items in crd by almost thus exceeding our initial target of as we look to we remain focused on reducing our total expense base again this past december i outlined the outcome of the initial reassessment of our technology cost structure in the coming year we are targeting a change in the trajectory of our it expenditure aiming for it to be flat to down during excluding notable items for resource discipline and process reengineering efforts we are also targeting a reduction of total expenses companywide excluding notable items by approximately during during we were also particularly focused on balance sheet management as a result of a number of deposit initiatives as well as improved client engagement we have recorded a third straight quarter of total average deposit growth in addition as a result of an improvement of balance sheet under stress following the ccar stress test we increased our quarterly common dividend by per share further we returned billion to our shareholders during including million of common share repurchases during the fourth quarter to conclude during my first year as ceo in we have faced a number of challenges but through our actions we have made measurable progress towards our goals particularly expense management and capital return my focus for will continue to be on delivering a distinct value proposition and worldclass service to our clients enabling us to reignite revenue growth while generating further expense reductions sustainable improvements in our operating model we remain confident in the trajectory of our business we expect that our global reach and expertise in servicing and data analytics combined with our unique fronttoback alpha strategy will enable us to realize our vision of becoming the leading asset servicer asset manager and data insight provider to the owners and managers of the worlds capital with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone before i begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year results id like to take a moment on slide to discuss several notable items in we recognized million of pretax repositioning cost consisting of severance and real estate which sets us up to drive further process automation and organizational rationalization in we also had million of acquisition and restructuring charges primarily related to charles river as expected and in addition we had a million gain related to the tender of sub debt in and a million aftertax costs associated with the redemption of our series e preferred securities taken together we recognized notable items of million pretax or per share youll find a bit more detail in the appendix moving to slide on the top panel we showed our quarterly and full year gaap results on the bottom panel we showed results exnotable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends i would note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter on both the gaap and exnotable basis helping to improve our pretax margin both quarteronquarter and yearoveryear state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 turning to slide we saw endofperiod auca levels increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter the yearonyear move was driven by higher endofperiod market levels and client flows partially offset by a previously announced client transition which is now largely behind us quarteronquarter the auca increase was mainly due to higher endofperiod equity market levels client flows and net new business aum levels increased yearonyear to a record trillion driven largely by higher endofperiod market levels and strong net inflows of approximately billion which were spread relatively evenly across our institutional cash and despite a range of etfs amidst the challenging organic growth environment for asset managers state street global advisors realized aum share gains during the year in both money market funds and across our lowcost etf array its a reminder that our business is positioned to further scale its offerings and to improve margins in doing so moving to slide servicing fees were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter as ron discussed while industry pricing pressure persists the pace of quarteroverquarter servicing fee headwinds continue to moderate in with this quarters results showing three consecutive quarters of stable to increasing servicing fees primarily driven by higher average market levels and net new business and while equity markets were supportive over the course of the year we are confident that management actions taken since late last year including the rollout of our new client coverage model and newly formed executive pricing committee have had and are continuing to have an impact nevertheless there is much more to do as ron mentioned driving higher servicing fee growth will remain a strategic priority in and we continue to see significant interest in our fronttoback alpha platform we now have four wins all of which have expanded our scope of business with existing clients on the bottom right panel of this page weve again included some sales performance indicators to provide a little more texture as you can see auca wins totaled billion in and approximately trillion for the full year the sizable wins this quarter and throughout the year again demonstrate the benefit of our scale and capabilities as we build new relationships and continue to grow existing client relationships by providing additional products and services turning to slide let me discuss the other fee revenue lines beginning with management fees revenues were up yearonyear primarily due to higher average equity market levels and inflows from etf and cash partially offset by mix changes away from higher fee institutional products compared to management fees were up driven by higher average equity market levels and inflows from etf partially offset by outflows from institutional fx trading services were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter as the business was negatively impacted by low volatility levels partially offset by higher volumes securities finance revenues were also down yearonyear and quarteronquarter due mainly to lower industry volumes and spreads finally software and processing fees were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter reflecting higher crd revenue and positive marketrelated adjustments state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 moving to slide youll see in the top left panel a fivequarter summary of crds standalone revenue and pretax income crd generated million of standalone revenue which was up yearonyear and quarteronquarter i would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in the asc revenue reporting accounting standard and not to read across any one quarters results on the upper right panel weve also included a comparison of crds standalone revenue versus an estimate of revenue pro forma for the asc reporting standard had we owned the business for the full year as you can see crd generated million of revenue in full year up versus million of estimated pro forma revenues in full year on the bottom right panel we wanted to provide you with a bit more texture on the momentum were seeing in the business and how weve enhanced it since our acquisition last year we remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition turning to slide nii was down yearonyear and quarteronquarter with our nim declining basis points and basis points respectively the sequential decrease in nii was primarily driven by the absence of episodic marketrelated benefits seen in partially offset by increased deposit balances excluding the episodic benefits seen in nii would have been up sequentially our depositgathering initiatives continue to generate benefit average total deposits are up three straight quarters and up yearonyear interestbearing deposits are up yearonyear and noninterestbearing deposits have been steady for the third straight quarter at approximately billion on the earning asset side we targeted careful growth in client lending and a modestly larger investment portfolio with both the average loans ex overdrafts and the investment portfolio up yearoveryear on slide were again providing a view of expenses this quarter exnotable so that the underlying trends are readily apparent yearoveryear our expenses excluding notable items were down and flat quarteron quarter you can see consistent improvement in the comp and benefits as well as several other lines as you recall we announced the expense program this time last year with an initial target of million and thanks to a significant companywide effort we achieved approximately million in saves in the full year exceeding our initial target by nearly million and so let me provide some color on a couple of optimization initiatives that really helped us reduce costs last year first supplier negotiations and consolidation have been a big focus weve made great strides in both telecom and tech infrastructure services while also consolidating the number of our it vendors second the organization has been focused on realizing greater productivity automation initiatives launched last year have now led to four consecutive quarters of total head count declines resulting in highcost location head count reductions of about this year more than double our original target of more to come in as we continue to work on every line of the pl moving to slide during the quarter we returned a total of approximately million of capital to shareholders and for the full year we returned approximately billion of capital representing of net income available to common as we executed our ccar plan and delivered on our priority of increasing our capital return to shareholders moving to the right side of you can see that both the standardized and advanced approaches cet1 ratio is at a healthy even with that level of capital return we also consciously reduced our tier leverage and slr ratios primarily driven by the post ccar redemption of our series e preferred stock which is worth about state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 of eps we remain confident in our capital position and believe that we have incremental opportunities to continue to optimize our capital structure as changes to the capital rules are finalized turning now to slide id like to cover our full year outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter of before i start let me first share some of the assumptions underlying our current views for the full year at a macro level we are assuming slow global growth interest rates based on the current forward curve and a modest uplift from equity markets as well as continued low market volatility which impacts our trading businesses so beginning with revenue we currently expect that fee revenue will be up to for this includes servicing fees growing modestly at the low to middle end of this range management fees growing at the high end of this range and crd revenue should grow at low doubledigits regarding the first quarter of we would expect fee revenue to be down quarteroverquarter by low single digits perhaps to given headwinds such as the expected asset mix shift by a single client in asset management as well as seasonally lower crd revenue regarding nii we expect it to be down to in versus driven by the carryover impact of lower market rates and some continued rotation in the deposit book starting first quarter of we expect nii to be down about sequentially driven by the full quarter impact of the octobers fed rate cut lower day count and the fourth quarter longterm debt issuance on a positive note we do expect that nii should largely stabilize in the second half of assuming of course that there isnt a significant change in the interest rate environment turning to expenses as you can see in the walk we will continue to be laserfocused on expenses and expect to achieve approximately to in savings driven by our continued focus on resource discipline and process engineering as well as our technology optimization plan this will include a reduction in head count of an additional roles in highcost locations in which is related to the repositioning charge i mentioned earlier these expense saves will be partially offset by approximately to of ongoing business building investments in areas like crd tech infrastructure and the variable costs of new business growth this should yield a net reduction excluding notable items in total expenses regarding first quarter we expect expenses to be largely in line with this guide yearoveryear and consistent with the seasonal expenses usually occurring in the first quarter taxes should be in the to range for the year but we expect first quarter to be at the high end of that range and finally given our strong capital position and recent capital optimization we expect to continue to actively return capital to common equity holders in the form of payouts and returns subject of course to the federal reserve scenarios and associated approvals so moving to our summary of full year results on page we were pleased to see fee revenue improve over the course of the recent quarters as management actions and moderating fee pressure helped drive total fee revenue up in the second half of versus the first half at the same time we continue to navigate a challenging interest rate environment and enhance nii with deposit gathering initiatives with three straight quarters of total deposit growth state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 we also successfully executed on our full year expense savings program significantly exceeding our initial savings and head count reduction targets and helping drive down expenses exnotable items and crd by yearoveryear demonstrating our ability to bend the cost curve were committed to doing more in finally we continue to optimize our capital structure and delivered on our promise of increased capital return to shareholders with approximately billion in capital return in for a total payout of and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley president chief executive officer director state street corp operator can we open the line to questions question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking the question eric you just ran through a bunch of color on expectations for the year in one that i was hoping to dig a little in on is the fee revenue side i think you said that the fee revenue growth is down to sequentially and you gave a couple of factors does that guidance include what weve seen so far yeartodate in the equity markets which has been pretty robust or is that a potential offset if it proves to be durable through the quarter thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brennan its eric the guidance is effectively as of a combination at the end of the year and obviously if theres large dislocations between then and now we factor it in i think youd say equity markets are up volatility is still though on and trading is still pretty light weve not seen that big january uptick that i think we used to four five years ago interest rates are been call it puttering around so i dont think theres a lot thats really changed and this is an outlook effectively based on what we see now i think that i described theres some of this is just the usual seasonality like in charles river which peaks in fourth quarter just because of the cycle of sales that come through and then dip in first quarter we have some visibility into servicing fees asset management fees i noted will take a bit of a step down trading well see so its kind of a combination that were looking at brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats all really fair thanks for that color and then when we think about some of these robust equity markets that weve seen and you guys have clearly done a really good job of trying to get your hands around the elevated fee pressure that you were seeing over early and leading into that state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 in the past weve seen some breakage in fee rate when equity markets rally really hard really fast because your servicing fees are not all just purely contractually a percentage of aucs basis points on assets under custody some of them are inflation some of them were pegged activity levels and the like so can you help us think about should we be prepared for optically the way we model state street some fee rate pressure here in the near term just because of those mechanical factors rather than thinking i just i know some people think that when the equity markets go up okay then the servicing fee is going to go up with the fee rate being flat and in the past it hasnt worked out that way so just trying to think about how to calibrate for that thanks ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp hi brennan its ron let me begin on that i mean in the past youre correct there has been a cycle when youve seen sharp up equity markets that has been followed by a relook by the client base at what theyre paying and they have a fee renegotiation and thats still possible i think whats different this time is firstly we have comprehensively been through the client base either at their bidding or at our bidding in some instances weve been the proactive ones wanting to take control of the situation weve tended to get more term out of these things and in general the level of partnership thats between us and our clients now is at a much higher level so i would suspect my expectation would be that certainly therell be some conversation but i would not expect the same kind of effect that weve seen in the past eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah brennan id just add the kind of quantitative side to this is remember most of our fee schedules in the servicing business are based off of averages average for a quarter or multiple months within a quarter or what have you and so its worth just remembering that if you tick through the depreciation stock market indices and i think there is a good table on the top right of page six in our slide deck the sp and this is to but if you think about it on a full year basis which i think a number of you have the sp was up endofperiod to endofperiod that feels great but the average was up only right the eafe average pointtopoint was up on average it was actually down so its really the averages that are factoring through and i just encourage you to think about those as you think about modeling the servicing fee effects and in addition those are what the but what we focus on both from a as we think about the calculation of the servicing fees but also what the clients think about as a part of the billing process brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats great color thanks and apologies for jumping in the weeds straight off the bat on you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp quite all right thanks operator our next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is now open state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp hi glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc curious if you could talk and you might have touched on it a little bit but if you could touch on your deposit optimization efforts whats working and where you are through the process youve been going through client by client growth is good do you consider any of it repo environment related and transient just curious to get the marktomarket on that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure glenn its eric let me start deposit initiatives were something that we really began to focus on fourth quarter of i think id say and then its been an intense effort for four or five quarters now and it really is in response to thinking about how do we serve our clients with our balance sheet now as you say sometimes its deposits sometimes its cash money market sweeps into the asset manager sometimes its some of the sponsor for repo that we do so theres a series of different areas i dont think its particularly the results of those initiatives on a yearonyear basis are north of billion of deposits tend to be more on the interestbearing side because thats whats discretionary its come in probably three buckets the largest of the buckets is working with our custody clients thinking about how to serve them on their discretionary cash sometimes its the asset managers sometimes its insurers sometimes its the pension funds so thats probably been the biggest piece weve also i think built up over time a book of corporate deposits because remember not only do we have partners and suppliers for corporations but because of our custody of the pension plans right we have often an introduction from the pension the defined benefit pension plans or 401k plan into the corporate treasurer and so that creates a natural access and then the third bucket is we always supplement with a little bit of cds or broker deposits but i think thats been probably the smallest of this so those are the kind of initiatives weve taken theyve been i think material in terms of continuing to build our balance sheet which then lets us provides enough oxygen in effect for us to build our loan book our investment portfolio our trading book and so thats kind of part of how we think about running the bank and then specific to your question of would it have been better different lower higher because of quantitative easing or not i dont think the initiatives would have been particularly different i do think there is more deposits in the system in the banking system and weve seen some of that probably starting in the second half of the third quarter in that kind of period when the fed began to intervene and into fourth quarter its hard to dimension how much there is but you and i both read the fed h8 reports and that kind of gives you a little bit of an indication state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i appreciate that and maybe one more on just the servicing wins billion in the quarter trillion for the year if you look at that thats over organic growth now obviously its a gross number not net i dont know if you want to share just a ballpark range of where net is but then the specific question is if you can help us with the composition of whats in the one but not yet funded pipe i see some of the press releases i see some etf wins in there in the fourth quarter but maybe just help us think sort of whats in there ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp yes glenn its ron its a mix of things that are in there some of it is true oneoffs meaning weve won something its in the queue to be installed itll be installed more typically just given the nature of our client base which tends to be larger asset managers and asset owners when we win something we install in tranches sometimes it could be very conventional business like we had a very large mutual fund win earlier in the year but some of the funds are more complicated than others sometimes the client wants it done in a particular sequence around their fund boards so theres some of that in there you can probably draw the conclusion that more complicated business tends to get installed later the other thing thats in there though is increasingly the nature of our business is that were not just winning a custody or accounting assignment but were winning all or a portion of the fronttoback meaning theres some middle office in there there might be some charles river in there so oftentimes what youre seeing is a installation of another service for an existing client where we had an install earlier in the year thats the way to think about it glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thats interesting i appreciate and is it in and around the range of the average margin because i know going piece by piece would be impossible but just like the ones that not yet funded is it coming in at a higher level average level or below average level eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp glenn its eric its i think as ron said its a mix its well its a mix of fee rate and a mix of timing and as you could see the to be installed was high a quarter ago its high again this quarter and so sometimes this installs more quickly sometimes more slowly so just i know its hard to model i just encourage you to put a big band around it glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc cool well your outlook comments helps so well take it at that thanks guys eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp thanks operator our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is now open state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys to followup on the nii outlook eric i was wondering when you talk about the expected decline next year can you just give us a little bit more color on just the dynamics of how much and how the lower rates from last year still roll through on the nim and also against your point about there being some excess deposits in the system but youre still growing these deposits from your strategic initiatives can the balance sheet also expand continue to expand from here so i guess its just a split dynamic of what happens on the nim side versus what happens on the balance sheet thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yes ken its eric youre right that youre asking the volume question and the rate question so maybe let me do that in that order i think from a volume perspective the two drivers that we see in this business are firstly the account of wins that we have in custody and accounting because those typically come with those residual deposits that the frictional deposits in the system and so those will come based on the kind of the win rates that we have and some of the installation i think the other one is the deposits in the system and i think weve clearly seen a bit of an uptick quarterover quarter based on the bankwide data as well as some of what youve seen in our results and a couple of the other banks but youve all seen that in the fed statistics i think the question is what happens to deposits in the banking system over the next year did we just did the fed in effect with its easing process over the last four five six months get us to a new level and then we just go back to the slow build off of that or is there going to be more or less fed activity and ill leave that one for you to think about i think that one is the uncertainty we do expect some amount of modest deposit growth i think that what were careful on deposits and we still expect to see is some amount of continued rotation from noninterestbearing into interestbearing or interest bearing into treasuries because youre seeing that in the underlying asset holdings of our clients in the industry and as we think about the volume of deposits going forward weve been comforted that there have been three quarters in a row of stable noninterestbearing deposits but ill remind you third quarter and fourth quarter of actually saw an uptick in noninterestbearing deposits and then it fell by it fell significantly in the first quarter of from so were hesitant to think that weve gotten to a sea change we like to see a flattening of that line but were hesitant to call that a sea change just yet which is why we do think there will be some continued rotation in the coming quarters and year i think from a rate standpoint its everything youd expect long rates still have a negative effect on a full year basis again long rates i guess i should say long rates have a negative effect as the tractor of the investment portfolio plays through and unless long rates pop up bps you still have that playing through to a negative you have the short rates are kind of have been reset and so were going to or its going to take three or four quarters to lap ourselves and so you have that effect playing through then you have as we think about the first quarter as an example youve got some transactional impacts right as we call those perhabs we replace them with longterm debt right because we have tlac requirement so in effect i end up with a higher net income but the i get it we get higher available to common but we also have state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 more interest expense because of how the pl accounting is for us anyway im hoping i covered most of it there ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yeah and just one more just balance sheet structure question to your point on the preferreds you did that redemption you said you were last quarter youre able to do that before getting even the final could you continue to do more in that ahead of getting the finalization of scb or does now scb finalization really lead any further decisions you make about the balance sheet structure and capital actions thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yes ken fair question but obviously were any kind of decision by us around ccar about interim capital actions that is something that we just dont have an ability to telegraph beforehand or to really discuss id just tell you we always look at the full range of what we can do were always conscious that there are periods immediately after ccar where one tends to have an opportunity it gets a little more delicate in the first quarter so let me just leave it at that its the kind of thing where i dont think timing matters a ton about when we take our capital actions but we are looking at obviously the change in the leverage rules and then importantly we need to see how the scb comes through and that i think well know in the coming weeks and then well start to gear up for this annual ccar process operator our next question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is now open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks hey good morning everybody eric i was hoping to dig into nir in the quarter around some of the deposit cost trends if i look at the nonus side it looks like it was a negative bps kind of number i know theres some fx dynamics that are all through that that could create a little bit of noise but can you help us understand just kind of where you guys are in terms of deposit costs how you expect it to evolve from here and if theres anything oneoff this quarter that helped that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah alex its eric i think there are a couple probably elements here that are flowing through the deposit costs on the us side and then the nonus side and the page for those of you on the phone thats probably best to look through is the financial addendum that we have page theres a detailed sort of average balance sheet table over the last eight quarters for everyone on the us side you see our deposit costs came down i think a nice basis points most of that is on the us fee side obviously this is domiciled view not the currency view but its indicative and thats really the effect of that october rate cut and the full quarter effect of that coming through adjusted for our mix of pricing and so forth and so i think you see the right sort of betas in that kind of range that weve been seeing flowing through that line the nonus domicile is a little messier part of what you see there and that one fell that those interest that interest expense fell more than you would naturally expect it actually went from a positive interest expense to a state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 credit in effect part of that was from the ecb moved and we moved as well we actually our beta was over on that ecb move just we had this begin to normalize nim in the international markets as other banks are doing it as well given that it seems like its going to be negative not for a temporary period but for a foreseeable future and so were beginning to i think the banking industry is beginning to reset what kind of nim should be earned on deposits because of that change and then we also have less in the fx swap costs and so we had less swap expense which then goes through that line of the pl and that we have in the footnotes and that just bounced around a bit with the costs being on the interest earning asset side alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats helpful thanks and then a slightly bigger picture question to you guys on profitability i guess when we take a step back obviously very nice move on expenses this year and you guys have more to do next year i guess when you go back a year or so ago you had a slide out talking about mediumterm pretax targets kind of shooting for 2percentagepoint improvements in pretax margin thats still the case but im curious whats the base and what total may be the destination here because in pretax margins were you guys are kind of 26ish this year so i guess off of which base should we be thinking about the percentage point improvement thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp alex its eric let me start on that because i think its something that weve obviously been thinking through the markets when we set those up for the markets where at a certain point they worked against us both on the equity market side which has largely bounced back now we need to kind of its going to take a few more quarters to get to a place where were pleased and that was in our outlook but it was also at a time when nii right was expected to go up and nii has actually gone the other way and i think i mentioned in one of the conferences late last year that that change in nii cost us effectively points of margin that said thats just information i think when we think about how we need to run this business we still need to drive towards those targets and drive to those targets at pace and i think weve been clear that at the time we set those that the pretax margin was in the range and id tell you if were at now we need to weve got plans to get to and and ultimately get that handle or the handle on margin because we think this is a business that should operate at that level and i think if you work through some of our guidance for this year you see us making headway on margin driving revenues up and expenses down and i think youd continue to expect that kind of leverage operating leverage and margin expansion is kind of tantamount and kind of a fundamental part of our planning process so were standing by those targets we think theyre important and they were well set and thats where were headed alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks so much for that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp yeah state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 operator our next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is now open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning folks can you just come back to the pricing pressure concept in asset servicing and one detail i did miss if you can just clarify the fee fees down to in just the servicing asset servicing fee component of that for but the broader question is weve had that pricing pressure i think that you identified eric a while back and then it had been moderating to that sort of headwind so just want to get your thought about that headwind coming into and clarify that that is separate from a mix shift and when i talk about that is a the common mix shift towards etfs and away from mutual funds which i know were lower revenue capture albeit they are just as i believe theyre just as profitable because of the lower cost of servicing them so maybe you could just talk about that dynamic in the as how that shapes that to up for servicing fees ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp why dont i begin this brian because theres a lot in what you asked in terms of pricing and how we think about our outlook on pricing and pricing pressure i mean if you look back on this business for time immemorial right theres been this kind of enduring deflation in the business which weve all come to know and live with and thats been a result of combination of business growing ability to scale et cetera and thats been historically at theres also been mix shift thats been underway since then too i mean the mutual fund to etf move is not new it certainly accelerated over the last few years so and we expect that mix shift to continue i mean the other factor in here is theres increasing concentration amongst etf providers we have a very large market share amongst etf providers but obviously as those providers get larger the nature of the fee rate typically is such that theyre paying us less than the marginal asset so but this is the nature of the business and thats what we have to deal with so we do think and believe and weve said thats important the pressure that we saw starting in and continuing out into we think thats abating but we this is a business that has lived and will continue to live in the face of ongoing fee pressure which is why we continue to be intensively focused on our operating model and how we build the business that can not only meet that but that can become more and more profitable in that kind of environment brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian its eric brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 yeah eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp let me add a little bit of a quantitative kind of estimations of exploring to help some of rons summary there so on pricing i think as he said historically theres always been a percentage point or so headwind on pricing per year over the last couple of decade two years ago we saw that pick up of a headwind that was kind of and then last year if you think about to that was also headwind roughly speaking and then i think weve described how weve been marching through a set of renegotiations and resetting of pricing over the kind of to quarter time period as we look into our book of business and think about this coming year whats factored into our outlook is approximately a pricing headwind so down from the and weve got some visibility good visibility into first quarter and second quarter and so thats factored into our outlook on servicing fees on a full year basis to your point of where does mix come out mix comes out in how we describe client flows and activity and its been relatively neutral activitys up a little bit with clients kind of transactional activity that flows youre right tend to work the other way around so thats been a more neutral effect in aggregate relative to past history where its been a slight positive of a point or two and then finally on first quarter you asked ill just remind you that what i guided to on fees for the quarter was down to in aggregate for fees the downdrafts that i noted were in management fees and in crd and so by omission i didnt really cover servicing fees because we expect those to be flattish and well see how they play out but thats our current expectation brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thats great color and maybe then just on crd you guys reiterated the revenue and cost synergy outline that you had from day one i know thats mostly a impact in terms of where you want to be maybe just an update on sort of the time line into that or how youre thinking about in terms of part of that million to million revenue goal for in other words is that are you making material progress do you think in as it relates to your guidance there ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp brian its ron i would say we absolutely are making material progress and in terms of the synergies that we outlined both revenue and cost we expect those to play out actually in the timeframe that we described earlier but the more important impact or the even greater impact of charles river has been around how its affecting our core business and changing the nature of the conversation and the relationships that were having with our clients as we noted we signed four socalled fronttoback deals or alpha platform in so in just over a year of ownership we signed these deals which in essence means that we have a comprehensive and complete relationship with the client fronttoback the pipeline there remains very strong and even in those cases where the likely outcome is not full fronttoback its changed the nature of how were dealing with our clients from a oneoff product provider to a true business process outsourcing partner with these clients and i think that trend will carry on in many ways fundamentally change the nature of our asset servicing business to the positive state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great and is it more of a linear progression through or more of a hockey stick into as the deals as you sign these deals in terms of revenue ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp i mean id expect itll be largely linear but with a bit of an uptick as we continue to build out the platform i mean we announced over the year various platform partners that weve added to alpha and these are providers that are plugging into our platform and typically where we get a share of those economics and i think youll see at an increasing rate over and the number of those kinds of providers on the platform and youll see then the increasing importance of platform economics and that will be less linear and more its like how any platform grows right brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp it starts out small and then momentum builds as more and more become part of the platform brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah great thats eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian its eric just to add to that the if you think about the revenue trajectory on the synergies for example part of what youll see is some of the leading indicators like bookings have started to tick up you saw those were up on a yearonyear basis and so thats what will begin to drive the charles river kind of specific revenues this year and next year i think in contrast to that some of the revenue synergies were around connections with state street base of revenues and in particular the trading and sponsored repo kind of revenue activity that weve quickly tried to link into charles river tends to actually happen earlier in the threeyear cycle than later just because of the speed at which we can either make the client kind of connections or the order management system connection so therell be a mix and i think sometime in this year well probably do maybe a more fulsome kind of where are we as were a yearandahalf two years into this deal and try to share more information sounds like that would be helpful brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah perfect thats great color thanks so much state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc eric i wanted to just eric and ron i wanted to just dig in a little bit on some of the comments around the expenses i think during the prepared remarks you mentioned that theres more to come and i would expect that i was just wondering should we anticipate that the pace of change the rate of change of expense reductions is something you think you can continue for the next few years or is this we get the down and then its more hold it steady or continue to grow so well i should say continue but grow in line with just core expense pressure so i just wanted to get your understanding as to the duration of your expectations around the more to come thanks ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp betsy let me begin on that and while were not giving guidance beyond at this point i would say that our ambition is to continue to manage expenses down offset by the necessary investments that we need to make we believe that theres more room for productivity improvement our automation efforts are underway but we have much more in front of us than what weve accomplished so we see a path to continued and ongoing expense management certainly through and likely beyond is the way i would think about it and part of that is if youre going to win in this industry thats what you need to do right weve talked about the servicing fee pressure weve talked about the pressure thats on our clients but its also just about being able to scale at the level that we need to i mean if you think about the amount of new business that weve brought in those assets could have only been brought in if there was confidence on the part of the client base that we would be able to scale that and i just think that to be the leader in this business we have to continue to get that productivity improvement driven by automation driven by process redesign to be able to take on business like that ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp go ahead betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc sorry i was just going to say if we get a slightly different rate environment where rates come down again do you feel like you have the flexibility to ramp up that expense reduction state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp betsy its eric that was probably where i was going to go i think were quite conscious that in a slower top line growth environment were signaling to on fees this year thats a year where you want to hold the expenses actually bring them down right because we need to create some real operating leverage and margin expansion and so i think part of the answer to your question is if revenue growth is in that lowsingledigits then expenses coming down is the right answer i think to your point and the precise question that if revenues take a downtick whether its interest rate driven or something else on the equity markets or something then we would go deeper into expenses and we ration our reinvestment and just do it perhaps at a different pace wed find ways to accelerate some of our other optimization efforts youre seeing what were doing in it for example that we described in december wed go deeper there and just think about where we were in january of we announced down and felt like through the middle of the year the environment hadnt gotten appreciably different and so we ended up with down and i think thats the kind of incremental action we would find a way to deliver if the environment were not favorable betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from jim mitchell with buckingham research your line is now open james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc hey good morning maybe first question just on the cet1 ratio standardized it jumped basis points looks like a billion reduction in rwas kind of what drove that and is there more to do there eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp jim its eric i think youre on the capital ratio pages where weve shown this quarter both standardized and advanced and we did that because our binding constraint now is effectively both theyre almost right on top of one another james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc right eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp and i think you need to be a scientist to really understand the trend in each of those capital ratios so let me try and ill well do a followup if necessary so standardized if you remember is more volumedriven with some very relatively simplistic factors and so the standardized ratio actually improved because standardized rwa fell sequentially and that occurred in particular in the standardized rwa of our fx activities and our securities im sorry our sec lending activities state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 and thats kind of related to the lower levels of volatility in the market and lower actions so that was the biggest downward driver of standardized if you take out your phd and want to think about advanced rwa our advanced rwa went up which is why the advanced ratio came down sequentially and the advanced rwa increased because of loan growth and investment portfolio growth and a little bit of ops risk primarily so those were its a little bit apples and oranges but that was the driver i think from our perspective we it just its a good reminder that we live in a world of both and we obviously will manage to both i think what i found comforting is notwithstanding all our capital actions that weve taken and our higher payout we actually are at real healthy capital levels and that obviously gives us flexibility going forward it sets us well it sets us up well for this cycle ccar and we can take things from there james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc absolutely standardized is what matters for ccar and that going up is certainly a nice positive so but maybe just the second question following up on your guidance of kind of fee revenue growth of to just maybe to push back a little bit on it if i look at fees and normalize for seasonality and processing fees and then just annualize i get to almost growth in so it doesnt feel like a very ambitious target when you think about the sp is now currently above average level so you have a pretty big tailwind in the markets you have about of growth from auca thats yet to be installed the trillion or trillion is equivalent to growth you have a market tailwind and you only have about fee income growth is there something were missing i know you talked about the reduction in the fee rate but it seems like there could be a little better than that and just please feel free to talk me down from that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp jim its eric im trying to come up with a realistic forecast because to be honest wed actually like to be realistic of what were seeing and we also want to maybe back to one of the earlier questions if were realistic on revenue well do the right thing on expenses and so both matter james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc sure eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp in this business but i think this is a realistic forecast and obviously if something changes dramatically will up or down that could have an effect but let me just go through the pieces so that you have a sense so on servicing fees we said to the lower middle end of the to range so i think thats pretty clear i think if you think about it the equity markets in the us on average and the averages matter here james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc sure state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp will probably be up in the highsingledigits so that will provide a couple percentage points tailwind in fees there may be a little bit of therell be obviously some amount of net new business but theres also the fee headwind still that that comes the other way james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc yeah eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp that we need to overcome and so thats why we get to the lower to middle end of the to range and remember there are some businesses that are in servicing fees that are driving very quickly weve noted for example emea sometimes or some of the asset management space but there are others like our hedge fund clients are actually tending to be relatively stable or even in downdraft in some cases and so that works in different directions there are some puts and takes within the portfolio that were always conscious of i think on management fees we said the upper end of that range and i think you can square that with the lower stepoff in first quarter of that i mentioned in my prepared remarks trading i think trading is trading right now i think youve seen it kind of trend downwards over the last year i think volatility doesnt feel like its moving up fast its not moving up fast right its stable at best leverage from hedge funds or from those who borrow or lend in the sec finance business if you look at the industry data its actually down yearonyear and i dont see a quick turnaround for that and so i dont want to gear a business model to an automatic recovery in trading volatility and opportunities to find wider margins and so forth and then theres our software and processing fee other line and i think weve given good clear guidance on charles river and like you say you just have to be careful about the annualization of the processing fees and other i think just this quarter processing fees and other were up about higher than would have naturally been expected than a year ago quarteroverquarter and if you look at the full year i think theres that or even a little more in full year than in full year so you may want to think about annualizing either both and or even look back to just because theres a range of possibilities there james mitchell q analyst the buckingham research group inc all fair points i appreciate the color operator our next question comes from brian kleinhanzl of kbw your line is now open brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks a quick question on the guidance you did mention that there was changes in leverage ratio coming forward scb could also be coming through has any of that been that factored into the guidance or if those came through positively that would all be incremental to the guidance you gave state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian its eric well thats a harder question because if i answer it im going to show all my cards and i cant show all my cards because i dont know what the ccar cards are going to be like and so thats a tough one i think what we do now is we know the amount of capital returns last year we have some amount of view on this coming year but were still guessing and so i its i think what you should probably do from a modeling perspective and what we would expect you to do is think about the capital return levels that weve been at last year as at least a starting point ill let you take a swag if you wanted to add a little more or not at that but at least start with last year because i think that gives some earnings accretion to the eps line because of the retirement of shares and that should factor into your estimates and our that does factor into your estimates presumably in our guidance brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks and then separately when you mentioned the pricing headwinds in of is the new normal or do you still expect that to go back towards the level of a headwind that has been historically eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp brian its eric thats a hard question to answer now i think well have a better sense of that later this year in because what well get to is where are we with clients with whom we need to adjust pricing in and or some of those they tend to be three five sevenyear contracts there will be some that start to come through i think there will be some balance of trade discussions with those clients there will be some different types of deals we do in and think about the fronttoback deals have kind of a different patina to them whether they come with more middle office or sometimes with a broader array of services may not factor in differently so i think its just early to tell i will certainly im sure at this point next year give some kind of indication for i think wed like it to come back down to but we dont want to build a business model to that right now which is probably why weve been so emphatic about notwithstanding the fee growth that were expecting this year that we continue to want to reduce expenses in this plan brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks operator our next question comes from michael carrier with bank of america your line is now open michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thanks just a quick one for me you mentioned in the quarter some marketrelated adjustments in software fees curious just what that was and if its material and then in the fee outlook what was the client mix item that you highlighted state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp sure its eric mike let me take the first part of that on the marketrelated items in the software and processing fees there are several the larger ones are tied around the asset management business where there are kind of two underlying activities there is an activity where we seed funds with our own capital and obviously if those funds do well or if there is a equity market uptake you tend to have a positive marktomarket because they are effectively on our balance sheet the second one is weve got some compensation programs that are tied to different investment vehicles and because of how the accounting works those and again tied its i think relatively typical in asset management because of the way the accounting works you tend to have a markto market effect and an accrual effect but they tend to be in different time periods and so in appreciating markets as we had this year they tend to be positive in falling markets like we had at the very end of the fourth quarter of they were negative and thats why we have a big swing those are the there are a couple of other smaller ones but those are the lumpy items that we just effectively need to live with ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp mike its ron ill pick up the second part of your question there there we have a very large client where we do we have a comprehensive asset management relationship with them and like lots of other its a large corporate as its derisking it moves from riskon type of assets which have a higher fee to fixed income and liabilitydriven kinds of investments which have a lower fee and this client happens to be large enough that it will be meaningful assuming it takes place as we expect sometime in early michael carrier q analyst bank of america merrill lynch all right thanks a lot operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi i have one question that addresses the headwind and one for the solution so first in terms of the problem pricing pressure which you addressed you said its gone from headwind to headwind maybe not but a little bit better i guess isnt some of that improvement due to the runoff of lowmargin blackrock and if you have assets to be installed equal to of auc is that why you are conservatively guiding for to fee growth and if the pricing pressure is really abating on a core level why is that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp mike its eric i think there are a couple of different pieces there on the pricing pressure i think we try to be real distinct in our certainly internal analysis but also our disclosure around pricing pressure relative to other drivers of the servicing fee line so the other drivers are net new business which would include client transition or added business there is we talked about flows and activity which has been relatively modest and then we talk about markets so we talk about the different buckets consciously because it helps us better manage and i think if you go through some of the description that i gave the fee headwind we do expect to be lighter from this past year state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 overyear in we expect it to be closer to i think we do expect some market uplift in thats in contrast to effectively no market uplift in if you look at the averages and you look at the averages around the world and average those and then on net new business which would include some of that either added clients or the occasional transition out we do expect that that would be a bit positive in based on some of the last year of significant wins and in to your point it was actually flat in effect and that was because of that client transition so thats a little bit of a compare and contrast ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp mike on your question on fee pressure itself maybe the better way to describe it is we see the effects of the pressure abating at some level clients of course want to have the best fee proposition that they can weve gotten better at managing that and weve gotten better through the addition of additional services like charles river and the alpha platform of being able to respond to a fee reduction with either a consolidation of business offsetting new business a deeper and broader share of the wallet so maybe the way to think about it is there is always ongoing fee pressure and at times thats higher or lower but its always there in the meantime weve gotten better at managing it both in terms of how we actually go about managing but also in terms of the additional services that we can now bring to bear mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then part of the solution to that as youve mentioned is getting more efficient reduced head count four quarters in a row and really technology so i know you just hired a new chief technology officer but if you could just give some sense of your technology priorities last year tech spending i guess went up to billion where do you expect the tech spend to go and i know ive asked this i asked this at the annual meeting last year but you ended the decade with a pretax margin and it was when you first converted to the cloud and this predates you ron predates you eric but when you look back at that and you say okay what are you going to do different the next few years that you maybe should have done or state street should have done earlier last decade ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp so there is a lot in your question mike and let me try and answer it efficiently the focus last year was on firstly being ruthless in our prioritization of what was important and trying it much more closely to the needs of the business firstly our clients secondly what we needed to do for our operating model and thirdly what we needed to do for ongoing improving ongoing operational resiliency were very careful about the incremental investments we make what we need to make incremental investments that has set us up that if you will the actions we took in have set us up now to be focused on what we think are the right priorities we let go some personnel that we felt just werent consistent with the priorities that weve set and now what we need to do is just get better at executing those priorities we feel weve got a plan in place to do that so what we told you is that youve seen our historic growth our intention is to bend that expense growth just like weve bent overall expense growth well do that through a combination of continuing to reprioritize the gross impact of that will be reasonably high but itll be offset by the investments that we need to make to continue to be state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 positioned the way we want to be with our clients net result of that will be arresting of the growth but well probably still be slightly up for the year is the way i would think about them mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so total tech spend should increase what like any numbers or just a little bit higher eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp no let me just clarify we were very clear in december that our tech spend has been this past year to has been up right and up way too high in the highsingle digits at the to range and our plan this year which is factored into the outlook is to have tech be flat to down ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp yeah and that would be done which i think is important to understand through just like we manage overall expenses there will be some gross reduction in tech spending offset by a lower amount of tech investments to get us to a flat to slightly down kind of spending mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you operator our next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research your line is now open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp good morning guys ron in december you highlighted some hiring to target growth in the asset owner space can you talk about the competitive dynamics in that business and any differences from the asset manager side and is that something youre emphasizing as a real strategic priority in the near and medium term ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp rob we are emphasizing that as a priority for a couple of reasons firstly lots of the capabilities that we have are increasingly relevant to that space the asset owner space in the distant past was much more of a custodyonly maybe a little bit of accounting and increasingly asset owners of typical large and medium asset owner firstly is some form of an asset allocator and in many cases they have their own investment activities alongside what theyre doing with third parties so it lends itself to the array of services that we have the cycle time on them tends to be a little bit quicker so its a different selling cycle if it involves public its a very prescribed selling cycle so its something that we believe we can leverage a lot of the capabilities that we have and its not like were not present in that business already but we believe there is opportunity to grow share as that segment needs more and more of the distinct capabilities that we have state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp got it and then on the asset management side there has obviously been some consolidation in the ebroker space and i believe there was some speculation that this could have an impact on distribution of state street products do you think thats the case and maybe more generally can you discuss how youre thinking about your distribution strategy as that landscape keeps evolving ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp thats a good question and theres i think thats were still in early stages in that i mean at one level it leveled the playing field for distribution so for those that were in some way sharing revenues or paying to be on platforms when it goes to zero you dont write checks anymore for that so in some cases for us and others were not the only ones thats reduced our expenses but its also its harder to get its harder to pay for now a distinctive positioning what we do think it will cause is with if you will transaction fees no longer are the primary criterion by many investors we believe that its going to that it should enable us to point investors to what they should be focused on which is liquidity of the product the true cost of moving in and out of the product and weve got and despite a range weve got some of the most actively traded products out there very liquid in some cases deeper and more liquid than the underlying assets so we think this is an opportunity for us to actually focus on the liquidity side the importance of that for our investors but early early days in this robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research llp great thank you operator our next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ron and eric ron can you share with us you talked earlier about business wins and theres been a whole mix of different products that youve succeeded with this past year can you talk to the front toback business wins which obviously are new because of charles river what types of customers are you seeing grab on to that type of full array of products is it a completely new customer or is it no existing customers that are now willing to give you that opportunity to go front to back ronald philip ohanley a president chief executive officer director state street corp its ron the pipeline is were pleased about the pipeline is that its a true mix of clients we would have expected that our existing clients are a client where we had a large position already and therefore in daily conversations with them would be interested in this and that certainly has played out and in most of the instances that we signed in there were some existing relationship but whats been particularly gratifying is that we have in the pipeline and working very much through them towards what we would expect to see and they signed in or early state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 17jan2020 clients where we had no relationship or just a very very minor relationship where they see the advantage of being able to have a platform and it might be all state street products or might not but a platform that integrates it all and gives them the ability to reengineer their own business model its led to as i said earlier just an entirely different set of conversations with clients its not about well do custody for you that for a fraction of point lower than your guide and its much more about what are you trying to achieve in your business interestingly as youd expect some of the clients in the pipeline are those that are challenged by the environment others are those that are already winning in the environment and are trying to figure out how theyre going to be able to scale for the next or years so its a rich mix of clients and we think has just a very very large potential for us as we go forward gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then maybe eric i know theres been a lot of talk on the call about the pricing pressure that you guys have seen it went up to now it seems to be coming in a little bit and you talked about the mix of your business repricing which may be contributing to the reduction can you talk to the pricing competition though are you finding that your competitors are less price competitive than maybe two or three years ago or has it really remained unabated eric w aboaf a chief financial officer executive vice president state street corp gerard its eric i think its actually a mix of competitors in some cases and clients and others that actually drive the pricing headwinds and so if you think about it we are the largest of the providers so the asset manager segment in the us and around the world as a custodian and fund accountant and i think its those clients the asset manager clients in particular that have actually borne the brunt of some of the challenges in the investments industry and so in some ways were near to the bulls eye of where theres disruption in the investments industry and thats been why i think weve been disproportionately impacted its kind of the effect of having that larger share position i think weve always seen competitors come in and out of our industry certainly those in the other segments are envious of our position in asset managers but i dont think its as much a competitiondriven change theres always some of that but i dont think its as much of that and i tell you for every large competitor thats in the ascent theres a large competitor whos beginning to fade and focus on other areas or sometimes theres a small disruptor coming in there are other small players deciding that there are other areas to refocus so i think a little more clientdriven than otherwise gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc well thank you and appreciate the time that you spent on the call thank you eric w
