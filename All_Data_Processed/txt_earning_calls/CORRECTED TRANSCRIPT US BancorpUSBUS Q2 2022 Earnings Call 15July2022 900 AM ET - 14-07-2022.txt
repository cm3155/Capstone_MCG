and thank you for joining our call following our prepared remarks terry and i will take any questions you have ill begin on slide in the second quarter we reported earnings per share of which included per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of mufg union bank excluding these notable items we reported earnings per share of we achieved record net revenue this quarter totaling billion second quarter results were highlighted by strong revenue growth driven by robust net interest income and fee revenue and stable credit quality revenue growth was driven by strong growth in earning assets and the benefit of rising rates as well as good underlying business activity and customer acquisition trends across our fee businesses additionally our multiyear investments in digital payments and technology are paying off in the form of strong top line growth and enhanced efficiency this quarter we added million to our loan loss reserve reflecting strong loan growth and are consistent throughthecycle approach to risk management our credit quality remains strong and we are not seeing any trends in earlystage metrics that cause us concern at june our cet1 capital ratio was based on the results of the federal reserves stress test that were published in june we announced that we expect to be subject to a preliminary stress capital buffer of unchanged from the current level we believe our industryleading results demonstrate our ability to withstand a severe economic downturn which is a testament to the strength quality and diversity of our balance sheet and our prudent approach to managing risk slide provides key performance metrics excluding notable items our return on average assets was and our return on average common equity was our return on tangible common equity was on a core basis slide highlights digital trends in engagement ill now turn to slide we believe our digital capabilities and our complete payments ecosystem are competitive advantages that will drive meaningful profit and return differentiation for our company over the next several years our stateoftheart digital capabilities have not only created a more effective and valuable experience for our customers but they have allowed us to expand our distribution reach beyond our physical infrastructure while optimizing our existing branch network on the left side you will see that the success we are having with our state farm partnership which is driving more customers more loans and more deposits to our platform in a costeffective way the chart in the middle highlights the strong trends the uptake of our talech pointofsale functionality which allows small business customers to manage their banking and payments needs in a simple easytouse format that we provide in the form of a dashboard and on the right youll see the momentum we are gaining in realtime payments transactions which through the midyear are times higher than the total number of transactions we saw for the entirety of we are excited about the secular growth opportunities we see across all of our business lines but id like but one area id like to highlight on slide is our business banking initiative which is really starting to gain traction on the left chart youll see that the opportunity we have previously discussed to connect our banking customers with our payments products and services and our payments customers with our banking products and services us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 the chart on the right shows the progress we are making in growing accounts and expanding wallet share growth in relationships with both banking and payments products has meaningfully outpaced growth in total relationships over the past months and its worth noting we are still in the early innings now let me turn the call over to terry wholl provide more detail on the quarter terrance r dolan chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks andy if you turn to slide ill start with a balance sheet review followed by a discussion of second quarter earnings trends average loans increased compared to the first quarter driven by a growth in commercial loans growth in credit card and growth in mortgage loans commercial loan growth reflected increased business activity and higher utilization rates across both large corporate and middle market portfolios pipelines are strong going into the third quarter and working capital needs remain elevated in the retail portfolio we saw good growth in credit card balances reflecting strong spending activity and typical seasonal trends purchased mortgage market share gains and lower prepayment activity continue to support residential mortgage balance growth turning to slide total average deposits increased by compared with the first quarter growth in interest bearing deposits more than offset the impact of lower balances of noninterestbearing deposits reflecting the rising interest rate environment total average deposits increased by compared with a year ago slide shows credit quality trends which continue to be strong across our loan portfolios the ratio of nonperforming assets to loans and other real estate was at june compared with at march and a year ago our second quarter net chargeoff ratio of improved slightly versus the first quarter level of and was lower compared with the second quarter of level of credit performance across our commercial and retail portfolios continues to be strong on a linkedquarter basis both early and latestage delinquencies decreased for the total portfolio our allowance for credit losses as of june totaled billion or of periodend loans slide provides an earnings summary in the second quarter we reported per diluted share excluding per share of merger and integration charges related to the planned acquisition of mufg union bank turning to slide net interest income on a fully taxable equivalent basis totaled billion representing an increase compared with the first quarter and a increase from a year ago linked quarter growth was driven by strong earning asset growth and a basis point increase in the net interest margin slide highlights trends in noninterest income noninterest income grew on a linkedquarter basis but declined by from a year ago as lower mortgage banking revenue more than offset strong performance in other fee businesses the decline in mortgage banking revenue primarily reflected lower refinancing activity in the market which continues to pressure total application volumes and related gain on sale margins us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 in the second quarter total payment fee revenue increased by compared with the year earlier reflecting strong underlying business trends supported by investments we are making slide provides linkedquarter and yearoveryear revenue growth trends for our three payments businesses because of the cyclical nature of our payments businesses we believe yearoveryear trends are a better indicator of underlying business performance in a normal environment credit and debit card revenue increased to on a yearoveryear basis as the impact of higher credit and debit card volume was offset by lower prepaid card activity excluding prepaid card revenue credit and debit card revenue fee revenue would have increased compared with the second quarter of yearoveryear credit and debit card revenue growth rates continue to be negatively impacted by the decline in prepaid card revenue as the benefit of government stimulus has dissipated we provide detail on prepaid card revenue over the past five quarters in the upper righthand quadrant while prepaid card revenue is approaching a run rate on a linkedquarter basis it will impact yearoveryear credit and debit card revenue comparisons through the end of the bottom half of the slide illustrates the strong yearoveryear growth rates in both merchant processing and corporate payment fee revenue over the past last several quarters while we expect the yearoveryear growth rates to moderate from current levels we continue to believe that both merchant processing and credit and corporate payment fee revenue can grow at a high singledigit pace on a yearoveryear basis in a postpandemic environment slide provides some additional information on our payment services businesses on the right side of the slide you can see that the strong momentum we are seeing in techled revenue growth within our merchant acquiring business in the second quarter techled merchant revenue which accounted for of the total merchant acquiring revenue was higher than a year ago and higher than the comparable period a key to that trajectory is the strong growth we have seen in new techled partnerships in the second quarter new techled partnerships totaled times the number of new partnerships we acquired for the entire year of and we continue to add to that customer distribution baseline turning to slide noninterest expense increased by on a linked quarter basis excluding merger and integration costs associated with the pending acquisition of union bank the change in expense was driven by higher compensation expense marketing and business development expense and other noninterest expenses partially offset by lower employee benefit expense and other expense categories the higher compensation expense was driven by the impact of seasonal merit increases and one additional day in the quarter as well as variable compensation tied to revenue growth slide highlights our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio at june was as a reminder at the beginning of the third quarter of we suspended our share buyback program due to the pending acquisition of union bank after the closing of the acquisition we expect to operate at a cet1 capital ratio of approximately we continue to expect that our share repurchase program will be deferred until our cet1 ratio reaches following the pending deal close on slide ill now provide some forwardlooking guidance for us bank on a standalone basis this guidance does not include any potential impact from union bank let me start with the full year guidance we have us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 updated our interest rate expectations to be consistent with the market expectations we continue to expect total net revenue to increase sic to compared with given our revised interest rate assumptions we now expect low to midteen growth in taxable equivalent net interest income compared with our previous estimate of to we expect higher rates to pressure mortgage application volumes more than previously anticipated which will negatively impact our mortgage banking revenue we now expect fee income to be slightly lower for the full year of compared with our previous expectation that fee revenue would be stable we continue to expect positive operating leverage of at least basis points in excluding the impact of merger and integrationrelated costs associated with the union bank transaction for the full year of we expect our taxable equivalent tax rate to be approximately now ill provide guidance for the third quarter we expect total revenue to grow to on a linkedquarter basis in the third quarter we expect linked quarter noninterest expense growth up sic to excluding merger and integrationrelated costs as we prepare for the union bank transaction credit quality remains strong over the next few quarters we expect the net chargeoff ratio to remain lower than historical levels but will continue to normalize over time adjustments to our loan loss reserve in the near term will primarily reflect loan growth and changes in the economic outlook if you turn to slide ill provide an update on our previously announced pending acquisition of union bank in september of we announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire the core regional banking franchise of mufg union bank we continue to make significant progress in planning for closing the deal in the second half of while we await regulatory approval as you know regulatory approvals are not within the companys control and may impact the timing of the closing of a deal as a reminder we expect to close on the deal approximately days after being granted us regulatory approval because this timing would likely indicate a late third quarter or early fourth quarter close we believe it is prudent to shift the system conversion date to the first half of the financial merits of the deal remain intact our original eps accretion estimates are unchanged and we continue to estimate the acquisition will generate an internal rate of return of approximately which is well above our cost of capital ill hand it back to andy for closing remarks andrew j cecere chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks terry our second quarter results were supported by solid account growth deepening of existing relationships and strong business activity across our banking and fee business lines and we are well positioned as we head into the second half of the year credit quality remains strong and we continue to prudently manage operating expenses even as we invest in our digital initiatives our payments capabilities and in our technology modernization in closing id like to thank our employees for all they do and we look forward to welcoming union bank employees to our company i remain confident in the strategic and financial merits of this transaction and the meaningful benefits that will accrue to our customers our communities as well as our shareholders we will now open up the call to qa us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question ph i was hoping terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co apologies if i missed any of this in the prepared remarks but so it was nice to see overall deposits up a bit the mix is changing just a bit as you go forward i guess but maybe thoughts on major sort of what you would expect in overall deposit balance as we go forward how the mix might change and any thoughts on what youre seeing with pricing pressures on funding costs terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah scott certainly with the quantitative tightening thats taking place i think the growth rates with respect to deposits in the industry will be relatively stable or maybe even down a little bit but our expectation at least in the near term is that overall deposit balances will be fairly stable for us we have a lot of sources of deposits including our corporate trust and the mix between our money market funds and our on balance sheet from a mix standpoint as you would expect and what we have seen both for us and in the industry is that the mix starts to change when rates rise and so we are starting to see the mix between noninterestbearing and interestbearing start to change with a shift out of noninterestbearing balances into interestbearing sort of categories as people are looking ph and seeking sort of yield and then when we think about deposit pricing its been relatively low for the first rate cycle or rate hikes that we have seen and in fact its for us weve actually outperformed our expectations which is good to see and which is a reflection in part because we have higher level of consumer balances today than we did for example four five years ago et cetera but when we get into the next basis points so if you think about the next two rate hikes that the market is expecting our expectations deposit betas will probably be in that low to mid kind of in that ballpark r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats terrific color and i appreciate ph that so thank you very much terry maybe a separate question can you walk through any updated thoughts on sort of the capital ramifications from the pending us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 transaction i guess just a lot has changed in terms of both possible credit and certainly rate environment just curious to hear any thoughts that you have insofar as youre able to give while its still pending terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think that right now the capital implications are in line certainly with a rising rate environment the mark tomarket is a little bit more than what we maybe had modeled in the original deal but once you close that transaction it accretes back into income pretty fast our expectation as i said is that cet1 will be somewhere around at the time of closing of course that will be dependent upon where rates are at that particular point in time but the transaction accretes pretty quickly so we do expect capital to continue to grow and accrete after the transaction andy what would you add andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp the only thing id add terry is that as you talked about in your comments were making significant ph process in planning for the closing of the deal which we as we talked about now expect in the second half we targeted a second half conversion last time we talked and now and it was going to be veterans day given now that were coming upon a little later close were moving the conversion day to presidents day weekend so thats what our planning assumption is for all the teams working on this thats that next threeday weekend and as terry mentioned our financial targets that we initially articulated are still intact although the timing of the cost savings might be a little different the synergies are still million and terry maybe you can talk about given the rate environment the accretion dilution ph for this deal terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah again the accretion when you think about the earnings per share accretion we still feel very comfortable with respect to the accretion in a couple of different things obviously the timing will affect our ability to achieve all of the cost synergies that we expected in and so of the million that andy talked about our expectation is well probably achieve to of that next year but whats offsetting that is with the rising rate environment were going to see stronger revenue that will help to offset that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co right thats perfect andy and terry thank you guys very much andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks scott terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 thanks scott operator thank you our next question comes from john pancari from evercore your line is now open terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hi john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the payments revenues and the merchant revenue i know you had indicated that you do expect these revenues on a yearoveryear basis to moderate here but as you see high singledigit yearoveryear growth is reasonable postpandemic so just to understand that a little more in terms of the coming quarters over the next several quarters that moderation that you see is that going to going to put you in that high singledigit range or do you expect growth to be lower than that high singledigit yearoveryear range in coming quarters as payments volumes moderate terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so our expectation when we get to more of a normal environment is that payments would have the high singledigits sort of growth rate so its a continuation of the business the growth rates that were talking about in terms of moderating yearoveryear is really ph from the very high growth rates that we saw post pandemic as the cyclical recovery occurred but think of payments in the high singledigits john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it so then in the moderation is there a way you can maybe help characterize what type of level do you think is reasonable in coming quarters as the moderation takes hold terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think part of it in terms of moderating of growth rates part of it is well start to see from to kind of getting into a more normal environment so i think that its still probably a little bit of a higher level when we think about the third quarter or the near quarters but certainly as we get into i think it moderates to that highsingle digits us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay i got you got it and then just on the credit front clearly you guys are certainly in the more generally historically more conservative standpoint how can you maybe talk a little bit more how youre thinking about the loan loss reserve here particularly from a cecl perspective as youre dialing in the scenarios you have to assume the economic scenarios are going to get worse incrementally here given the fed actions so how do you see that impacting your reserving here just from a scenario standpoint and given the cecl requirements terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah maybe as a reminder when we end up looking at scenarios we look at five different potential scenarios from a baseline to something thats slightly better to something thats worse and as severe maybe as a more severe recession so i think about that range for some time theres been an uncertainty if you think about ukraine now and when we end up looking at the different economic and we weight those assumptions were really weighting to a little bit more of a downside scenario relative to that baseline we are trying to take the economic situation into consideration so i feel like were in a pretty good spot in terms of how we are thinking about it and what i would say john is that at least in the near term think about the second half of this year growth in or changes i think in the loan loss reserve will probably be driven more by loan growth than anything else john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it so you dont necessarily over the next couple quarters see an outright build related to the economic backdrop based upon the forecast that youre looking at now terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp i think it will be more driven by loan growth than our scenarios weightings getting worse at least not measurably worse indiscernible john pancari q analyst evercore isi right right okay and then one more related to that i guess just as economic scenarios do intensify and if a build does begin to moderate i mean any way to just longer term help us think about the magnitude i mean we just had another one of your competitors talk about how the pandemicrelated reserve levels may not be applicable to where the banks built the pandemicrelated reserves to would you agree with that that the pandemicrelated reserve levels were probably overly draconian terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 yeah it was as you kind of went through the pandemic it was hard to know exactly where the economy was going so i do think that the level of reserve builds were pretty aggressive and rightfully so at that particular point in time based upon what we knew i think that as we see the next economic recession kind of develop again john we try to manage through the cycle and our underwriting is strong and all those sorts of things so while therell be reserve build certainly from an economic outlook point of view i dont think its going to be anywhere near what it was as a result of the pandemic john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it thank you so much terry thats helpful operator thank you our next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc your line is now open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning terry good morning andy terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc terry to follow up on credit quality can you share with us certainly im with you i dont see the reserves needing ever to get close to what you guys had to do during the pandemic when unemployment went to and we had an annualized rate of decline in the second quarter gdp in of over but can you share with us in the rate stress testing for your commercial customers or anybody on variable rate loans at what point do rising rates really start to give you guys a little discomfort is it at or basis points higher any color there terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i dont know if you have andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think what drives loan activity more than anything is the economic growth and gdp and i think from a rate scenario standpoint in terms of credit risk if you think about the defense side gerard i think we underwrite to a higher rate environment for variable rate loans so i think weve already taken that into account and we look at cash flows under different rate scenarios as we think about putting those loans on the book so were less im less concerned about rising rates impacting credit i do think rising rates as that impacts the economy will impact loan growth at some point us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc no okay very fair and then i guess as a followup sticking with credit it seems like in past cycles excluding there was a gradual lead in to the downturns and we i think many of us could have seen what was going on in the aggressive lending of going into or going into we dont seem to have that this time so can you guys i dont know if you can give us any further color on what is it that the market is so seems like so concerned about with banks that were going to hit a brick wall or go off a cliff on credit possibly in to months any further thoughts there andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i do think its banks are a reflection of all the customers that we serve and to the extent the recession impacts those customers itll impact us and i think thats why youre seeing bank stocks usually when rates go up bank stocks outperform banks rates weve been waiting for a while for rates to go up theyre finally going up and bank stocks are going the other way and i think its that fear of recession for all the reasons weve talked about and as ive talked about gerard i think we are preparing for any scenario because the range of scenarios and i talked about this before is as wide as ive ever seen it in my career the probability of different events occurring theres a lot of uncertainty out there a lot of inputs into things that weve never had before and i think all that uncertainty just translates into people being careful and a little prudent in terms of their investments gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and with that are your customers seeing any clear evidence of the slowdown from the tightening thats already gone on or is it still are the customers still in pretty good shape in terms of their businesses generally speaking terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah maybe a couple different things that certainly we watch i mean from a consumer spend standpoint it continues to be very strong and that obviously is what businesses are seeing now that consumer spend is shifting a bit in terms of where its occurring its less discretionary certainly more nondiscretionary on food and fuel and those types of things it is probably shifting away from a lot of the retail purchases toward servicerelated type of activities but the overall level of spend is still pretty strong i would also say that the consumer balance sheet is strong they still have deposit balances that are in excess of where they were prepandemic i think in part thats allowing at least on the average for that consumer to spend to continue and then theyre willing to draw down on their credit card lines as well on the business side the way that i would characterize it is were continuing to see inventory builds i think that part of the loan growth that were seeing or experiencing may be businesses trying to get ahead of inflation a bit in terms of acquiring inventory today as opposed to something that might have a rate increase us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 the one thing i would say though gerard is that i think that business owners especially in the middle market space are just more cautious today and it comes back to what andy said it seems like a strong economy today but the range of possibilities is very wide and so people are trying to take that into consideration when they think about running their business gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc fellows thank you very much as always and good luck on closing the deal in the second half andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks gerard appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from erika najarian from ubs your line is now open terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning erika andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks just a new clarification questions for my first one terry you mentioned that deposit beta could be in the low to mid for the next basis points can we interpret that in terms of the cumulative beta by fourth quarter does that mean that will be the cumulative beta by the fourth quarter or does that mean that the cumulative beta would be lower than that range by fourth quarter because we have to take into account the first basis points terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp it would be lower i mean the average obviously would be less so what im really talking about is the next two rate hikes and what we would see in terms of deposit betas in reaction to that so erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it im just comparing it to a peer that reported also today i think they mentioned that the cumulative beta would be in the low by yearend and it sounds like based on the math you could outperform that terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 certainly in terms of what we are experiencing the deposit betas in the first rate hikes has been lower than what we had expected i think from just in terms of the industry and where we were starting from the betas for us at least have been lower erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and andy maybe taking a step back and asking more of an industry question clearly the markets very worried about a recession and clearly the market accepts that us bank has one of the best quality balance sheets out there the bank has spent a lot of time building their corporate market share i guess my first question to you is as you think about the relative resilience of banks potentially in a recession like gerard alluded to and the amount of sort of lost market share to nonbanks do you see some of that coming back to that market share coming back to the industry generally and us bank specifically or was some of that credit quality never something that you wanted to underwrite and put on the books to begin with andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp its a good question erika i think there is a little bit of a shift already occurring and what youre seeing in some of the nonbank competitors first of all the banking industry is in terrific shape from a capital liquidity just from a defensive standpoint much better than we were during the last downturn and that includes us bank and you saw our results of the stress test which showed us performing very well in a very stressful environment and i think thats a reflection of all those things including our diversity in our credit underwriting discipline i do think traditional credit models work through cycles sometimes new credit models work when things are going well and are a little more challenged when things arent going so well so well see how those new credit models and new ways of doing underwriting will work in this downturn but i do think that banks and certainly us banks models have been proven through multiple cycles erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and my third question is i think that most of the street subscribes to the idea that payments is going to be a secular winner for us bank theres clearly a debate right now on how weak does the consumer get in a downturn nobodys worried really about credit surprises in the consumer with us bank but how should we think about the range of outcomes in payments activity and spend if we do have a recession andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah erika it depends on how severe that recession is certainly but as terry alluded to what were seeing is the consumer is still in a very good position they have a lot of cushion we have trillion of excess savings versus prepandemic levels for us bank were still at two to three times deposit level so theyre still spending dollars that theyve not spent over the past few years and as you know the unemployment numbers are very good so i think theres enough cushion and i do think that at least for the near term that cushion will allow continued spend activity albeit as terry mentioned in a little bit different categories certainly from goods to services and a little bit more in terms of nondiscretionary but were still seeing strength there and again how that ultimately comes out will depend upon those that range of outcomes that i talked about thats pretty wide us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and just one last one indiscernible the fee income guide you said lower than did you quantify how much terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp im sorry related to what andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp we did indiscernible andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so terry shes asking if we quantified the fee income guide and we quantified total revenue in that to terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah we ph didnt yeah exactly erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc sorry im too much going on thanks guys andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp no problem terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp i hear you operator thank you our next question comes from mike mayo from wells fargo securities your line is now open terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp hey mike andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning so i look at slide im trying to look at im squinting on that and thats the number of joint business banking and payment customers relationship growth and you have that indexed at starting at march ph im looking at a blue line versus the green line and this is your big effort and so i guess youre up with my squinting here youre up yearoveryear in the growth in accounts that use both banking and payments is that correct andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thats right mike sorry for the squinting but yes so if you index back to were up just under on those combined relationships that have both banking and payments products and thats almost what just the total relationships are which would imply just single service relationships are below that green line mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and so how much is this contributing to your growth i mean you had outsized growth in payments slide you have outsized growth in commercial loans slide so can you kind of disassemble this like what percent of the growth is due to this business banking and payment initiative and how much is just due to the environment the onboarding of the economy postpandemic andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp i think its a little bit of both were still as i mentioned in the early innings of all this but i will tell you mike that we have a tremendous focus on this on both the business banking segment as well as the commercial segment and i think this concept of weaving together banking and payment services into a comprehensive offering is going to be meaningfully important to our growth rates both acquiring customers and providing more products and services ph to the current customers and it is a one of my top priorities its one of the companys top priorities it crosses many business lines and i do think its driving the growth that youre seeing in both business activity as well as corporate activity mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then an unrelated question i mean commercial loan growth is growing very strong and whats the pricing like on commercial loans it just seems like theres such a disconnect between the capital markets which is charging so much more for credit and the bank lending markets which might be charging more but not nearly as much terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think that mike in the commercial side corporate loan side of the equation its still pretty competitive from a pricing point of view and so i would tend to agree in the sense that credit spreads havent widened maybe as much as we might have expected at this particular point in time us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 and i think part of that kind of comes back to what economy are we looking at i mean its again today it looks pretty good but my expectation is if you have this type of loan growth and the economic outlook that people are kind of expecting you would expect those credit spreads to be widening and spreads to be widening in our loans more ph not seeing it yet though mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so does that i mean youre the most conservative bank in the industry based on several metrics bond spreads credit rating agencies all that sort of thing so as the most conservative bank in the industry among the largest does that mean do you forgo some of this lending or do you just plow ahead with the assumption that were not going into any sort of hard landing andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp no mike its a good question as well so terry and myself and our leaders are being very disciplined about what were putting on our balance sheet and i will tell you that while we had strong loan growth it could have been a heck of a lot stronger but it wasnt because we are not putting those deals that are either not appropriate from a credit standpoint certainly or from a spread standpoint or return standpoint so we are growing good loans we could have grown more but we didnt terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah and perfect example if you end up looking at the growth in auto lending for us over the last quarter or two those spreads have been very competitive they have not been responsive to the rising rate environment and were willing to give up some of the volume there simply because of the fact that returns are not as strong as they should be given the current environment so that would be an example of the discipline were talking about mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thanks mike operator thank you our next question comes from matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is now open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp morning matt us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i wanted to ask about the credit marks related to the pending ub deal obviously spreads have widened as was just discussed and just i would think that means kind of more marks and maybe just frame how meaningful that might be is there a risk that the cet1 is below and then of course on the flip side if youre marking that book down a little bit more aggressively maybe youre essentially done building reserves in that portfolio even if we do get the hard landing terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yes well maybe from a credit mark standpoint i think its pretty consistent with what we had expected i mean that portfolio performs pretty strong in terms of the marktomarket from a rate point of view it certainly is higher than what we had originally modeled out that will put a little bit of pressure as i mentioned earlier on the day one closing cet1 ratio which we still expect to be around it might be a little bit lower than that but or a little higher it kind of just depends upon where rates are at that point in time but as you say it accretes back into income pretty quickly and so its not really a significant concern at this particular point in time for us i do think matt also we talked a little bit about the timing of synergies related to the cost synergies maybe with the system conversion moving back being a little bit lower than what we had modeled but the benefit of the mark tomarket will offset that so from an overall earnings accretion point of view we still very still feel very comfortable with in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then just to summarize so the credit marks arent really impacted by kind of macro forecast and what were seeing in public markets its more what youre seeing in the actual portfolio as we think about the credit marks themselves terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean obviously we have to take into consideration what our assumptions are from an economic outlook point of view but as i mentioned earlier those havent changed a lot yet at this particular point in time and so again it depends upon the timing of the closing and what happens between here and then but at least at this particular point in time the quality of the portfolio is good its performing well et cetera so matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately you talked about mortgage fees being weaker than expected in your full year guidance obviously were seeing that for the industry overall but any signs of the gain on sale margin stabilizing and then in the servicing book it doesnt feel like were getting the full benefit of the slower prepayments i know there can be a little bit of a delay as we look across some of the banks were not seeing that is there still some benefit from the servicing book to kick in thanks us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah so a couple of different things as we talked earlier therell continue to be pressure on mortgage banking revenue we think about on a linkedquarter basis third quarter fee revenue in that area is probably going to be pretty similar to the second quarter but thats going to be a combination of things matt i do think that there continues to be a little bit of pressure on the volume side of the equation simply because of rising rates we are seeing at least for us the gain on sale starting to stabilize and improve a little bit our expectation is that it improves as we go through the rest of the year and certainly into theres a fair amount of capacity thats coming out of the system out of the industry and so i think that that will help in terms of gain on sale from the servicing standpoint at least from our point of in terms of how we end up managing them we try to hedge msr valuations pretty tightly obviously the values of msrs are improving because of that because of rates and i do expect theres probably opportunity from a servicing income point of view matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thank you indiscernible terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks matt operator thank you our next question comes from bill carcache from wolfe research your line is now open terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks good morning bill andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp hey bill terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ph terry bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc assuming the fed hikes eventually lead to slower growth and higher unemployment as many hiking cycles have historically could you help us understand at what point youd be required to increase your reserve rate because that increase in unemployment would fall under your reasonable and supportable forecast period under cecl does it just need to be more visible before you can act on it us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i think theres a lot of uncertainty out there which direction its actually going to go i think there just needs to be more certainty around what that economic outlook is again kind of coming back to what i mentioned earlier bill we look at a whole variety of different economic outlooks and then we weight them and we have been for some period of time kind of weighting them a little bit more on the downside expecting because of the uncertainty that weve been talking about in the past so if a recession hits we will have to adjust it but thats something well have to take into consideration at that time bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and maybe following up on that how much of an impact would you say management overlays are having currently many banks have had their reserve rates fall below their day one levels already and theres a view that the macro outlook today is not as favorable as it was on january just curious to what extent overlays are being used indiscernible to the extent which youd consider using them terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah i mean i cant speak for what other people are doing what i will speak to is that if you end up looking at the reserve rate on day one versus today the change in that is really probably a couple of different factors but its principally the mix of the portfolio today versus what it was two years ago both in terms of the quality of the asset but also where we have seen growth over the last couple of years abs securities as an example securities lending as an example is very high quality thats where we have seen quite a bit of growth over the last couple of years and so a lot of its mix for us as much as anything i would say from an economic perspective relative to certainly day one its probably more on the downside than it was then so its i mean again i cant speak to what other people are doing but its really mixdriven for us bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats helpful and if i can squeeze in one last one you guys have a unique view given the depth of your consumer and commercial businesses maybe could you price out for us what a mild recession you think would look like maybe where you see the greatest risk on both the commercial and consumer side and then specifically within usb what that looks like indiscernible andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp well bill i yeah i think the greatest impacts will be on the low and moderate income customer base starting there and thats where inflation impacts the most and thats where were already starting to see some shift in spend as we talked about from discretionary to nondiscretionary and i think as that continues that will youll see more of an impact there but the spend levels continue to be good as we talked about i will tell you one change that we are seeing for the last two and a half years every month consumer balances checking and savings account balances have risen every single month we did see sort of a flattening in the last two months so thats moderating for sure so some of that excess savings certainly is not growing but its us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 flattening and starting to be spent so i think as that continues that provides a cushion as we go into the next few months but that cushion is starting to at least flatten out so those are the things were seeing and again as a reminder we dont have our portfolio is prime only our customer base is high quality so i think some of those early indicators or its early impacts will not be seen in our balance sheet terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah and then on the corporate side we have very little leverage lending thats just not an area that we get into our corporate customers are good investmentgrade customers so they have certainly the ability to withstand especially a mild recession bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thats super helpful and andy maybe going back to your comment around the significant liquidity that the consumers have and how thats kind of been coming down a little bit but its still high is that something that you think perhaps is maybe contributing to the strength in the spending and potentially could be sort of inflationary in and of itself and lead the fed to have to do more in terms of hiking just curious just your highlevel thoughts on that andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i think thats one of the wildcards or factors that we talked about were seeing things in todays environment that we havent seen in other downturns or recessionary impacts and i think this is one of them so we had trillions of dollars of government stimulus unemployment and the fact that people werent spending given the pandemic for a number of quarters and years and that built up a cushion and that cushion certainly is impacting spend levels because now they are using it and thats that trillion of excess savings and for us it is that high balance that were seeing across every level of deposits to to up to so still well above prepandemic levels but certainly flattening out and i think that cushion provides a little bit of time certainly before you start to see some of the impacts from this higher rate environment because people are spending money they already have bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you so much andy and terry andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp thanks bill us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 operator thank you and our final question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now open andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp good morning ebrahim terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey morning just one quick question on slide on the payments business andy and terry so you talked about just what might happen in the next few quarters but talk to us when we think about the business in the medium to longer term a lot of the digital native companies are struggling right now what this means in terms of the investments youve made over the last few years to gain market share should we anticipate any kind of strategic ma that helps you further your footprint within the payments business and just how that business should evolve relative in the pie chart and the breakdown you provided on slide would love to hear your thoughts thank you andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp so i think what we talked about is building this capability this ecosystem of banking and payments and weve already made a number of smaller acquisitions talech being one of them travelbank being another that have built our capabilities and thinking about helping companies manage their entire business from a receivables a payables standpoint money movement lending activity cash flows and such so the acquisitions that youve seen us make is to do exactly that that coupled with the investments weve made is whats driving that what we think is a great opportunity to build relationships and build revenue within those relationships and thats driving to terrys articulation of that high singledigit growth terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp yeah indiscernible terrance r dolan a chief financial officer vice chairman us bancorp ebrahim i would say that if we have a focus from an acquisition point of view in the near term it will be something thats very specific to a product or a capability that were trying to fill in but quite honestly we feel pretty good in terms of where were at right now us bancorp usb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 15jul2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and would you expect that over the next year or two you gaining market share in the business and what im trying to do is just handicap disruption risk to that business its something thats on the mind of investors and it seems like youre making good progress but would love to hear how you think about where your market share would be if you had to ph draw out over the medium term relative to today andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp yeah i do think we have the opportunity i think we have two great opportunities one is we have a big slew of banking customers ph and its in another chart who dont have our payments capabilities yet and we have half of our payments customers dont have our banking so we have a great opportunity to provide more products and services to those customers thats number one and number two is given the capabilities in this ecosystem were building we have the opportunity to acquire more customers which we believe will take share ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks andrew j cecere a chairman president chief executive officer us bancorp thank you operator and speakers we have no further questions at this time
