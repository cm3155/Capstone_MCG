highlights of our performance and then i will turn the call over to bryan mckeag heartlands chief financial officer who will provide more details on the financials let me start by sharing a very strong quarter of organic loan growth exclusive of acquisition activities following the third quarters strong organic loan growth in our ci and cre portfolios of million we delivered million of organic loan growth during the fourth quarter and million of organic loan growth for the year in our ci and cre portfolios this organic loan growth represents annualized organic growth for the quarter and annualized organic growth in the second half of our ag portfolio decreased million for the quarter and million for the year our strong commercial growth came from a healthy mix of expansion of existing relationships and winning against competitors during the fourth quarter we acquired new commercial lending relationships we have momentum and strong pipelines and we expect continued growth in these loan portfolios in our residential and consumer loan portfolios decreased million on a combined basis for the quarter and million for the full year primarily due to exiting the mortgage origination business in most of our markets and the current mortgage refinancing environment turning to deposits we had a stellar year and a strong quarter of organic deposit growth this quarter nontime organic deposit growth totaled million and we delivered an impressive million in organic nontime deposit growth in the quarters growth was largely driven by retail which included a yearend deposit of million from a longtime customer who sold their business the entire amount of this deposit is not expected to remain during the fourth quarter we added more than new consumer relationships and in our targeted consumer acquisition effort helped us increase the average balance in new consumer accounts to compared to a year ago we are enriching our retail customer experiences in branch via phone and in our digital channels during the fourth quarter we completed the implementation of technology that enables instant issue of debit cards in our banking centers we upgraded our call center technology platform and in addition to providing stronger authentication we are delivering more convenient selfservice options lastly we continued to advance our digital capabilities and we have added apple pay google pay and samsung pay to our electronic payment capabilities our deposit mix remains enviable with in noninterest heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 bearing accounts and in nontime account balances we continue to focus on deposit pricing and have realized quarteroverquarter savings of basis points we will continue to be proactive and we will be disciplined yet competitive in our deposit pricing turning to key credit metrics i am pleased to report that we continue to see stable credit quality our nonperforming loans represented basis points of total loans at the end of the fourth quarter compared to basis points at the end of the third quarter overall nonperforming assets as a percent of total assets were basis points at the end of the fourth quarter other real estate representing million of the million of total nonperforming assets the fourth quarter to 89day delinquency ratio was similar to prior quarters at basis points nonpass rated loans improved to from last quarter net loan chargeoffs for the quarter were or basis points this is our best performance in the past several quarters and lastly representing a greater than improvement from net chargeoffs were basis points for the full year next i would like to share the significant progress weve made across our strategic initiatives as we have discussed on previous calls beginning in we initiated and completed several streamlining activities across the company from which we realized over million of gains in in addition as you have also heard on previous calls we have reinvested over half or about million of those gains into a companywide initiative called operation customer compass operation customer compass is focused on improving our people processes and technology the combination of these activities has enhanced our profitability improved our efficiency and ultimately provides superior customer experiences these initiatives which began about months ago are now delivering significant operating leverage as evidenced by salary and benefit expenses have consistently been in the million to million range for the past eight quarters in they were up just second during this timeframe our full time equivalent employee count has declined by or from a high of in the second quarter of to at the end of and third occupancy and ffe expense has consistently been in the million to million per quarter range over the last eight quarters and was essentially flat for full year all of this was achieved in the same timeframe that we completed three acquisitions we grew assets by billion or we improved our efficiency ratio basis points from back in q2 to this quarter and we accelerated organic deposit and loan growth as evidenced by the strong performance in the second half of we have built momentum and operating leverage and well continue to deliver strong organic growth and improve our efficiency ratio we expect our efficiency ratio to move below in next i would like to give you an update on our initiatives to implement the bestinclass salesforce and ncino technology platforms these new tools will significantly improve our ability to deliver exceptional customer experiences they will enhance the sales process and improve the efficiency of our commercial sales teams improve back office functions and shorten sales cycles earlier this month we successfully launched these new tools in two banks and will roll them out to the rest of the organization by mid2020 we believe these significant investments in technology combined with our outstanding teams and our organic and acquired growth strategy position us better than ever before to excel before i turn the call over to bryan mckeag i would like to share that on november illinois bank trust completed the acquisition of the assets of rockford bank trust next week we will complete the systems conversion and jeff hultman and tom budd will take the helm of heartlands ph seventh bank to exceed billion in assets and control the number one market share in the rockford msa heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 lastly i would like to welcome dan stevens executive vice president and chief operations officer and jay kim executive vice president and general counsel to the heartland executive leadership team these additions to the heartland leadership team are a continuation of a multiyear comprehensive succession plan with that ill turn the call over to bryan mckeag for more detail on our quarter and yearend financial results bryan r mckeag chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon ill start my comments today by referencing the press release which shows our reported earnings per share of this quarter for the quarter noncore items consisted of a net writeoff writedown of assets totaling million marelated costs of and a reversal of loan servicing rights valuation expense of earnings were solid again this quarter and financial trends and metrics were positive in almost all aspects starting with the strong and liquid balance sheet which grew million this quarter and includes organic loan and deposit growth bruce discussed in his comments and of course the completed acquisition of rockford bank and trust as a result total assets ended the quarter at approximately billion with a tangible common equity ratio of just over and a loantodeposit ratio of investments grew million this quarter and comprised of assets with a tax equivalent yield of a duration of just under six years and generate over million of cash flow per month when combined with total borrowings of only million or of assets heartlands capital liquidity and leverage positions all remain in great shape and provide great flexibility to pursue growth strategies and opportunities going forward the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans increased basis point for the quarter to as mentioned in previous quarters we have billion of loans from recent acquisitions that are covered by valuation and pci reserves totaling million or excluding these loans from total loans would result in an allowancetoloans ratio of moving to the income statement net interest income totaled million this quarter up million compared to the prior quarter the increase was primarily driven by strong nontime deposit growth together with lower deposit costs the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis this quarter was which was at the lower end of the to range we indicated last quarter the decline of basis points from last quarter is primarily due to lower loan yields which included lower purchase accounting accretion offset by higher investment portfolio yields and lower interest costs on deposits which decreased basis points compared to last quarter this quarter the net interest margin includes basis points of purchase accounting accretion compared to basis points in the prior quarter the provision for loan losses was million this quarter down slightly from last quarters provision of million and was at the top end of the expected normal range of million to million noninterest income totaled million for the past quarter down million from last quarter compared to last quarter the gain on sale of loans was down million and gain on sale of securities was down million we also recorded as i mentioned a reversal on the valuation of loan servicing rights which reflect lower prepayment speeds on our mortgages moving to the noninterest expense total noninterest expense was million this quarter or flat compared to last quarter this quarter ma and system conversionrelated costs totaled compared to million last heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 quarter core run rate costs that exclude ma costs tax credit costs and asset gains and losses were million compared to million last quarter or a decrease this level of core costs was slightly above the million to million range we indicated last quarter more specifically salary and benefits were flat compared to last quarter as lower costs due to head count reductions were offset by higher bonus and incentive accruals professional fees decreased primarily due to marelated costs in this category that were lower than last quarter other noninterest expense was down with related to lower ma costs the remaining categories in expenses were flat compared to last quarter the efficiency ratio improved basis points this quarter to from last quarter reflecting improvements in both revenue and expenses the reported effective tax rate for the quarter was compared to last quarter the reduction was primarily due to the release of million of deferred tax valuation allowances for capital losses that were realized for tax purposes on the exit from two historical rehab partnerships during the quarter on a fullyear basis the effective tax rate improved basis points to for compared to for next ill summarize some of our thoughts for heartland excluding any additional acquisitions as we enter into commercial loan growth is projected to be in the midsingle digits on an annualized percentage basis ag and consumer loans will likely remain flat while residential mortgages are expected to continue to decline nontime deposit growth is expected to be in the low to midsingle digits on an annualized basis the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis is expected to begin to stabilize next quarter into the to range and then remain in the to range the rest of this assumes no rate moves by the fed in and includes the continued accretion of the remaining valuation reserves on the billion of acquired loans post cecl provision for loan losses under cecl are expected to decline and should generally range from million to million per quarter with quarterly fluctuations reflecting the level of organic loan growth and assumes that both macroeconomic forecasts and credit quality remain stable in service charges and fee growth is expected to be in the upper single digits on an annualized basis from recent postdurbin levels as continued strong growth in credit card revenue and growth in nontime deposits is expected in gain on sale of loans is expected to be slightly lower yearoveryear on lower anticipated refinance activity and quarterly fluctuations will follow normal seasonal patterns core expenses are expected to increase slightly over and should help drive the efficiency ratio into the to range for the full year however as you would expect our q1 efficiency ratio will likely go into the to range due to fewer business days in q1 and various accrual resets that occur at the start of the new year the effective tax rate excluding tax credit activities is expected to be in the range lastly we have made significant progress on cecl and are nearing completion however we still have a few items to complete in q1 to finalize our implementation with that in mind our current estimate of the increase to the beginning allowance for credit losses from the implementation of cecl is in the to range the range reflects some remaining uncertainty regarding three items first finetuning of macroeconomic forecasts second the impact of potential model validation refinements and third and most significant the impact of the recently acquired rockford bank and trust loan portfolio the two primary drivers of the increase relate to additions to additional allowances for unfunded lending commitments as cecl now requires an allowance for the expected utilization by borrowers over the life of those commitments and second and most significant is the establishment of an allowance for the billion of acquired loans which did not have any allowance under the previous accounting rules we expect a relatively heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 modest net change to the current level of allowances on the remaining legacy loan portfolio in addition the increased allowance will result in a reduction to beginning retained earnings net of deferred tax in the million to million range and will decrease the tce ratio to basis points with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from mr andrew liesch with piper sandler please proceed with your question andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co good afternoon everyone lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi andrew bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi andrew bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi andrew andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hi bryan could you just walk us through a little bit more on that core run rate expense number what exactly are you backing out there to get down there does that include some of the asset writedowns that may have come to that line and then what was the was there any sort of a tax adjustment or tax amortization expense in operating costs bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah so in the operating costs i back out the ma costs i referred to the back out the million of asset gains and then see the third item is the i think its the tax cost of our credits and that you can we do have that in our i think its a little over million if you look in our reconciliation of the efficiency ratio you can find that number andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay got you heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc those are the three items i back out andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful and then i know its kind of nitpicky just with classifieds basically being a little bit lower but just the rise in nonperformers just kind of curious what drove that and what you guys are seeing in the agriculture space right now andrew e townsend a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc sure this is drew the first piece that impacted us a little bit here andrew was we had million slightly greater in over days that hit us right at the end of the year im happy to report all of that has either been paid or resolved down to a very minimal number the second piece would be rockford bank trust it wasnt a big number a little north of million i believe in nonperformers and then we did have two larger credits agri related in our wisconsin bank that totaled in excess of million so those were the three drivers again as i mentioned the greater than days have effectively been resolved already as it relates to ag we were doing a little bit of discussion here in of our net chargeoffs were ag related and again by comparison ag is about of our total book and another metric to focus on of our npas right now are agoriented so you can certainly see a disparity there and the last comment i would make is as we have gone through the cecl process we are seeing better expected commodity prices as we look forward and thats part of our economic forecast but it remains a challenging space as we move into andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got you that detail is very helpful i will step back thanks for taking my questions andrew e townsend a chief credit officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah operator thank you our next question is from mr jeff rulis with da davidson your line is now open please proceed with your question jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thanks good afternoon lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi jeff heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi jeff bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hey jeff jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co bryan so the million core in expenses and in your prepared i think you kind of veered that towards the efficiency ratio on the guidance but could you bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co any way you could range bound what happens to core that million on a quarterly run rate then bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah obviously looking out quarters i think its going to stay up just slightly for the year when we get our rbt sic rbt and everything else going but its not going to go up a lot i think next quarter it should stay plus or minus where it was i would say between million and million is probably a good range we do have some then salaries start to go up and a couple of other things in the second quarter but revenue should pick up then as well so thats why i think the efficiency ratio can improve as we go forward once we get out of the first quarter which is always kind of a challenge jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so obviously the big number was the tax credit bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co expense and i guess if you exclude this onetime ph ma and asset gains then youre back in that range got you thank you bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 yeah jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and then on the organic loan growth just in the quarter drilling down a little bit obviously you talked about ci and cre being outstanding and bruce i think you mentioned runoff in the ag portfolio could we assume the other runoff was in the resi portfolio bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc the vast majority was resi we actually grew our consumer portfolio in the fourth quarter jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay yeah bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc slightly jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co and to that dynamic of you led with the ci cre in the i guess midsingle digits is there something inside of that if you look at a flat ag and consumer and down resi would be something inside of that for a net growth for the full year bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah i think net growth is probably in that mid to lower single digits but i would say mid probably because bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc were very heavily commercial loanoriented so i think we still should be in that midsingledigit area bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 yeah we think that the ci and cre should really be similar range that we were in the back half of and again we would expect consumer to be flat ag realistically probably is going to be down as we continue to work through credits and the industry and the resi portfolio is really going to depend on what interest rates do whether well keep those on our books or theyll get refinanced out jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co great and then last one i just wanted to make sure i had the right number bryan on the margin if you add i think youve referenced is that core number at versus is that aligned with the bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yes jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yes youve got it right jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah the basis points were down of it was in the purchase accounting so the other was in core yes jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thats all i had thank you operator thank you our next question comes from mr terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good evening everyone lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc hi terry heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc hi terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc bryan if i could just start with a cecl question does the credit mark on the now i guess the pcd loans does any of that migrate into the acl postcecl and is that captured at all in the outlook you discussed earlier on the call bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah the reserve that we carry for pci loans today will move over into the allowance the other we believe will be will remain to be amortized as weve been doing historically terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and a question for bruce its tough for us as outsiders to see the progress on operation customer compass you talked about the increase in new commercial relationships last quarter and i guess could you put that in perspective is that number higher than in prior quarters and is any of that a reflection of salesforce ncino and what youre doing to strengthen and build out that platform bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i would say the last two quarters have been very strong and that number would fit into that for us anything north of is pretty strong from a new relationship standpoint and really whats driven that in the last half of this year has not necessarily been salesforce or ncino yet its really been the sales management process that david prince has put in place as well as a much more targeted calling effort as opposed to kind of a shotgun approach its been very targeted in most of our markets and were starting to see the benefit of that where we will see the benefit longer term of salesforce and ncino will give us we think an extra couple of basis points couple of percentages of growth because we believe long term it will shorten the sales cycle about which for us is four to five days so that speed to market between the initial contact through underwriting through approval and through documentation we think that timeframe will be shortened up with the new technology that enables us to have a better 360degree view of the customer and have more people working in the technology at the same time terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc perfect and then ill ask the ma question could you just comment on level of conversations pricing expectations among some of the parties that youre talking with and i guess thoughts in the first half of on announcing another bank acquisition heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc yeah were close to a couple deals as you know the multiples on the buyers stock are what drive the prices and fortunate for us weve been able to work with banks that weve had relationships for some time that would like to be part of heartland and our model and they like our financial performance over time so yeah i really think youll be happy as we go through the year with the announcements of new partners for heartland terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks everyone bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah thanks terry bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from mr damon delmonte with cbw sic kbw please proceed with your question damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good afternoon guys how is it going today indiscernible damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good good to hear so first question if we could just circle back on the margin real quick bryan i think you said youre looking for to range here in the first quarter and then down to the to as we progress through how much of that is from lower accretable yield versus core compression bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc i would expect probably of each if i were to kind of thats what happened this last quarter i would say thats potentially what will happen purchase accounting we can have a little bit more turnover in that portfolio it can bump up and then come back down but i think what ive seen and butch and bruce you guys can jump in but when i looked at loan pricing if i went back to midjune that loan pricing is down to basis points from where it was half a year ago but if you look at our deposit price its only down about so weve got to really work on the deposit side and even if we do that its still going to be hard to maintain the margin so i think theres going to be a little bit of erosion there and probably a little bit on the purchase heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 accounting side as that naturally runs away and we wont replace nearly as much on future acquisitions under cecl damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc there is an opportunity because we are so liquid damon with the loantodeposit ratio if we can be effective of generating more loans i mean were still earning just a little under in our bond portfolio on a fully taxable equivalent basis but if we can convert into loans that will certainly help us hold margin bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah lynn b fuller a executive operating chairman heartland financial usa inc and well have to be diligent as bryan said on continuing to reduce our deposit cost damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and then and kind of along those lines with that liquidity the securities portfolio did increase this quarter so can we expect it to not get much bigger than this or would you look to put more leverage on it bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc yeah we wouldnt leverage to put anything in the investment book the only way the investment would grow is if as bruce butch said we dont get the loan growth and we get the deposit growth so otherwise i dont think youll see it get any bigger it should come down as were able to go the other way hopefully bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah i dont think damon that youll see us put leverage on through the investment portfolio based upon what we think our pipelines look like as well as that one large deposit which we dont believe that well maintain we should be able to increase our loantodeposit ratio over the next couple of quarters damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc and the other thing damon i would just tell you that were thinking is given where the investment portfolio yields today if we drive our deposit rates down and slow that deposit growth a bit if that happens we may choose to heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2020 take on a little bit of leverage because we have so little rather than sell off the investment portfolio and take gains today to give up higher yielding assets so we kind of have to wait and see how it plays out but wed really rather not put on a leverage and rather just grow the core customer base damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats all i really had most of my other questions have been answered so thank you bryan r mckeag a chief financial officer executive vice president heartland financial usa inc great bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks damon operator thank you and speakers there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to mr fuller for closing comments lynn b fuller executive operating chairman
