officer american express co thank you steve and good morning everyone its good to be here to talk about the first quarter results which reflect another quarter of strong results and are tracking in line with the guidance we gave for the full year starting with our summary financials on slide first quarter revenues were billion and grew year overyear this revenue momentum drove reported net income of billion and earnings per share of on slide billed business grew versus last year in the first quarter on an fxadjusted basis in line with the overall spend environment we have seen in the past few quarters as we expected looking by category we saw growth in goods and services spending and growth in travel and entertainment spending there are a few other key points to takeaway as we then breakdown our spending trends across our businesses starting with our largest segment on slide us consumer grew billings at this quarter with growth across all generations and age cohorts millennial and gen z customers grew their spending and continued to drive our highest billed business growth within this segment in fact we see that younger customers use their cards more overall and this is even more pronounced in certain spend categories for example customers aged and under use their cards at restaurants over more on average than other customers in this segment looking at commercial services on slide overall growth came in at this quarter spending growth from our us small and medium size enterprise customers remain modest given unique dynamics seen by small businesses lastly on slide you see our highest growth again this quarter in international card services up we continue to see doubledigit growth in spending from international consumers and from international sme and large corporate customers as well as strong growth across our geographies overall while we do continue to see a softer spend environment our spending volumes are tracking in line with our expectations to support our revenue guidance for the full year and we are pleased with a continued strong engagement of our customers as the number of transactions from our card members continued to grow double digits this quarter american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 now moving on to loans and card members receivables on slide we saw yearoveryear growth at as we progress through we continue to expect this growth to moderate but to still grow modestly faster than billings turning next to credit and provision on slide through first and most importantly we continue to see strong and bestinclass credit metrics we attribute this performance to the high credit quality of our customer base our robust risk management practices and our disciplined growth strategy as we expected our writeoff and delinquency rates ticked up a bit increasing very modestly quarteroverquarter going forward we expect to see these delinquency and writeoff rates remain strong with some continued modest increase in turning now to the accounting of this credit performance on slide the quarteroverquarter growth in our loan balances combined with a modest increase in our card member loans and receivables delinquency rate resulted in a million reserve build this reserve build combined with net writeoffs drove billion of provision expense in the first quarter as you see on slide we ended the first quarter with billion in reserves representing of our total loans and card member receivables we continue to expect this reserve rate to increase a bit as we move through similar to the modest increases weve seen over the past few quarters moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the first quarter our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in q1 on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide this growth is mostly driven by the spending trends we discussed earlier net card fees revenues were up yearoveryear in the first quarter on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide we are pleased with this growth and continue to expect to exit the year with some further momentum reflecting our cycle of product refreshes in the quarter we acquired million new cards demonstrating the demand were seeing for our products and the investments weve made importantly acquisition of our premium feebased products accounted for around of new accounts and the spend revenue and credit profiles of our new card members continue to look strong moving on to slide you can see that net interest income was up yearoveryear in q1 this growth is driven by the increase in our revolving loan balances and also by continued net yield expansion versus last year we do expect this growth to continue to moderate as we move through the year and i would remind you that for our business model we would not expect to see a meaningful impact from a lower interest rate environment this year to sum up revenues on slide the power of our diversified model continues to drive strong revenue growth momentum i would note as you think about the cfpb late fee rule that late fees from our us consumer segment make up a small portion less than of our overall revenue while we have no specific plans to mitigate as of now we are always looking at our pricing and policies in the ordinary course of business moving to expenses on slide starting at the top of the page variable customer engagement expenses came in at of total revenues for the first quarter as you look at these costs i would note that card member rewards included a million benefit as a result of enhancements to our remodels for estimating future membership rewards redemptions some of which we reinvested for growth in our marketing line american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 looking forward i still expect our variable customer engagement expenses to grow slightly higher than our revenue on a fullyear basis as we continue to focus on our premium products and drive engagement from our card members on the marketing line we increased investments to billion in the first quarter we continue to be pleased with a strong highquality customer acquisition and engagement we see as a result of these actions and we are on track to increase marketing spend in versus last year moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the first quarter flat to last years expense and in line with our expectations for the year when you look at the components of our operating expenses salaries and benefit grew modestly versus last year compared to the growth weve seen in this line over the past years this reflected discipline with which we manage our expenses and is a great example of how were able to drive efficiency while continuing to grow our business we continue to see opex as a key source of leverage and are focused on delivering low levels of growth as we have historically done turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the first quarter on the back of strong earnings generation our cet1 ratio was at the end of the first quarter within our target range of to we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth we do not expect any material nearterm changes to our capital management approach that brings me to our guidance on slide we feel really good about our first quarter results which are tracking in line with our expectations for the year these results continue to reinforce that our strategy is working and we plan to continue to invest to support our momentum as steve discussed for the full year we are reaffirming our guidance of having revenue growth of to and earnings per share between and and we remain committed to running the business for the long term as a reminder this guidance and the items related to the full year that i just walked through do not include the potential impact from the sale of our certified business that we previously announced we expect to realize a sizable gain on the sale and to reinvest a substantial portion of the gain back into our business as weve done with similar transactions in the past we still expect the deal to close in the second quarter and plan to provide more detail then with that ill turn the call back over to kartik to open up the call for your questions kartik ramachandran senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you christophe before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani with kbw please proceed with your question sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning i guess a question for both steve and christophe christophe you said that you guys are seeing a softer spending environment im just curious when you look at the data whats driving that is it inflation is it just a bit of tapering off after the postpandemic spending and im just curious as we think about what gets that going again what is it obviously the comparisons get easier as well so that should help but maybe you could just walk through that thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah let me start and then christophe can jump in but when you look at overall spending our overall spending is but consumer spending is and i think consumer spending is relatively strong and when you look at international international consumer spending is up and overall international is up where youre seeing some softness is in sme so sme is up approximately and so i think as sme comes back which we look at as an opportunity down the road as sme comes back thatll drive some stronger spending and i think the good things that we see from an sme perspective is that were still acquiring cards credit looks really good and even though organic has come down organic transactions have gone up so i think in aggregate we see softness and i think a lot of that softness is driven from a commercial perspective but consumer growth in the us is not too bad operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia from bank of america please proceed with your question mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thanks for taking my question stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc i wanted to ask about the membership rewards expense it looks like theres a little bit of a change there with model announcements so can you just talk about that a little more did the estimate for the urr the redemption rates change from the at yearend should we think of this on a million benefit as a onetime thing or is that going to be the news american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co hey mihir thanks for the question so you should think about it as a onetime thing and the urr is its still at what we do is because its such an important model for us we on a regular basis redevelop the model and every time we redevelop the model we try to enhance the model so we feed the model with more data and try to refine their urr calculation thats exactly what happened and when we did that in q1 we came back with a little bit of the benefit i say a little bit because you have to remember that the entire membership rewards bank is about billion so its a bit less than billion so million is very small compared to the size of the balance sheet and so its a oneoff and we dont expect something similar any time soon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mark devries with deutsche bank please proceed with your question mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks could you discuss what drove the reacceleration in the new card growth this quarter stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so we invested more and i think when you go back and you look at the first quarter of last year we had billion million excuse me billion would be a pretty sizable amount of cards to acquire in the quarter million cards acquired and if you remember at that time you had the svb situation and so it was a pullback it was not only a pullback on our side there was a little bit of a pullback in the industry and i think there was some consumer trepidation as well and so as the year went on we started to build up and it culminated this year with in the first quarter of million cards we invested more in marketing as we said we were going to do but id also like to highlight that a key driver of that acceleration is the product refreshes that we do weve talked a lot how product refreshes really stimulate demand and how it makes our marketing dollars work a lot harder and so we had the delta product refreshes we had product refresh in japan we had a hilton small business card we had a british airways card and were on our way to those product refreshes that we talked about and what product refreshes do they do stimulate demand and it stimulates upgrades and so forth so thats really whats behind the increase sequentially of cards quarteroverquarter but were sort of back to where we were at this time last year christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co the only thing i would add mark is as we increase the mca the percentage of new cards that are coming at a feepaying product remains stable at about so it talks about the quality of these million new cards operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig maurer with ft partners please proceed with your questions craig maurer q analyst ft partners american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 yeah good morning thank you so wanted to ask about your assumptions on page of the deck it looks like for quarters the second and third quarter youre assuming a better macro scenario in the us so just curious in combination of the awards kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co please stand by we are waiting for our operator craig maurer q analyst ft partners sorry were you guys hearing me operator im here craig maurer q analyst ft partners okay sorry so what i was saying was with the what seems to be firmer macro assumptions for second and third quarter and the rewards benefit how come eps guide was held flat im assuming theres probably a bigger buffer in there and second if you could comment on what the trends have been in your loan workout program have you been seeing higher lower additions to that program and hows progress been in terms of getting consumers on good payment plans and maintaining them thanks operator american express speaker line are you guys there kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co operator can you confirm if you can hear us in the room operator i can hear you ladies and gentlemen please stand by well continue with the next question in just a moment kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co hello can you hear us operator hi i can hear you can you hear me kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co hello operator hi this is rob can you hear me american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co operator can you confirm if you can hear us now operator i can hear you darryl do you hear them hi this is i can hear everyone im not sure please stand by while we check into if were experiencing some technical difficulties kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co for folks attending the call we are going to dial back in so please stay on the line or if the call does drop we ask you to dial back in thank you technical difficulty operator ladies and gentlemen please remain on the line we will call will resume momentarily thank you operator you guys are back are you able to hear me kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co yes operator thank you please go ahead operator okay so that last question was from the line of craig maurer with ft partners craig you may have to ask your question again stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah we didnt hear it craig maurer q analyst ft partners no problem thanks and good morning again christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co morning craig maurer q analyst ft partners so wanted to ask about the assumptions later in the deck it looks like youre assuming a firmer economic environment for quarters two and three so taking that with the benefit on rewards should we assume theres a larger buffer built into your guide because you didnt raise eps guide and second along the same lines i wanted to ask about your loan workout program are you seeing any change in terms of the pace of loans being added or loans being worked out and how loans are progressing through that program thanks american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co okay hey good morning craig under how we think about the balance of the year so with i just want to say were going to stick to our eps guidance were not going to change that range at this point in time theres still a lot of things that need to play out in the balance of the year and we think that that guidance best represent what we expect at this point in time specifically about how to think about that urr benefit as ive said in my prepared remarks i would say that a significant portion of that benefit was reinvested on the marketing line we knew we saw that benefit coming in the quarter and we took advantage of that as well to dial up the marketing so all in all it doesnt have a meaningful impact on eps for the full year when it comes to the what we call the financial relief program and the modified loans so this is an important program for us we have we think one of the best program in the industry we have ph innovative for instance we have a shortterm program we are also in that shortterm program enabling the card members to retain some spend capacity and usage of the product so we really think that its a differentiator to help the card members that are experiencing stress so that program is working really well for us its very effective and what i can say is that the enrollment in the program has moderated in q1 and that the performance of the card members within this program is very very strong we have a ton of metrics one of the metrics weve talked about in the past was were looking at payment loyalty and how much the card members who are in delinquent status or paying us versus paying our peers and we like what were seeing right were typically front of their wallet in terms of repayments and its definitely contributing to the strong credit metrics that youve seen we think its also consistent with our brand in terms of being there for our card members and having their backs so that program is working well but just to be specific on your question the enrollment in this program is moderating in q1 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of john hecht with jefferies please proceed with your question john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys most of my questions have been asked so i guess im going to ask about the visa and mastercard settlement the reduction in interchange rates and then some steering mechanisms and i know historically given your premium brand and so forth those actions havent had any impact on the business but we havent talked about that for a while so im wondering if you guys just have some updated thoughts about that stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well its really hard to say how its going to play out over time i mean this has been going on probably close to years and it still has to be approved the courts and well see but what i would say is it really doesnt change sort of our strategy in any way were still focused on premium customers our customers still engage with the products well demand to use the products and well still maintain our virtual parity so well see how it all plays out but were going to continue to focus on what we control and the only other thing i would say is that our pricing is policies and structures are fundamentally different than the networks american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co operator operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for your patience in standing by our conference will resume momentarily were experiencing technical difficulties please remain on the line once again your conference will begin shortly thank you so much for joining us okay you are back in kartik ramachandran a senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co operator we can hear you can you go ahead with the next question please operator sure our next question comes from the line of jeff adelson with morgan stanley please proceed with your question jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning guys can you hear me okay stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah we can jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay good yeah just wanted to ask the prior comments you made last quarter about the card refresh plans for this year card products i think from a quick indiscernible and it seems like youve done eight so far this year with delta health and maybe a card in india is that right and maybe you can just talk a little bit about trajectory over the rest of the year cadence over the rest of the year and what the response has been to some of those refreshes so far i think more notably the big delta one you did earlier this year would be interested to hear the response youve seen from customers so far on that thank you stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah so the product refreshes will go out through the year we dont really talk about exactly when theyre going to be released but you can rest assured all or approximately will be done you know its a little early to tell on the refreshes as its still in the early stages here but what i would say from a delta reserve perspective it has really really gone well probably beyond our expectations so that is its a great product we raised the fee and added over worth of worth of value so thats going well and as i said the proof will be in the pudding because refreshes really do help to drive demand it drives awareness it not only and it drives more engagement with existing cardholders and its been a strategy that has worked very very well for us over the last number of years and its one that were committed to on a go forward basis american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 because its not only important to again drive demand but you really want to reignite and reengage with the base and what we really do is we look at what our customers really want and make sure that were adding that value that makes the most sense to them operator thank you our next question comes from the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please proceed with your question richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question and steve it ties in with what you were just talking about when we think about the lifecycle of a customer its acquisition its engagement and then ultimately its loyalty and retention and i think the real strength of american express is on the loyalty retention side when you talk about refresh thats acquisition and engagement can you talk about what youre doing investing on the back office side as the portfolios growing so quickly to make sure that you maintain the loyalty and retention aspect of the business as well stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think it truly is a virtuous cycle and i think youve got it right its important to obviously acquire cards and then as you acquire a card you really want to engage them and get those cardholders spending in as many areas as they can and so you look at this rampup period over maybe a to month period and then at that point in time whats important is that we are engaging with the customer as a customer who is embedded within the franchise and part of our marketing dollars not only goes to acquiring new customers but we look at how people are spending we look at how theyre spending relative to other people like them and thats where youll see offers to either upgrade cards line increases other products that we have and so its that constant engagement its the analytics that go behind it that really leads to the retention what you cannot do is once you have somebody you just cant let them be stagnant and so theres a lot of learning out of our commercial business and out of our merchant business where we have tremendous account managers and that work with our clients on a daily basis weekly basis to help them grow their spend now obviously with tens of millions of consumer card members you cant do that necessarily personally all the time but you can do that through communicating through the channels that we have and another big part of our value proposition and our service proposition is when people do call into us our customer care professionals are able to look at their spending look at how theyre doing and offer them other opportunities to really grow with us either from again from a lending perspective or from a card upgrade perspective so i think its really important what happens on that back office as that continues to fuel that virtuous cycle operator thank you our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please proceed with your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks good morning steve and christophe american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc although you mentioned christophe that the rewards benefit was oneoff are you seeing evidence of customers driving greater value from experiential and partnerfunded rewards i guess im just wondering if theres a possibility that pressure on the rewards rate could potentially abate in a sustained way as customers generate greater value in other ways stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so christophe can get a little bit more into the detail but i think you hit on a really good point and one that really is part of our value proposition whether its embedded value that we get from our partners thats embedded in the value proposition and were seeing that increase over time and thats also as you look at refreshes you see that within the refreshes but its also the amex offers and how we continue to work with our merchant partners to provide more benefits to our card members on an ongoing basis so i think when you take that entire portfolio of the rewards opportunities that we have the embedded value that comes within the value proposition and amex offers all of that together and it gets back to what ricks point was all of that together leads to more loyalty and more retention christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co and to build that a little bit on the rewards side we are constantly trying to innovate on the mr side on the number of partners engaged in the program the ease of redemption as well one of their latest innovation that is actually very successful in terms of how many card members are using it is the ability just to select a transaction on your statement your digital statement and actually use mr points to pay for that specific transactions and were seeing a lot of card members using that so we constantly trying to make it easier and better for our card members to redeem to make the product the mr program competitive and more and more economic as well for us so its definitely a place of innovation that is a very dynamic place operator thank you our next question comes from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo please proceed with your question donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yes christophe your international billed business growth continues to be very strong do you build that into your guidance at this level for revenue growth and can you give us an update on how your acceptance initiatives are going christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 yeah so we are ics and international was the fastestgrowing segment of american express precovid and has been for several quarters now as well the opportunity is just much bigger for us in international were also investing everything else being equal proportionately a bit more in international the brand out in international was probably a bit more premium as well than it is in the us so theres definitely a massive opportunity for us and were going after it and thats baked in our guidance for this year its also factored in as we think about our longterm aspiration part of the things that were going to do to deliver on that guidance for this year and the longterm aspiration is actually to grow at a faster pace in international its a great opportunity for us for sure stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so were going to talk more about international at investor day well have a separate segment on that but were also going to talk about how we continue to grow international coverage and if you remember a number of years ago we talked about our international city strategy we talked about industries were going after and so well provide some updates on that but the top line is international acceptance continues to grow and continues to improve and when you look at the international business growing at the rate its growing and coverage continuing to grow we see that as a long runway for future growth operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gus gala with monness crespi hardt sic monness crespi hardt co please proceed with your question gus gala q analyst monness crespi hardt co inc hi guys good morning thank you for taking my question wanted to dig in and ask can we talk about the opportunities to lower cost of funding and similar line of thought here can you talk a little bit about the pay over time feature thanks christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah so the pay over time you mean like how its performing how its growing pay over time gus gala q analyst monness crespi hardt co inc yeah the christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co yeah gus gala q analyst monness crespi hardt co inc lets talk about the performance and the unit economics if we can christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 yeah so pay over time is a facility that is available on our charge product its a service that a lot of card members are taking advantage of its the opportunity for them to revolve some of their transactions or part of their balance their performance is very strong its actually the segment of our balances that is the fastest growing and from a i would say from a performance standpoint because that product or that service is attached to our charge card products so typically premium card members the credit performance is also the best that we have in our lending product so its a very efficient way for us to grow balances by extending credit to premium card members and the first question i forgot was stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co funding mix christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co funding and so the funding mix is still its still evolving towards more deposits and as you know deposits is for us the most effective and the most economical source of fund and its a very stable source of fund as well for us i think we are at about of our deposit direct deposit balances are below the fdic cap so its a stable resilient growing source of funding for us and its generating a lot of good things for us including supporting our growth and growth plan and growth aspiration and when you look at the yield that i had on the lending slide one of the drivers behind the yield expansion yearoveryear is actually a more effective cost of fund and its not a oneoff right that has been a trend for several years now and there is more to come operator thank you our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch with td cowen please proceed with your question moshe orenbuch q analyst td cowen great thanks so much if you look at your commercial spending particularly sme growth its been particularly weak the last couple of quarters and were noticing on slide the goods and services has basically been flat to down for a couple of quarters and you mentioned things that are unique to small business but maybe could you expand that a little more and talk about what things we might see that would cause that to start to turn and how long you can kind of maintain the kind of teens growth in loans while that is kind of flattish if you could talk about those things thank you christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co all right let me start and im sure steve will add on to this so youre right i mean the sme billed business has been in that range for a year now we think that this is macro driven and we have a ton of data that confirms that its not specific to american express and the rest of the industry is experiencing similar trends i will note as i think we said in the prepared remarks that on the acquisition side its going very strongly so the demand for the product is there their quality of the applicant is there as well and as weve said in the past i would say the tenured base that is moderating their spend well see how it goes those card members the sme as weve said in the past have been going through a lot theyre certainly experiencing as well their compound effect of funding cost for several years now and theyre very careful in terms of how theyre managing their cash flows and how theyre spending american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 this being said we are very focused at working with them as i said engaging with them and were confident that we have what it takes to win them back when they are ready to spend more stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i think that moshe when you look at this the sme has been this entire space has been sort of disrupted over the last four years or so maybe five years with covid where it took a tremendous drop for months or so and then all of a sudden you had unbelievable unsustainable organic growth of like and in given years it was crazy growth in and and we saw last year after the first quarter it really started to wane and again i think theres again a few reasons for that theres tremendous buildup in inventories i think interest rates going up did not help from a small business perspective especially as they thought about purchasing goods and services and buying those goods and services and stocking them in anticipation of another supply chain formality or meltdown and what we do like is that our acquisition is still very strong the transactions even within the tenured base continue to go up its the larger transactions that where were really seeing organic decline on and a lot of that can be industry specific construction a lot of that can also be not buying big inventories upfront so i think whats important for us to focus on right now is to continue to acquire continue to work with them and engaging with them and then when theyre ready to come back were there for them as they want to spend even more as far as and i started the conversation with this as far as overall spending thats what makes me feel really good about our overall spending because were able to grow with our commercial business growing very low and small business only growing at and its an important part of the franchise and thats why we feel good because of the credit and of the new acquisition operator thank you our final question will come from the line of ryan nash with goldman sachs please proceed with your question ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co good morning christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so maybe to bring together some of the pieces of revenue growth i think you were at the high end the first quarter and i think christophe you said the expectation that nii was going to slow maybe just talk a little bit american express co axp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 about how you think about the trajectory the revenue growth do we need to see spend stabilize to remain in the range or can we see the impact of refreshes and card acquisitions be enough to stabilize revenue growth within the range on a quarterly basis thank you christophe le caillec a chief financial officer american express co so things are in q1 played out as we were expecting we billed business came in similar to what we experienced in the previous quarters card fee is moderating slightly from to fxadjusted growth rate and were still expecting that it will pickup a little bit in the balance of the year on the back of the things that you said including the card refreshes and acquiring a lot of premium cards and nii at is going to keep moderating but the balances are moderating so the guidance for the fullyear is still to be between and well see exactly how things play out there are still a lot of things to find out how the late payment charges are going to come in whats going to happen with the interest rates so best at this stage i think is to stick to the full year guidance of to and but i would say q1 validated the trends and the guidance that we gave at the beginning of the year kartik ramachandran senior vice
