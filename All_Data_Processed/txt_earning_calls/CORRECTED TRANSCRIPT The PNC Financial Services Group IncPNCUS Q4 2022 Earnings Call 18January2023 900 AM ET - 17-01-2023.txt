the call over to bill william stanton demchak chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc thanks bryan good morning everybody was a successful year for our company and our strong performance during the year reflects the power of our main street bank model and our coasttocoast franchise for the full year we reported billion in net income or per share inside of that we grew loans and generated record revenue during a rapidly rising rate environment while at the same time we controlled expenses resulting in substantial positive operating leverage for the full year turning to our results for the fourth quarter we generated billion of net income or per share growth in both net interest income and fee income contributed to a increase in revenue our expenses were up this quarter primarily due to increased compensation from elevated business activity particularly in our advisory businesses rob is going to provide more detail on our fourth quarter expenses as well as our outlook in a few minutes average loans grew during the quarter driven by growth in both commercial and consumer for the full year average loans were up and we continue to grow our loan book in a disciplined manner as we look ahead we are operating our company with the expectation for a shallow recession in accordingly this outlook drove an increase in our loan loss provision in the quarter and a modest build in reserves under the cecl methodology importantly as the credit environment continues to trend towards normalized levels our overall credit quality metrics remain solid id add that with chargeoffs having been so low its not surprising to see volatility quarter to quarter and we saw this in the fourth quarter with an outsized loss on one commercial credit pushing us outside of our expected range the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 we continue to manage our liquidity levels to support growth our deposits remain relatively stable and weve increased our wholesale borrowings to bolster liquidity during the quarter we returned billion of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends bringing our total annual capital return to billion our progress within the bbva influence markets continues to exceed our expectations and we see powerful growth opportunities across our lines of business in these new markets we continue to generate new customer relationships and we have been thrilled with the quality of bankers weve been able to hire in summary it was a solid fourth quarter as we further built on our postacquisition momentum delivered for our customers and communities across the country generated strong financial results for our shareholders and put ourselves in a position of strength as we move into as always i want to thank our employees for everything they do to make our success possible and with that ill turn it over to rob to provide more details rob robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis loans for the fourth quarter were billion an increase of billion or linked quarter investment securities grew billion or cash balances at the federal reserve totaled billion and declined billion during the quarter and our average deposit balances were down while periodend deposits remained essentially stable average borrowed funds increased billion as we proactively bolstered our liquidity with federal home loan bank borrowings late in the third quarter and these are reflected in our fourth quarter average balances on a spot basis we increased our total borrowed funds by approximately billion compared to september the periodend increase was driven by billion of fhlb borrowings and billion of senior debt partially offset by lower subordinated debt at yearend our tangible book value was per common share an increase of linked quarter and we remain well capitalized with an estimated cet1 ratio of as of december we continue to be well positioned with capital flexibility during the quarter we returned billion of capital to shareholders through approximately million of common dividends and million of share repurchases or million shares slide shows our loans in more detail compared to the same period a year ago average loans have increased or billion reflecting increased loan demand as well as our ability to capitalize on opportunities in our expanded coasttocoast franchise during the fourth quarter we delivered solid loan growth loan balances averaged billion an increase of billion or compared to the third quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans on a spot basis loans grew billion or commercial loans grew more than billion at periodend driven by strong broadbased new production in both our corporate banking and assetbased lending businesses importantly utilization rates within our cib portfolio remained stable linked quarter consumer loans increased billion compared to september driven by higher residential mortgage home equity and credit card balances partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields of increased basis points compared to the third quarter driven by higher interest rates the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 slide covers our deposits in more detail throughout deposit balances have declined modestly amidst the competitive pricing environment and inflationary pressures fourth quarter deposits averaged billion and were generally stable linked quarter given the rising interest rate environment we continue to see a shift in deposits from noninterestbearing into interestbearing and as a result at december our deposit portfolio mix was interestbearing and noninterest bearing overall our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased to during the fourth quarter and as of december our cumulative beta was slide details our securities portfolio on an average basis our fourth quarter securities of billion grew billion or the increase was largely driven by elevated purchase activity late in the third quarter which included billion of forward starting securities that settled in the fourth quarter on a spot basis securities were billion and increased billion or linked quarter the yield on our securities portfolio increased basis points to driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization and during the quarter new purchase yields exceeded at the end of the fourth quarter our accumulated other comprehensive income improved to billion reflecting the accretion of unrealized losses on securities and swaps importantly we continue to estimate that approximately of aoci will accrete back per quarter going forward without taking into account the impact of rate changes turning to the income statement on slide as you can see fourth quarter reported net income was billion or per share revenue was up million or compared with the third quarter expenses increased million or provision was million in the fourth quarter reflecting the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth which resulted in a million reserve build and our effective tax rate was turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends in total revenue was a record billion and grew or billion compared to within that net interest income increased due to both higher interest rates and strong loan growth noninterest income declined as lower marketsensitive fees more than offset strong card and cash management growth looking more closely at the fourth quarter total revenue was billion an increase of or million linked quarter net interest income of billion was up million or the benefit of higher yields on interest earning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs and as a result net interest margin increased basis points to fee income was billion and increased million or linked quarter looking at the detail asset management and brokerage fees decreased million or reflecting the impact of lower average equity markets capital markets and advisory revenue grew million or driven by higher merger and acquisition advisory fees partially offset by lower loan syndication activity lending and deposit services increased million or primarily due to higher loan commitment fees reflecting our strong new loan production residential and commercial mortgage revenue increased million driven by higher rmsr valuation adjustments partially offset by lower commercial mortgage banking activities other the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 noninterest income declined million linked quarter reflecting a negative fourth quarter visa fair value adjustment compared to a positive valuation adjustment in the third quarter resulting in a change of million turning to slide our fourth quarter expenses were up million or linked quarter the growth was largely in personnel costs which increased million reflecting higher variable compensation related to increased business activity fourth quarter personnel costs also included market impacts on longterm incentive compensation plans as well as seasonally higher medical benefits the remaining balance of the increase in expenses linked quarter included higher marketing spend as well as impairments on various assets and investments the majority of these impairments will lower our expenses going forward and are included in our expense guidance as you know we had a goal of million in cost savings through our continuous improvement program and we exceeded that goal looking forward to we will be increasing our annual cip goal to million this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans of billion decreased million or compared to september and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies of billion declined million or linked quarter net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million an increase of million linked quarter driven in part by one large commercial loan credit our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans was basis points in the fourth quarter provision for the fourth quarter was million compared to million in the third quarter the increase reflected the impact of a weaker economic outlook as well as continued loan growth during the fourth quarter our allowance for credit losses increased million and our reserves now total billion or of total loans in summary pnc reported a strong fourth quarter and full year in regard to our view of the overall economy were now expecting a mild recession in resulting in a decline in real gdp our rate path assumption includes a basis point increase in fed funds in both february and march following that we expect the fed to pause rate actions until december when we expect a basis point cut looking ahead our outlook for full year compared to results is as follows we expect spot loan growth of to which equates to average loan growth of to total revenue growth to be to inside of that our expectation is for net interest income to be up in the range of to and noninterest income to be stable to up expenses to be up between and and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately based on this guidance we expect well generate solid positive operating leverage in looking at first quarter of compared to fourth quarter of we expect spot loans to be stable which equates to average loan growth of to net interest income to be down to reflecting two fewer days in the quarter fee income to be down to due to seasonally lower first quarter client activity other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities and visa activity we expect total noninterest expense to be down to and we expect first quarter net chargeoffs to be approximately million and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning john william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc on the net interest income side wanted to see if you can give us a little more thought around the deposit costs potentially maybe if you can give us your updated thoughts on where the cumulative beta i know youre in that or just over now robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc right john pancari q analyst evercore group llc where that could trend to whats your updated expectation there and then also maybe on the noninterest bearing mix i know its of total deposits now how do you expect that trending over the course of the next year thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc why dont you go ahead go ahead robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure why dont i take the second one first in terms of the mix consistent with our expectations in a rising rate environment we expect the mix to go more into interestbearing and were seeing that but its right on track no big surprise there were right now at noninterestbearing id imagine that over the course of itll go down a bit our previous low in previous cycles was around so i think thats a good way to sort of think about it the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 in terms of the betas youre right we finished the year right on top of where we expected as you know betas lagged past historical increases for most of for us and for the industry and going forward we expect maybe that lag to sort of compress a bit and well start tracking to historical rises but nothing particularly unusual and of course we dont control that thatll be an outcome william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey john if youre trying to dig into i had made a comment at goldman that we thought our nii might track to an annualized fourth quarter and in our guide we look a little light to that all of that pressure its not coming from funding its coming from the spread on loans so where weve been surprised ive been surprised is we just havent seen spreads widen in corporate credit so i guess what i would say to you is theres this disconnect and something is going to give either corporate spreads are going to widen or our current scenario that we have forecasted for cecl is wrong so right now we basically guide against kind of where spreads are maybe we get some widening and we put this mild recession in cecl so we have a little bit of disconnect in the numbers but they are what they are robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah and that gets of course to our guidance for the full year in terms of nii so the upside would be to bills point that loan spreads would widen as they should if we get into the economy that everybody is prepared for william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah john pancari q analyst evercore group llc so that widening would provide upside to that to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so none of the change in kind of thought on nii is driven by any change in our assumption on betas or deposit growth we had pretty healthy deposits this quarter we think we can continue that its all on this we have an ability particularly in the new markets to grab a whole bunch of new clients make new loans that are good credit loans kind of invest into this as weve done in our new markets for years invest into client growth the problem is the return right now struggles because we havent seen spreads gap the way weve seen in the public markets the way we might expect given the economy were kind of forecasting john pancari q analyst evercore group llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 got it okay thanks bill and then separately on the credit side can you give us a little more color on the million increase in chargeoffs what was the size of the commercial credit what was the industry are you seeing any other developments related to that credit or other areas of your portfolio were flagging just given the lumpiness in the size of that one issue thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean you can jump in here rob that one credit has been staring us in the face for a while weve been working on it its a credit that both bbva and pnc were in so it shows up as outsized we had big reserves against it as youve seen in our nonperformers and our delinquencies there going down this is kind of i dont know what you call this something going through a snake but weve been staring at it and we charged it off and thats showing the elevation this quarter but i wouldnt read into that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah no underlying trend or anything problematic with the asset category john pancari q analyst evercore group llc what was that industry robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc telecommunications john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay all right thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is from the line of john mcdonald with autonomous research please go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 hi good morning rob wanted to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hi john john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research just follow up on the nii questions from john there can you just remind us where you are on kind of interest rate positioning building in small rate hikes in the beginning of the year maybe cut later how do rate hikes from here kind of impact you and just a reminder of where you are on the swap book and how thats influencing nii today and how it rolls off would be helpful robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well sure let me ill try to cover some of that and then we can follow that up i mean definitely were positioned to benefit from the two rate hikes that we expect basis points each in february and march we do have a basis point cut in december but that wont play largely into the performance so were positioned well against that and well grow our nii were pointing to between and in terms of that range year overyear yeah i will say and we jumped into this right away forecasting for a full year in terms of guidance is always difficult this year in particular its more difficult than most youve heard that sentiment from some of our peers that have already reported really difficult because of all the uncertainties that we all know about so we put out what we think we can achieve bill and i talked a little bit about maybe some upside to that in terms of loan spreads but everything that we know now with all the uncertainties thats where were positioned no big change in terms of our rate management in terms of the swaps weve disclosed at around billion or so but of course thats all part of how we manage the balance between our fixed and variable william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the simplest way to think about that john is we through the course of the year the dv01 or the sensitivity we have for our long positions as if anything decreased so think about that in terms of both the securities book and the swap book so we remain largely assetsensitive happy with that position i mean that over time changes with the mix of swaps and securities the swaps themselves its kind of irrelevant to look at them separately but theyre very short and they roll off in big bulk couple of years robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc years william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks and rob maybe as a followup could you unpack a little bit of the outlook for the fee revenues that you gave for just some of the headwinds and tailwinds that are leading to that outcome on the noninterest income would be helpful robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah sure yeah sure john so just in terms of the categories where we expect to see growth capital markets we do expect midsingledigit growth which is good and consistent with our expectations our steady eddie card and cash management will probably be up highsingle digits and then those two will be offset by continuing headwinds in our asset management given the equity markets as well as lower mortgage production so you put all that together and thats how we get into our stable to up for the full year john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator our next question is from the line of gerald cassidy sic gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you hi rob hi bill robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey good morning gerard gerald also known as you know gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ive been called worse rob bill coming back to your thoughts on the spreads that you guys just referenced on the commercial loan book relative to the cecl outlook and im glad you framed it that way because i think many of us are in that camp that you just described but in terms of the spreads is there any capacity issues meaning theres too much lending capacity which has kept these spreads maybe lower than normal the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im not sure whats going on to be honest with you i mean theres on the smaller end in certain retail categories which really isnt our focus theres just irrational competition in certain asset categories in the larger corporate space where we have this opportunity to grow clients particularly in the new market than ultimately crosssell there just hasnt been any sort of gap the way youve seen in the public markets there hasnt been any real change spreads arent going down but there hasnt been any change at all with respect to kind of the outlook in this economy and until and if theres real defaults and chargeoffs there probably wont be so one of these things is going to give i just dont know which one it is gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good no i noticed in your table in the supplement the inflows of nonperformers had been pretty steady so theres real robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ph no excuse me real evidence yet thank you for that and then as a followup can you just remind us your outlook for returning capital to shareholders in the upcoming year with dividends and share repurchases robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah hey gerard and just to finish up on that on the credit spot to your point in the supplement ph the due nonperformers but also you take a look at our npas and our delinquencies which are down so the leading indicators are still very strong gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc agreed robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah on the share repurchases a couple of things one is we are going to continue our share repurchase program into secondly it will be at a reduced rate relative to what we did in and likely to be less than what we did in the fourth quarter of which was million couple things about that one is why lower one is given all the uncertainties that were seeing obviously we need to be smart and tactical in terms of our capital deployment as the year plays out but secondly and just logically the rate of repurchases slows when your capital ratios go from to so we still have a lot of capital flexibility the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 but by definition as we get closer to those operating guidelines we slow the pace of repurchases all that said theres flexibility as you know so with the stress capital buffer were allowed a lot of flexibility around it and we plan to use that flexibility as circumstances present themselves gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator our next question is from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob following up on your swaps commentary could you speak broadly to how youre thinking about downside protection in this environment any color you can give on where youd expect your nim to settle if the fed ultimately pushes the economy into say a mild recession cuts rates and fed funds normalizes say somewhere in the to level that would be great robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well i had to write all that down in terms of your assumptions there i would say in terms of nim obviously we get that question a lot its obviously an outcome so we dont guide to it we dont necessarily manage to it i think when you just take a step back you can see that we finished the quarter and finished the year at thats up from all of where we lived at so that basis point jump or so thats occurred we dont expect those kinds of swings going forward so going forward were now probably more like or basis point swings off of these levels and thats sort of the way that i think about it bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it separately theres been some concern that we could see the mix of time deposits and noninterestbearing deposits return not just to precovid levels but perhaps back to even pregfc levels in this environment can you speak to that risk both broadly at the industry level and more specifically as it relates to pnc william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean look were in a bit of an unknown environment we have the fed going through qt we have the fed absorbing deposits through their reverse repo facility we have at least in our case the ability to grow loans so you could see a scenario where deposits get scarce weve priced some of that thats in our forward guide in terms of our best look on that you can draw upside and downside to that kind of to robs point this coming year and the years after that are harder to forecast and model than some of the stability we had precovid so were doing our best and youve seen our best expectations robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 yeah i think thats right and in regard to the mix between noninterestbearing and interestbearing so far the shift that has occurred is perfectly consistent with what weve seen historically and consistent with our expectations bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah thats helpful bill and rob thank you if i may squeeze in one last one wanted to dig in a little bit into your expectation for a weaker economic outlook and mild recession and sort of square that with your reserve rate having been basically unchanged sequentially so it suggests that most of the reserve build was really growth driven maybe if the economic outlook does grow more challenging consistent with that mild recession scenario would it be reasonable to expect that your reserve rate could actually hold in your current levels or would it still likely drift a little bit higher from here any thoughts around that would help william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so a lot of moving pieces here but start with the basic notion that we are fully reserved for the book that we hold today against a forecast that we just we more heavily weighted the recessionary forecast than we had in the third quarter and then remember the chargeoffs that we took this quarter particularly the lumpier ones we mentioned one those were in a large way already reserved so our build right is actually more than you think the ratio ends up the same but we have kind of less we have lower nonperformers inside of that total book as a percentage maybe think of it that way robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc in terms of coming to that and then id also just remind you of our wherever we sit today at both first day cecl to now or what we have now relative to others against the composition of our loan book weve been at this in a fairly we think correctly but nonetheless conservative process robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc approach william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc approach using cecl bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc super helpful thank you for taking my questions robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes operator our next question is from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to talk a little bit about the expense side and i know you mentioned that there was a part of the expenses this quarter that was associated with revenue generating activities like capital markets and so that is a net positive to ppop so lets leave those expenses aside i wanted to dig in more to the expenses that did not come with commensurate revenues and understand what the drivers were behind those increasing and then talk a little bit about your outlook for off of what is now a higher base than what people had been expecting coming into today robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure i can start there so in regard to the fourth quarter expenses the biggest driver of the increase was personnel expense and to your point inside of that the variable comp associated with the higher business activity in addition to that we did have some medical expenses that we expect seasonally but they came in a little bit higher than what we would have expected outside of that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc explain why its seasonal robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc seasonal well sure well essentially william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its not a madeup thing you basically burn through your the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the deductibles william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the deductibles and then the company takes over after that so william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and that happens that happens seasonally this season it was a little bit higher than what we expected outside of that when you look at the marketing spend thats sort of timing in terms of how that falls in the year but the impairments that we took on various investments and assets which is part of your question there wasnt anything singular that would stand out it was a william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes there was we wrote off everything we had to do with crypto robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well that was part of it that was part of it so maybe bill wants to answer these questions but i would say there wasnt anything singular it was a handful of items that we took down in technology and that shows up in our equipment expense in occupancy there were some facilities that we rightsized for our space needs going forward that kind of thing so on the margin william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc why dont you go ahead and talk about ph the margin robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc okay yeah sure and then on the margin the im sorry just going into bills giving me another question but id say on the margin going into those impairments reduce some of our expense rates so that sort of helped so our guide is to in all of thats how that all stays connected the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy its kind of frustrating because none of the stuff in our expense line in the fourth quarter has anything to do with how we spend money i mean the comp with new business is great everything else was kind of we flushed a couple tech projects that didnt work out we rightsized occupancy marketing went up a little bit and then we get hit this quarter on chargeoffs which are im not going to call them artificially high they are what they are but theyre kind of lumpy as a function of something that weve been staring at for a while that finally hits the books robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc and were largely reserved to your point william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so as i think about the guide into next year for total expenses up to that is really related more towards your revenues of to and robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc this crypto thing whatever is a onetime one and done robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right yeah thats betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats gone thats right and thats why and i said in my opening comments we point to strong positive operating leverage in betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right and then separately i know we talked a little bit earlier about the capital and the fact that your cet1 has been migrating down as youve been doing some nice lending et cetera just wanted to understand the rwa density it looks like its gone up a bit and i just wanted to understand is that just loan growth or is there something else going on there is there some changes in how you think about rwa factors and then im just wondering like how what is the low on cet1 that youre willing to drive to as we think about demand for borrowing is still pretty robust robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure well so a couple of things on that i would say in terms of the rwa increase its entirely loan driven so weve had a lot of loan growth in a lot in the fourth quarter with that growth in average loans so thats the key driver of the rwa increase our cet cet1 ratio is at weve talked about an operating guideline of between and so were still above our operating guidelines and thats a good place to be betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so the low really thats how we should read it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 operator our next question is from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i was wondering if you guys could talk about the ph still potential for the tlac rules to come down to the category and how you would be thinking about either getting ahead of that or starting to issue or would you just have to wait for the final notice and then consider a phasein period william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean a lot of people talking about this not a lot happening around it were it to happen by the way we disagree with it but lets walk down the path and say somehow down the road people suggest that this should happen and thered be a phasein period practically as we look at the growth opportunity in our company new clients loan growth against what it is likely to be a constrained ability to grow total deposits right youre going to see our wholesale borrowings increase and in the course of our wholesale borrowings increase in the ordinary course of business were going to fulfill all our parts of that tlac requirement all of that is in the numbers were talking to you about itll take more than next year but in the way we think about indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc in terms of the normalized as we move towards more normalized mix william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so put in its simplest way to think about that maybe is our wholesale debt historically ran i dont know in the mid robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc ph to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah midteens i was going to say and were running so if we normalize thats with home loan in there robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc as we normalize our borrowings through time its likely were going to get and fulfill that requirement without purposely trying to do it just because thats the way we and other people will be funding institutions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah id just add to that thats all we see it on our path its not particularly problematic but theres a lot to be played out we still dont think its necessary and theres also a reasonable chance thered be some tailoring to it which would be reduced in our case ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes and as a followon to that to your point about wholesale borrowings funding loan growth incrementally can you just talk about how youre thinking about the securities portfolio you saw some growth this quarter i know youre getting good front book back book on it the percentage of earning assets is still around so how would you expect that to go visàvis the use of wholesale borrowings to continue to support that growth as well thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look you wouldnt purposely borrow wholesale and then invest in a security to hold in your securities book however inside of all the requirements that we manage ourselves to we also have liquidity requirements lcr and the need to hold highquality liquid assets so the securities book will likely fade in terms of total percentage over time simply because of loan growth that we see in some of the roll down that securities book is part of what we have in terms of cash and liquidity to satisfy lcr were not going to say hey lets borrow some money to buy more treasuries right that isnt going to happen but practically we use that book to hedge the value of our deposits well continue to do that and well continue to do that inside of the lens of lcr and other liquidity stresses that we run ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thank you both operator operator instructions our next question is from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey mike the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc well i guess in the category of no good deed goes unpunished i mean you did have positive operating leverage last year of basis points youre guiding for positive operating leverage this year between i guess and basis points your chargeoffs were below basis points every quarter youre buying back some shares yet your guidance from one month ago was off and your results fell below consensus now dont stop giving your guidance or anything like that and were all subject to the uncertainties out there but just a little bit more about whats changed in the past month so i guess unemployment you end rate assumption youre saying its over maybe where thats going to and i guess that drove some of the cecldriven reserve part of the reserves the nii and maybe your decision to lean into the securities purchases maybe because you think this is a relative top on yields thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so youre overcomplicating it one thing changed from a month ago and one thing only and that was basically the spread we thought wed earn on new business right we know mike that we can go out and grow loans our ability to gain clients crosssell those clients weve never been more bullish on that the process of doing that is not earning what we would otherwise expect in the moment because spreads have not widened and of course you take a full life of the loan reserve when you book that loan thats the only thing thats really changed the expenses this quarter are noise the guide for next year is tempered simply by that question of whether spreads are going to rise on loans maybe they will or our cecl analysis will be wrong we havent we never guide on what our provision is going to be we talk about chargeoffs and the chargeoff this quarter we felt was a bit anomalous so nothings really changed other than the sweat factor of hey can i actually earn what i thought i was going to earn on new loan production thats it mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so youre saying youre too conservative either on cecl reserves or your nii guide for the year and william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc well but i havent given you a number on my cecl reserves mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc right but we put in we worsened our economic forecast and the simple sound bite is either spreads are going to widen or our economic forecast is wrong i think thats a fair statement robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so theres an inconsistency there right mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you give a by the way if the ceo gig doesnt turn out maybe to become the economist because this is such a detailed outlook in your release about what you expect the economy and interest rates and everything else william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so you give a lot of detail indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah you asked a question on the securities book its just we basically stayed pretty much in the same position all year we get to reprice the book and you see the income coming out of the securities book growing nicely we havent invested into it its a tough market to invest into if you are in effect a depositfunded institution right if you want to go out and buy something today against your marginal cost of money youre basically carrying flat to negative today on the theory that the feds going to cut to what down the road and you got to believe that the feds going to go back into on fed funds which i just fundamentally dont believe so i think kind of the market is just uninvestable at the moment and i think thats going to be figured out through the course of the year and so theres upside my view on that plays out in the way wed run our securities book but at the moment theres no choosing to go long in this environment i think is a mistake mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc one more clarification william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you are reserved for your existing book of business assuming an unemployment rate of what level i know its above but could you be more robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc certainly operator our next question is from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess on the nii guide so i think weve spoken extensively about the spreads wanted to get how much of the inversion in the yield curve was a factor in impacting the nii outlook and tied to that like with the years at sub this morning like do you just not invest right now and wait for things to shake out or how do you think about balance sheet management in a world where maybe the year is headed to not next thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah so that impacts the nii guide a bit only in terms of what our reinvestment yield is and will be when we when the existing security book rolls down right so youve seen the book yield on that rise from wherever to what is it now something the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc oh yeah the total book yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah and that continues to increase as we as things roll off were reinvesting with high 5handles on securities look if the 10year goes to if you look at the five year and five years the implication of where longterm rates really have to head for that to be true i just dont buy i dont think were going to be an environment where the fed is bouncing shortterm funds around which i just dont think its going to happen i think were going to i think we will get inflation under control but i think its going to be a struggle to get it under long term and i think front rates will stay higher they might cut and likely will cut from some level but this assumption that theyre going to cut and therefore rates are going to go back to or i just think is absurd so therefore to me the back end of that curve is uninvestable youre right it could rally to there good for the people who own it as long as its not me ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah no thats fair and again im not saying it makes sense but its the world we live in and i guess tied to that im not sure if you gave explicit guidance in just terms of deposit growth outlook i mean still a lot of room when we look at the loantodeposit ratio just give us a thought around how youre thinking about letting additional sort of ratesensitive deposits run off having a smaller balance sheet creating more excess capital william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc look theres obviously we could in the near term increase earnings by being less competitive with deposits and let deposits run off we have the liquidity to do that we could increase our loantodeposit ratio the challenge with that is in the course of doing that youre damaging your longterm franchise so if youre losing deposits that are not core relationship deposits and maybe that makes sense but if youre losing customers in the process of that runoff thats a mistake and thats the logic we use in figuring out how we price deposits and how we grow or maintain deposits ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats fair and if i may one last question bill in terms of just the macro uncertainty how do you assess like the difference between credit normalization and whether or not we are getting into some version of a recession like can you conclusively think about that over the next few months or are we not going to know that until we are well into the depth of a downturn a few quarters from now william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc weve given you our best forecast the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah yeah yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean look theres a lot of unknowns here technically we could see ourselves heading into a full employment recession because youll have stale gdp for a couple of quarters but unemployment not ticking up to high levels and i dont even know how to think about that environment in terms of what chargeoffs might be robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i mean thats probably a really low chargeoff environment robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah well and just to your point in terms of what i said at the beginning its really difficult for the full year particularly this year weve put together what we think we can do william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats fair thanks for taking my questions operator operator instructions our next question is from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 i was wondering if we could just circle back on some of the lumpy costs i guess just in aggregate like how much were the impairment and then i think there was also you had called out some lumpiness from the long term in terms of ph planning which i think impacts both fees and comps if you could just kind of flesh out the aggregate lumpy costs that would be helpful thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah without we dont have specific numbers you can see them and you can see them as they break down in terms of our impairments within the occupancy line and the equipment line the long term was just the effect of a benefit in the third quarter and then it swung against us in the fourth quarter so not big numbers but just the delta between the two quarters drove the increase matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately i mean i heard you earlier kind of reiterate the to cet1 target over time and just any thoughts on the regional banks kind of just below your size it seems like theyre all kind of building capital close to and i dont know if its pressure behind the scenes from rating agencies or regulators or just conservatism for where we are in the cycle but any thoughts on the company your size being able to run when the ones obviously that the banks that are bigger are running higher but its just been interesting to note that the ones below you kind of billion in assets all seem to be building closer to robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc do you want to answer that william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i dont know indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well the only thing the only thoughts that i have just reacting is because the guidelines are typically drawn for all banks in terms of the stress capital buffers so how they stress you got to look at that and then its the relative capital level to the stress levels as opposed to the absolute levels but thats just my reaction matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay but i guess the point is like you feel comfortable with whatever kind of behindthescene stuff thats going on with the rating agencies regulators the and maybe drifting down a little bit over time but at you feel were comfortable with in the current environment william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yes yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question is from the line of vivek juneja with jpmorgan please go ahead vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi just a couple of quick ones any color on criticized assets how they did how those did in the quarter robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah relatively flat not a big change at all vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and bill just not to beat a dead horse to death but the whole sort of question on nii and swaps and protection given that you think of swaps and securities sort of as synonymously in terms of expressing your view on rates i would expect that youre going to hold off therefore even on the swap side in terms of adding protection yet until you see clearer signs of a lot more potential for rate cuts william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean its strange to me vivek youre a bit of a fixed income guy this notion of protection i mean what a lot of banks are doing is theyll put on forward starting swaps and theyll not have to eat negative carry in the course of doing that and theyll hope sometime by the time those come due that there is a negative carry because therell be a cut so you effectively i mean everything is priced at the forward curve when they do that trade it makes no sense to me its the same as choosing to invest at the moment and where the yield curve is thats my downside protection i can buy we can sell it we can use options and sell away upside and buy some downside protection as a practical matter were not widely out of bounds in terms of while were asset sensitive were not wildly asset sensitive and it just doesnt feel like the moment when youre supposed to be long particularly if you have a view that rates in the goforward decade are not going to look like rates during the to year vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 18jan2023 so thats where we sit vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay
