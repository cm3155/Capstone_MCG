ill turn the call over to mr young andrew andrew m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the second quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share preprovision earnings of billion were up compared to the first quarter and compared to the year ago quarter both periodend and average loans held for investment increased relative to the prior quarter driven by growth in our domestic card business periodend deposits declined in the quarter largely driven by tax related outflows our percentage of fdicinsured deposits grew to end the quarter at of total deposits we have provided additional details on deposit trends on slide in the appendix revenue in the linked quarter increased driven by noninterest income noninterest expense decreased in the quarter driven by declines in both operating and marketing expenses provision expense was billion with billion of net chargeoffs and an allowance build of million turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail the million increase in allowance brings our total company allowance balance up to billion as of june the total company coverage ratio is now up basis points from the prior quarter ill cover the drivers of the changes in allowance and coverage ratio by segment on slide in our domestic card business the allowance balance increased by million increasing our coverage ratio by basis points to three factors impacted the allowance in the quarter the predominant factor was growth as ending domestic card loans grew about billion in the quarter the second factor was the impact of removing the relatively lower loss content from the second quarter of and replacing it with higher forecasted loss content for the second quarter of as part of our 12month reasonable and supportable period these two factors were partially offset by an improvement in our economic outlook which still assumes worsening from todays level but less so than our outlook a quarter ago in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance declined by million mostly driven by the decline in loans the coverage ratio was essentially flat at and finally in our commercial banking business the allowance decreased by million in the quarter we moved approximately million of loans from our commercial office portfolio to held for sale as we pursue the potential sale of a portion of the portfolio to reduce future risk with that move we recognized chargeoffs that were already largely reflected in our allowance which was the primary factor driving this quarters decrease the decrease in allowance from moving these loans to hfs was partially offset by a build for our remaining commercial office portfolio capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 we have provided additional details on our commercial office portfolio in the appendix of tonights presentation the coverage ratio in the commercial business decreased by basis points and now stands at turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the second quarter was up from last quarter and a year ago total liquidity reserves in the quarter decreased by about billion to billion driven by modest declines in both cash and the investment portfolio our cash position ended the quarter at billion down about billion from the prior quarter we are also disclosing our net stable funding ratio for the first time this quarter the preliminary average quarterly nsfr for both the first and second quarters was well above the regulatory minimum turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our second quarter net interest margin was basis points lower than last quarter and basis points lower than a year ago quarter the quarteroverquarter decline in nim was driven by deposit and wholesale funding costs increasing more than asset yields that impact was partially offset by a continued mix shift towards card loans and one additional day in the quarter turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio ended the quarter at approximately basis points higher than the prior quarter net income in the quarter was partially offset by changes in riskweighted assets common and preferred dividends and the million of share repurchases we completed in the quarter at the end of the second quarter the unrealized losses in aoci from our afs investment portfolio were billion if we were to include the full impact of these unrealized losses in our regulatory capital our cet1 ratio would have ended the quarter at during the quarter the federal reserve released the results of their stress test our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement which will be effective on october of this year is resulting in a total fed capital requirement of we continue to estimate that our longerterm cet1 capital need is around with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you andrew and good evening everyone the domestic card business posted another quarter of strong yearoveryear top line growth purchase volume for the second quarter was up from the second quarter of last year ending loan balances increased billion or about yearoveryear and second quarter revenue was also up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans revenue margin declined basis points from the prioryear quarter and remained strong at the decline was driven by two factors first loans grew faster than purchase volume and net interchange revenue in the quarter this dynamic is a tailwind to revenue dollars but a headwind to revenue margin and second chargeoffs increased so we reversed more finance charge and fee revenue these factors were partially offset by an increase in the revolve rate the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear to the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end increased basis points from the prior year to and is now above its capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 june level the chargeoff rate hasnt quite caught up yet but based on what we see in our delinquencies we expect the monthly chargeoff rate will reach levels in the third quarter noninterest expense was up from the second quarter of driven by higher operating expense partially offset by a modest yearoveryear decline in marketing total company marketing expense was down about yearoveryear in the second quarter to million in most years marketing is lower in the first half of the year and higher in the second half in that pattern was less pronounced in our marketing is following a more typical historical pattern our choices in domestic card are the biggest driver of total company marketing and we continue to see attractive growth opportunities in our domestic card business our opportunities are enhanced by our technology transformation we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient growth and enhance our domestic card franchise and as always were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks were seeing the success of our marketing and strong growth in domestic card new accounts purchase volume and loans across our card business and strong momentum in our decadelong focus on building a franchise with heavy spenders at the top of the marketplace continues slide shows second quarter results for our consumer banking business in the second quarter auto originations declined yearoveryear driven by the decline in auto originations consumer banking ending loans decreased about billion or yearoveryear on a linkedquarter basis ending loans were down we posted another quarter of strong yearoveryear retail deposit growth second quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up about billion or yearoveryear compared to the sequential quarter ending deposits were down about largely as a result of typical seasonal tax outflows average deposits were up yearoveryear and up from the sequential quarter powered by our modern technology and leading digital capabilities our digitalfirst national direct banking strategy continues to deliver strong results consumer banking revenue was up yearoveryear driven by deposit growth noninterest expense was down about compared to the second quarter of driven by the timing of marketing to support our national digital bank the auto chargeoff rate for the quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear compared to the linked quarter the chargeoff rate was down basis points while the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points slide shows second quarter results for our commercial banking business compared to the linked quarter ending loan balances were down average loans were down the decline is largely the result of choices we made earlier in the year to tighten credit as well as the movement of loans to held for sale that andrew discussed ending deposits were down from the linked quarter average deposits declined we saw normal outflows throughout the second quarter as clients used their cash for payroll tax payments and other business as usual disbursements and consistent with the general trend weve seen for several quarters we also continued to manage down selective less attractive commercial deposit balances second quarter revenue was up from the linked quarter while noninterest expense was down about from the linked quarter second quarter commercial credit trends were largely driven by the commercial office portfolio inclusive of the movement of loans to held for sale the commercial banking annualized chargeoff rate capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 increased to in the second quarter the criticized performing loan rate was down basis points compared to the linked quarter and the criticized nonperforming loan rate increased basis points to in closing we continued to deliver top line growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loans in the second quarter we continue to lean into marketing to drive resilient domestic card growth that can deliver sustained revenue annuities and build our franchise and to drive growth in our national digital bank and we continue to expect that the full year annual operating efficiency ratio net of adjustments will be roughly flat to modestly down compared to pulling way up capital one is at the vanguard of a very small number of players who are investing to build and leverage a modern technology infrastructure from the bottom of the tech stack up to put themselves in an advantaged position to win as banking goes digital our modern technology capabilities are generating an expanding set of opportunities across our business we are driving improvements in underwriting modeling and marketing as we increasingly leverage machine learning at scale and our tech engine drives growth efficiency improvement and enduring value creation over the long term our investments to transform our technology and to drive resilient growth put us in a strong position to deliver compelling longterm shareholder value and thrive in a broad range of possible economic scenarios and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session and as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available after the call amy please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening rich good evening andrew maybe to start on the margin andrew where we saw some pressure can you maybe just talk about how to think about the margin from here you talked about card loans growing faster which is a tailwind but theres obviously rising deposit costs has been a headwind so when you put it all together what do you see the trajectory of the margin shaking out and embedded within that what are your most updated expectations for deposit betas at this point and i have a followup question andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure so why dont i start with the deposit beta piece ryan since that will feed into the nim as we talked about last quarter and you see playing out in the marketplace at this point theres just a number of factors that are impacting beta between product mix and the competitive dynamics on pricing just how quickly the fed has moved over the last five quarters all of this happening under the backdrop of ph qt and so we put that on top of our view for deposits all of the needs that we have our desire to grow customer relationships and the like and so those forces coupled with the fact that at this point in the cycle deposit pricing just tends to lag yields and so youve seen our betas continue to rise over the last few quarters i talked about the last cycle us being in the low and a quarter ago i said you should expect us to kind of move up from where we were we are now in the range i wouldnt be surprised if there continues to be upward pressure on beta from here given all of the factors that i just described so why dont i then start on your question about nim with headwinds that of course would be one the beta lag as well as what were seeing in the wholesale funding market spreads are a little bit wider so just overall funding costs i think would probably be a headwind and then were also seeing credit continue to normalize rich touched in his talking points around card margin so revenue suppression would be another headwind all else equal but we do see at least a few tailwinds one being the level of revolve rate in card in the second quarter it tends to be seasonally lower and just on a longerterm basis the current run rate has been lower over the last couple of years so both of those factors could be driving card margin up i also think that when you look at our cash position cash is likely to remain elevated relative to prepandemic levels this quarter we saw ending cash come down average cash was largely flat since we had built up cash over the course of the first quarter but i think you should expect that cash will remain elevated relative to pre pandemic but over time it probably will come down at least modestly from here and then the last thing is in the back half of the year well have an extra day in the quarter so as we move into q3 that will be a definitive tailwind so those are what i would enumerate as the primary forces at play and so one of the big ones thats going to drive the trajectory is really what ends up happening to beta capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then rich maybe as my followup maybe just an update on what youre seeing with the consumer when i look in the credit in the card book delinquencies the past four months have been rising lets call it basis points per year and given all the growth that has come on to the books the past months can you give us a sense for how to think about how far past level levels we could be going on losses and maybe andrew tie in what this all can mean for the allowance over time thanks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay thanks ryan so just to put some numbers behind your comments so the domestic card delinquencies in the second quarter were about higher than the same quarter of our chargeoffs are still a bit below their levels but based on what we see in our delinquencies we think theyll get back there in the next few months so when you interpret our credit metrics there are a couple of things to keep in mind there is one effect that is increasing our loss rate that is probably more pronounced for capital one at least for a time which is related to our recovery past chargeoffs are the raw material for future recoveries and we just lived through three years of very low chargeoffs so our recoveries will be unusually low in the short to medium term this is a larger headwind for us than for most others because we tend to have meaningfully higher recovery rates than the industry average and because we tend to work our own recoveries so they tend to come in over time not all at once which happens in a debt sale also we have to remember that the credit performance we saw over the past three years was unprecedented so we believe theres some catching up that happens on the other side of that especially for consumers who might otherwise have charged off over the past three years so we call this sort of the deferred chargeoff effect its something that really cant be measured we wont even be able to measure it in hindsight how big this effect is but its intuitively sort of the reverse of the effect we saw in the global financial crisis which in many ways just pulled forward chargeoffs for a lots of folks that were in a vulnerable position and then what we saw in the aftermath of that for those that and whether that we just saw strikingly low charge offs so i think really what kind of whats going on with this whole sort of normalization in the context of such extraordinarily low unemployment rates i think an important part here is sort of this deferred chargeoff effect and so thats the dynamic we see going on in our business we continue to feel very good about the credit performance were not giving guidance on predicting the level but we continue to lean into our growth opportunities because the metrics we see are very solid andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp and then with respect to the allowance ryan i know ive talked a lot about the mechanics in recent calls so ill spare all of you the tutorial but the first thing with respect to the allowance will obviously be allowing for future growth is an obvious contributor to where the allowance goes from here but then its really all about the outlook for losses and in particular what were projecting for loss rates a year out so rich just described a lot of the dynamics that are at play with our outlook for quarter losses so depending on how all those factors play out thats really going to have the biggest impact especially as you look out well into capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from richard shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah hey everybody thanks for taking my question hey rich i would describe that i think one of the hallmarks of capital one over the decades is almost a strategic optimism when you look at opportunities right now and where your peers are deploying capital where is your greatest strategic optimism richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp my greatest strategic optimism richard is in the card business weve first of all weve always been a big fan of the card business starting from the beginning of the company its not an accident that we chose the card business because we love the industry structure we love the opportunity to leverage the kind of strategies that we wanted to put in place the informationbased technologybased strategies and while that is something one can apply across all of financial services it certainly has tremendous leverage in a business like the card business so weve always loved the business as you know kind of youve followed us for a long time richard just because we love a business doesnt mean we constantly have our foot on the accelerator so we very much look at the industry structure and then look at the marketplace and make our choices often we end up zigging while others zag as you have seen in the past we feel very good about the opportunities in the card business for several reasons i think well first of all just the health of the consumer just consumer credit is in a very good place the consumer is in an exceptionally strong place and i think that gives a foundation of strength even in the context of an economy thats got some concerning aspects to it then we look at the competitive environment i think the competition is intense in card but it is rational we see people making credit choices and just when we look at the competition and this isnt always true in banking but i think we see a rational industry making rational choices and so i think the credit that is being delivered to the consumer is balancedto the appetite and so we feel good about the competitive environment we look at margins and where they are they are strong the credit environment as we talked about in my answer to ryan nash credit losses are increasing i think theres a catchup sort of delayed chargeoff effect but when we look at the metrics the metrics on recent originations the metrics on our back book with respect to performance of existing accounts credit line increases we just see strength across the board so we feel very good about that and we look at our marketing programs and they continue to generate a lot of new accounts and so pulling way up on that we like the metrics we like the results of our programs and we like the marketplace in credit and if i crosscalibrate to other parts of the marketplace the auto business even while weve been leaning into card we have been had more our foot on the brake over the last months in the auto business for a number of factors but probably the biggest one being what was happening on the pricing side and the difficulty in passing through increases in cost of funds that aspect has normalized mostly in the market the auto business has still capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 some unique aspects to it that we got to keep an eye on used car prices and theyve been elevated theyre likely to fall over time and so but all in all we see opportunity maybe expanding a little bit in the auto space but well have to keep an eye on that but in the very recent sort of months weve seen the opportunity to lean in a little bit more and then on the commercial side of the business obviously our biggest focus has been on the office portfolio and capital one again tends to take a different path than a lot of companies do but we i think for a lot of banks they tend to when they look at the credit environment when they see credit that is worsening in a particular sector they tend to pull back on originations which makes a lot of sense we often see one more notch on the continuum which is to look at the assets that we have and look from time to time at in fact selling those we have over the last few years we have actually unloaded something like this is well something like billion of loans thats not an official andrew is the one who gives the precise numbers what im saying is several billion dollars of sort of exiting that we have done now in this particular case we look at the market and see a lot of sustained stress in that market and feel that when we have an opportunity to relieve some of the higher stress aspects of that business we took that opportunity so pulling way up you see at capital one we for some of our business we have our foot on the brake and for other parts of the company our foot is on the gas but where i would leave you the net impression i would lead you it is really on the card side that were really leaning in the hardest richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc perfect thank you so much jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from mihir bhatia with bank of america your line is open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon and thank you for taking my questions i wanted to start maybe with expenses these come in a little bit better than i think what we were expecting they were down quarteroverquarter you mentioned you talked a little bit about returning to normal in your prepared remarks and i was just wondering if you could expand on that a little bit was there a decision like to slow down on growth investments pullback like i guess what changed just in terms of the expenses or the cadence of expenses through the year andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp typically mihir ill take that one if youre talking just q1 to q2 in the first quarter we typically have seasonal effects to compensation when bonuses are paid payroll tax issues you see that in the ph stb salary tax and benefit line there so thats really the largest single factor not necessarily a fundamental shift in any trajectory capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay and then maybe just going back to the nim conversation i mean i think you talked about some of the puts and takes in the near term but i was curious just about companywide nim or compared to historical right i mean it wasnt atypical for capital ones nim to be closer to high do you expect youll get back there or has something fundamentally changed in the business whether its the growth in the high balance transactors or something else where you wouldnt get back there andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well i dont think theres anything fundamentally different in the business mihir i think theres a lot of question around what happens to consumer behavior when we talked about revolve rate in card and other things and then also on the funding side partially dependent on what the fed ends up doing over an extended period of time where rates eventually settle out i mean i think those are all factors that could ultimately impact where the final resting place is for nim but theres nothing that is really fundamentally different across our book from where it was years ago jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good afternoon andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so i know rich you mentioned marketing following the typical seasonality this year and so expecting it to ramp up in the back half which makes a lot of sense and im just wondering when you think about where you want to spend those dollars is it more on new account acquisition spurring outstanding ph lawn utilization is travel a relatively easier one to pull at this stage and i guess what im just wondering is is there an opportunity to even get more return for your marketing dollars now versus maybe what youve had over the past couple of quarters given the need for people to borrow perhaps more than they had to a year ago so just those are some of the questions that i had thanks capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks betsy let me talk about the marketing yeah thanks for commenting about the seasonality i mean every year is different in terms of the quarterly patterns but we pointed out this year is seems like a more normal year with the back half with the more common back half higher back half than weve had in some of the anomalous times during the pandemic the marketing was flat compared in this quarter was flat compared to the prior quarter and down year overyear but i wouldnt draw really strong conclusions from that because as i already talked about were leaning into the marketing its just from a timing point of view some of our marketing it was just didnt happen to fall as much in this quarter and let me talk about the opportunities that we see and why were investing heavily in marketing really first of all we just see attractive growth opportunities across our business particularly in the card business weve continued to expand our products and our marketing channels were seeing very good traction these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation that enabled us to leverage more data access more channels leverage machine learning models and provide customized solutions that continues to just generate very good performance and were leaning in to capitalize on that so sort of category one is just the good opportunities that we see the second thing thats behind our marketing levels is something weve been talking about for a long time which is our ongoing focus on heavy spenders and it was really back in that we declared a strategic push for heavy spenders and we knew in looking at the business that thats not a thing that we can go lean in one year pull back another year this is a whole part of the marketplace which is about commitment its about building exceptional experiences great products and the brand so starting really with the venture launch way back in weve been leaning in hard there but of course it hasnt just been about flagship cards its been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and investing across really the digital experience the servicing experience the lifestyle and product experiences as well and whats been nice about this is that weve and youve seen in our purchase volume growth a lot of growth of purchase volume but another strong manifestation of this is the rate of growth year after year has been higher at the higher end than the average so we continue to get increased traction going up and up in the pursuit of heavy spenders now of course heavy spenders have much higher upfront cost of marketing promotions brand building and hence its a big factor in why the marketing levels at capital one if you compare back to many years ago theyre sort of structurally higher but thats in pursuit of this really i think company transforming benefits that were getting there a third factor driving our marketing levels betsy is our continuing investment in building our national retail bank as you know we have only a modest presence in terms of physical distribution and so to get there we lean heavily on our modern technology and a compelling digital experience and along with that a sustained investment in marketing so thats a bit about whats behind our marketing levels that youre seeing and the opportunities we see and if we really look across those three sort of buckets just the growth opportunities we see the opportunities in building the heavy spender franchise and then the building of the national bank being sort of the one bank thats building a capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 fullservice bank without trying to do it via a branch on every corner all of this marketing is the engine behind this and we continue to lean into it and be very pleased with the performance betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and its growth rate expectations should be following similar patterns to the precovid environment richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp were not betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc if were not impacted richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp well let me comment for a second well let me first say were not really giving growth outlook the thing i really want to say about marketing is marketing drives the origination of accounts the real growth of our card business comes really from balanced growth and also from purchase volume growth of course but the those are not oneforone things but what we have been focused on since the founding of the company is building a company that has an organic growth engine focused on originations and leveraging the technology and analytical capabilities that we built and so our when you see our leaning in hard to marketing think about that is the engine thats driving new accounts and over time those accounts really are to your point even though the timing is not oneforone those accounts are really the foundation for the continued outstandings and revenue growth of the company jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you andrew i hate to do this but i want to go back to the allowance coverage trends going forward if we zoom into that complex calculation of removing previous and adding future quarters of net chargeoffs in your current forecast do you have losses sort of rising through the end of next year and maybe you could just touch on the new macro baseline and what the unemployment rate assumption is andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah so the baseline assumption and our outlook focusing i imagine youre looking mostly for unemployment rate so we have it increasing from the ph it is today to at the end of this year and then moving higher in the but staying in the through that compares to our assumption last quarter of i capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 believe it was ph but remember that our models tend to use the change in unemployment rates or the rate of job creation which were forecasting to come down to nearly zero rather than the level of unemployment and so its not just about those factors too in our allowance were also considering downside scenarios that are much more severe than that baseline so when you take that into account to your first question around what are we assuming im not going to give specific forecast rich listed out kind of the factors that we believe will create upward pressure on our loss rates in the near term at least and so we did assume that theres higher losses in the second quarter of next year than the quarter that we just left sort of mechanically as i described this quarters allowance but where that goes from here is just so heavily assumptionladen focused on the back half of the year id really focus your attention much more to delinquencies as the leading indicator to chargeoff especially in the near term because thats where the economics ultimately are felt as opposed to the allowance that is going to move quartertoquarter based on assumptions looking many quarters into the future sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay rich i asked this question to one of your competitors earlier but can you just pinpoint whats exactly attractive about the growth youre seeing in card today versus in the past they are also growing at a pretty rapid rate and obviously you guys have been very successful at growing this business over time but the market remains competitive you talked about the credit normalization theres obviously a potential for economic challenges im just trying to think through the risks richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so sanjay there certainly are things to be worried about the economy is unusual and has aspects of a lot of strength and a lot of concern the credit normalization we all see it and so im going to make the worry case just slightly here for a second the credit normalization has we credit is still at very attractive levels but it still has an upward slope to it and nobody well we certainly dont feel in a position to predict exactly where that settles out and so well have to keep that very much front and center and the market is very competitive absolutely so at a time like this we so well on the strong side i start with the health of the consumer so lets just think about this because the us consumer is a real source of relative strength in this uncertain economy the labor market has proven strikingly resilient over the past year and there are signs of cooling but so far theyre playing out gradually without abrupt or severe job losses that we see in severe downturns another striking thing the debt servicing burdens remain low by historical standards despite rising interest rates home prices have started to tick back up after falling for a while and weve talked a lot about consumers and their excess savings that they built up through the pandemic and they still have some excess savings although that buffer is shrinking and for many consumers i think its been fully consumed by higher prices the big negative back to negatives the big negative out there has been inflation and real wages have been pushed down since really over the last couple of years and consumer confidence thats been pretty shaky but on the whole id say consumers are in reasonably good shape so then we also believe when the we have believed for quite a while you remember in our conversations even as the losses are rising these days because we do believe that the deferred chargeoff phenomenon is something that is very natural to occur were not alarmed to buy where losses are going then we look at our own capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 metrics and if we well obviously weve talked about delinquencies weve talked about chargeoffs we also look at payment rates and revolve rates and i just want to make a comment about payment rates im struck by the strength in payment rates throughout the course of the pandemic payment rates increased not only for us but across the industry and more recently very naturally payment rates have drifted down from pandemic highs and you can see in our trust metrics the pretty whopping payment rates thats still there i guess what im struck by is that payment rates not only overall for capital one which could definitely has a mix shift toward heavy spenders as potentially driving that but even when we look by segment were struck by the continuing relative strength in payment rates so thats a good guy and probably the biggest factor that we look at is the recent originations the vintage curve performance and the overall level of risk that were seeing so far in our new originations is consistent with certainly consistent with our expectations but also on a comparative basis when we look at the earliest delinquencies on our newest monthly vintages of originations we see performance that is consistent with prepandemic risk levels in each of our major segments and vintage over vintage were also seeing relatively stable risk levels over time now one thing i want to say and sanjay you remember weve talked about this theres two ways you can this can happen one is the sort of unmanaged and the other is the managed way my favorite way is when vintage performance with the same credit policies as several years ago when that is on top of the old things the old originations from years ago thats actually not the case on what we call a likeforlike basis the recent originations have worse credit than they had years ago again not surprising at all to us we all along the way have been managing reactively and proactively around the edges where we either see or would expect maybe performance to be not as good and so we have trimmed around the edges in our originations and so on a net basis it is sort of just happens to be that originations these days are on top of where they were several years ago so pulling way up and based on for me more than three decades of experience of doing this in the card business the opportunities that we see and enhanced by a lot of technology innovations and things like that we see it as a good time to keep leaning in we have a very watchful eye on all those negatives that you and i talked about but on a calibration basis i would i like the opportunity i just want to say one more thing which you are right a lot of times we have leaned in when others are pulling back as a general observation most of the industry is leaning in that gets our attention its not as sustainable often when thats the case so were going to watch it carefully but that gave you a little window into how were looking at this and the optimism that we feel at this moment jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from don fandetti with wells fargo your line is open donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 yes rich can you talk about what youre seeing on credit card spend growth rates recently in terms of the like forlike account basis i know it was sort of flat to down last quarter and do you think that well continue to see moderation richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so lets pull up first of all our domestic card purchase volume was up yearoveryear but thats to your question don thats really powered by the growth in our customer base when you look at spend per customer this has moderated and is now generally flat from a year ago and the moderation in spending appears to be broadbased weve observed it across income bands and card segments weve also seen it across both discretionary and nondiscretionary categories by the way its not surprising at all that this would sort of level out the consumer pulled way back in the pandemic just an unprecedented amount of pullback and now and sort of has come roaring back on the other side but i think for the individual customer things are sort of settling out and so i think when we ask what would we wish for i think this is a sensible like so often i always say thats the most sensible constituency in all of the marketplace tends to yet again be the consumer but overall we think that spend moderation is the sign of a rational and healthy behavior on the part of the consumer and then we match it with the payment rates and those are look those are normalizing somewhat the revolve rates are normalizing somewhat but both the payment rate and the revolve rates on a segmentby segment basis are still not ph there theyre at theyre not at the prepandemic levels yet which indicates an underlying strength at least on average even when maybe at the margin youre seeing some of these deferred chargeoffs that are driving up credit losses donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question comes from arren cyganovich with citi your line is open jeff norris a senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp arren are you there operator our last question comes from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer your line is open dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thanks so much for taking my questions rich i was just thinking about turns in the credit cycle what are some of the mistakes that you think card issuers make and even lenders in general and where do you look for the weakness in the overall space of lending to give you caution when you start to see that turns in the credit cycle and i also have a followup thank you capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 richard d fairbank a chairman chief executive officer capital one financial corp so yeah its i really appreciate the question dominick because ive often said were not in a position i wouldnt have any of you put any more stock or stake i guess you investors put stock in but i wouldnt put any particular stake in our ability to predict the economy but the credit cycle and the economy are not the same thing theyre correlated but i think that the credit cycle is the thing that we really focus a lot on because i think a lot of elements of it are pretty predictable obviously it is influenced by and influences the economy so the so lets sort of pull way up we were in this extraordinary period no one has ever seen before in terms of the credit quality during the pandemic and we enjoyed and our investors enjoyed the high returns that we made in that time but some of you may remember my saying be careful what you wish for because with every passing month that this cycle is abnormally good we will pay the price later on the other side of that causally because what and so if you get into the behavior and it really links not so much at all to the behavior of consumers its really about kind of to your question what happens to lenders providers of credit in at this part of the cycle especially in an extreme thing and we saw alarming things happening during the most extremely extreme periods during the pandemic the most striking one to me was the absolute surge in fintech lending how much of it there was who knows because most of them arent reporting to the credit bureaus so its just a matter of trying to infer whats going on but so there was a big surge in supply particularly to subprime which is where almost all fintechs go after and that was alarming to us and we felt with every month that that supply keeps coming there as i said earlier theres a price to be paid then you look then we look at the context of overlay on top of that the to your question about the common mistakes what the fintechs almost by definition were doing because im not sure what else they would do is they were leveraging technology building models in a lot of cases but the rearview mirror that they were looking into the data set their models had were the greatest credit economy in the history of lending so thats a dangerous kind of data set for the models it was exacerbated by credit scores that had drifted dramatically more a lot of subprime customers moving into prime just by sort of the way scoring works and what was happening as a result of the savings rates going up for consumers so the so with fintechs particularly but for all the players in the business the danger of the rearview mirror the danger of the misreading the credit risk of customers because they were artificially their scores would be artificially good by the way in our case we pretty much just intervened in our own modeling and created a way to assume worse than the data says we also in our case put heavy reliance on data and modeling from way back in the last few decades that allows us to sort of get past that so that its primarily the overexuberance of lenders in the environment of a combination of a great rearview mirror and frankly a lot of extra earnings and feeling the ability to deploy a bunch of that into marketing now whats happened since then i think this sort of great normalization has been a very healthy thing it would be shocking if it didnt happen but from a health of the industry point of view i think its a very good thing obviously the fintechs fintech lending has gone way most of it is retreated significantly i am struck my earlier comment as we watch very carefully the credit card industry i think the major players seem to be pretty rational about the credit choices they make and now for everybody with chargeoffs rising and without leveling necessarily manifesting itself i think its bringing back the appropriate cautions in time for a softer landing here than might otherwise have been there so those are some of the thoughts that we have and those are things to keep an eye on capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 one other thing that i just sort of ph see the moment here on things that are on our mind because i always try to my goal here is to always give you a window into how were thinking and what net impression do i want folks to come away with as we look at opportunities and a thing thats very much on our mind is the cfpb efforts on late fees and i just want to just comment on that because that its a very important thing thats going on the cfpb late fee proposal effectively reduces late fees by approximately and the cfpb is going after the fee that we believe is the most important fee in consumer credit business late fees provide a direct and clear incentive for customers to pay on time and avoid becoming delinquent and damaging their credit records and a small late fee may not have that deterrent effect late fees are also a way that issuers can partially price for risk and this enables greater access for consumers greater access to credit and a lower cost of credit on average a reduction in late fees is almost certain to reduce credit access to certain parts of the population and the cfpb proposal is of course not yet finalized and it could be subject to delays or changes due to litigation but we have to plan for the potential of this becoming law early next year and capital one has pursued a strategy of offering very simple credit card products with limited fees and complexity and ironically the late fee has been an important part of our product structure because of the reasons that i cited earlier if the proposed rule is implemented there will be a significant impact to our revenue gradually resolving over time and there are ways to mitigate the impact but as a practical matter those solutions will take several years to work their way through the portfolio so as we pull up and i share with you how were thinking of the business we really like the opportunities in the card marketplace for all the reasons that ive talked about but we also need to really stare at this proposal that may become the rule of the land and i just wanted to share with you how were thinking about that and thats an important focus of capital one and our solutions to that will be very focused on finding solutions that are consistent with maintaining a winning customer franchise and thats a thing that takes time to work its way in do you have another question dominick you wanted to ask dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc yeah thanks so much rich i cant agree with you more on the late fee comments as well especially access to credit makes perfect sense this one is not as interesting i guess i was just looking for some help on the model when you look at professional fees or professional service expense it was down pretty big yearoveryear while the salaries were maybe a little elevated versus seasonality i was wondering if you brought some of those folks inhouse or how to think about the professional services given that is some of the debt collection piece i believe and then was there a gain in the other noninterest income from the sold portfolio any help there would be great and thanks for everything and the comments andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure so i think youve got it right in terms of looking at salaries and benefits in professional services in conjunction with one another as we were making substantial investments in technology we were supplementing that with some thirdparty resources we brought that down as weve been able to use our brand our recruiting brand to bring incredible talent into the organization and so its really looking in some ways at those two lines in conjunction with one another to get a sense for the kind of underlying overall labor trend capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q2 earnings call 20jul2023 and then in other noninterest income no its well not specifically a sale one of the biggest things in that creates some quartertoquarter fluctuation is agency income in our commercial business so its a little bit lumpy but we saw some real strength in the quarter and so thats what drove the quarteroverquarter increase there jeff norris senior vice presidentfinance capital one financial corp well that
