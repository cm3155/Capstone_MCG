want to leave you with today first we are executing our organic growth strategies and leveraging our position of strength as planned and managed over the years our liquidity and capital metrics are top tier second we delivered loan growth in the quarter and expect the pace to accelerate over the remainder of the year our teams are acquiring new customers and relationships in both commercial and consumer categories we are maintaining our momentum in deposit gathering with a wellmanaged beta third we expect to drive sequential increases in net interest income and fee revenues from the level reported in the first quarter supported by accelerating loan growth coupled with effective balance sheet management fourth we continued to rigorously manage credit consistent with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite finally we are positioned to power earnings expansion over the course of the year and into our investments are delivering results and the underlying core is performing well huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 i will move us on to slide to recap our performance we delivered loan growth with balances growing by billion from a year ago and have grown by a cagr over the past two years this pace reflects our intentional optimization efforts last year and we believe we are positioned to accelerate growth over the course of and carrying into deposit balances also increased growing billion or over the past year capital remained strong with reported common equity tier of and adjusted common equity tier of inclusive of aoci liquidity remains top tier with coverage of uninsured deposits of a peerleading level credit quality was stable as net chargeoffs improved by basis point from the fourth quarter to basis points we are sustaining momentum in growth of our primary bank relationships with consumer and business increasing by and respectively yearoveryear we continue to seize opportunities to add talented bankers over the past two quarters weve added teams in the carolinas and texas weve also launched new commercial specialty verticals including fund finance healthcare abl and native american financial services the momentum we have across our markets coupled with our strong culture continues to attract great banking talent to huntington we expect to add additional colleagues and capabilities as we move through the year we have clear objectives for focused on executing our organic growth strategies this should result in accelerated loan growth sustained deposit growth and expanded fee revenue streams coupled with our expense outlook we expect to see ppnr expanding over the course of the year and into the macro environment is conducive to growth with customer demand holding up well in a resilient and stable economy the addition of new markets and bankers is supporting expanding loan pipelines with latestage commercial pipelines ending the quarter at the highest level in over a year zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our fourth quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of and adjusted eps of the quarter included million of notable items primarily related to the updated fdic deposit insurance fund special assessment of million which was driven by higher losses from last years bank failures additionally we incurred million of costs related to incremental business process offshoring efficiency plans that were finalized during the quarter these items collectively impacted eps by per common share return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter adjusted for notable items rotce was average deposits continued to grow during the quarter increasing by billion or cumulative deposit beta totaled through quarterend average loan balances increased by million or for the quarter credit quality remained strong with net chargeoffs of basis points allowance for credit losses was stable and ended the quarter at turning to slide as i noted average loan balances increased quarteroverquarter and were higher by yearoveryear for the quarter loans increased at a annualized pace we expect the pace of future loan growth to accelerate over the course of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 loan growth was commercialled for the quarter with total commercial loans increasing by million commercial balance growth included distribution finance which increased by million benefiting from normal seasonality auto floorplan increased by million cre balances declined by million all other commercial portfolios were relatively unchanged on a net basis within other commercial we saw notable strength in regional and business banking balances as a result of sustained production levels and the continued retention of all sba loan production on balance sheet in total consumer loans average balances were flat overall for the quarter within consumer residential mortgage increased by million benefiting from production as well as slower prepay speeds average auto balances declined by million however increased by million on an endofperiod basis rvmarine average balances declined by million and home equity was lower by million turning to slide as noted we drove another quarter of solid deposit growth average deposits increased by billion in the first quarter on a yearoveryear basis deposits have increased by billion or total cumulative deposit beta continued to decelerate quarteroverquarter and ended at consistent with our expectations for this point in the rate cycle our current outlook for deposit beta remains unchanged trending a few percentage points higher so long as there is a pause from the fed and then beginning to revert and fall when we see rate cuts market expectations for rate cuts have clearly been pushed out compared to our january earnings call we continue to believe that there will be rate cuts over time and the impact of beta will be a function of the duration in this pause from the fed turning to slide noninterestbearing mix shift is tracking closely to our forecast average noninterestbearing balances decreased by billion or from the prior quarter we continue to expect this mix shift to moderate and stabilize during on to slide for the quarter net interest income decreased by million or to million net interest margin declined sequentially to cumulatively over the cycle we have benefited from our asset sensitivity and earning asset growth with net interest revenues growing at a cagr over the past two years reconciling the change in nim from q4 we saw a decrease of basis points this was primarily due to lower spread net of free funds which accounted for basis points along with a basis point benefit from lower average fed cash and basis points positive impact from other items including lower hedge drag impact we continue to benefit from fixed rate loan repricing we have seen notable increases in fixed asset portfolio yields thus far in the rate cycle and many of our fixed rate loan portfolios retain substantial upside repricing opportunity through and into as a reminder we continue to analyze and develop action plans for a wide range of potential economic and interest rate scenarios for both shortterm rates as well as the slope and level of the curve the basis of our planning and guidance continues to be a central set of those scenarios that are bounded on the low end by a scenario that includes three fed fund cuts in which tracks closely to the current fed dot plot this scenario is also aligned to the forward curve from the end of march for longerdurated time points its important to note that the level of the curve in the two to fiveyear term points is an important driver of our asset repricing and spreads the higher scenario assume rates stay higher for longer with no fed fund rate reductions this year this scenario also assumes the longerdurated time points remain at or above the levels at huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 quarterend in both of these scenarios as we project further out into we continue to believe it is most likely that there will eventually be rate cuts at some point as we get into next year comparing our latest outlook for those scenarios to the range of outlook we shared in our january guidance there have certainly been changes given the volatility of rates over the past quarter both scenarios now expect fed funds to stay elevated for longer which will drive some incremental deposit beta while the belly of the curve has improved which will also support asset yields and repricing benefit its difficult to predict exactly how the rate environment will play out over the course of the year as we look at the impact of this rate outlook on our business the fundamental elements of our prior guidance remain unchanged theres much of the year left to play out and as a result were maintaining our range for full year spread revenue growth at the margin were seeing somewhat higher funding costs as the expected timing of rate cuts has been pushed out if this plays out for the full year our view is that the overall nim outcome could be a few basis points lower than our previous guidance in both scenarios importantly were also seeing strong continued deposit growth that is more likely to be at the top end of our deposit growth guidance range which provides good core funding for accelerating loan growth we continue to see q1 as the trough for net interest income on a dollar basis we expect sequential growth in spread revenues from this level during the remaining quarters of the year we also continue to project that a higher rate scenario will produce a higher overall nim in this scenario we would see a more extended trend of higher deposit beta and hence overall funding costs would be higher we would also see an incrementally higher fixed asset repricing benefit importantly our core focus is on driving revenue growth and as i noted we continue to forecast that the combination of this margin outlook coupled with accelerating loan growth will drive solid revenue expansion from here this will support accelerating earnings growth rates as we move throughout this year and continue on into turning to slide our level of cash and securities increased as we benefited from higher funding balances from sustained deposit growth as well as our senior note offering and abs transactions in the first quarter we expect cash and securities as a percentage of total average assets to remain at approximately to as the balance sheet grows over time we are reinvesting securities cash flows in shortduration hqla consistent with our approach to continue to manage the unhedged duration of the portfolio lower over time we have reduced the overall hedged duration of the portfolio from years to years over the past quarters turning to slide you can see an updated outlook for aoci based on the rate environment at quarter end aoci moved incrementally higher aoci at quarterend was lower than the levels we saw in the third quarter our outlook continues to forecast a substantial portion of aoci recapture over the next couple of years turning to slide we have updated the presentation of our balance sheet hedging program in order to more directly illustrate the intent of the hedging program this view shows the effective swap profile in the future including the effect of forward starting swaps so you can see more directly the hedging exposures as they will play out over the next two years slide in the appendix provides the total notional swap exposure similar to our prior reporting as of march we have billion of effective received fixed swaps and billion of effective payfixed swaps our hedging program is designed with two primary objectives to protect margin and revenue and down huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 rate environment and to protect capital in potential uprate scenarios the payfixed swaps which have been effective in protecting capital during this rate cycle have a weighted average life of just over three years and will begin to mature beginning in the second quarter of as these instruments mature our asset sensitivity will reduce over time we intend to gradually add to our down rate protection program at a measured pace as the rate outlook moved over the course of the first quarter and the yield curve became less negatively inverted we incrementally added to our down rate protection hedges we added billion of notional forward starting received fixed swaps in the first quarter additionally through the first two weeks of april we added another billion of forward starting received fixed swaps the forward starting structure minimizes nearterm negative carry while protecting moderate term net interest margin in and these instruments will also reduce the overall asset sensitivity of the business we will remain dynamic to manage the hedging and interest rate positioning of the balance sheet and we may make further changes over time our current approach is designed to gradually reduce asset sensitivity throughout the next year and a half while allowing us to maximize the benefit from the current rate environment moving on to slide our fee revenue growth is driven by three substantive areas capital markets payments and wealth management in capital markets total revenues declined from the prior quarter driven by lower advisory revenues commercial bankingrelated capital markets revenues increased sequentially since troughing in the third quarter as commercial loan production continues to accelerate this will support growth in areas such as interest rate derivatives fx and syndications debt capital markets is also expected to notably benefit over the course of the year within advisory pipelines and backlog continued to remain robust and we expect advisory to contribute to growth in capital markets revenues over the remainder of the year payments cash management revenue was seasonally lower in the first quarter and increased yearover year debit card revenue continues to outperform industry benchmarks treasury management fees have increased yearoveryear as we have deepened customer penetration we have substantive opportunities across the board in payments to grow revenues over the coming years our wealth asset management strategy is delivering results with revenues up from the prior year we are seeing great execution and the benefits of our investments in this area advisory relationships have increased yearoveryear and assets under management have increased yearoveryear turning to slide on an overall level gaap noninterest income increased by million to million for the first quarter excluding the impacts of the marktomarket on the payfixed swaptions in the prior quarter and the crt fees declined seasonally by million quarteroverquarter our first quarter fee revenue is generally the low point for the year and we expect noninterest income to grow sequentially from this quarters level moving on to slide on expenses gaap noninterest expense decreased by million and underlying core expenses decreased by million during the quarter we incurred million of incremental expense related to the fdic deposit insurance fund special assessment as well as million related to our ongoing business process offshoring program to drive efficiencies excluding these items core expenses were marginally lower in the first quarter than we expected largely due to timing of certain spend on tech and data initiatives as well as lower incentive compensation we continue to forecast core expense growth for the full year from a timing standpoint we expect core expenses to be higher in the second quarter at approximately million this level should be relatively stable huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 for the third and fourth quarter there may be some variability given revenuedriven compensation as well as the pace of expected new hiring activities this level of expense supports our investments into organic growth strategies as well as data and technology initiatives slide recaps our capital position common equity tier ended the quarter at our adjusted cet1 ratio inclusive of aoci was and has grown basis points from a year ago our capital management strategy remains focused on driving capital ratios higher while maintaining our top priority to fund highreturn loan growth we intend to drive adjusted cet1 inclusive of aoci into our operating range of to on slide credit quality is coming in as we expected and continues to perform very well net chargeoffs were basis points in q1 basis point lower than the prior quarter they remain in the lower half of our throughthe cycle range of to basis points allowance for credit losses was stable at nonperforming assets increased approximately from the previous quarter to basis points while remaining below the prior level the criticized asset ratio also increased approximately quarteroverquarter with sequential increases slowing quarteroverquarter the overall health of the portfolio is strong and tracking to our expectations lets turn to our outlook for overall our guidance ranges are unchanged on loans we expect to drive accelerated growth from the first quarter totaling between and on a fullyear basis this will be driven by solid performance in our core as well as meaningful contribution from the new teams and market expansions on deposits were keeping the overall range the same up between and we do see it more likely to end up at the higher portion of that range based on our momentum and the traction were seeing with deposit gathering net interest income is expected to be within a range of down and up on a fullyear basis as i noted we see nim likely a few basis points lower than our earlier guidance we project spread revenue to expand on a dollar basis from the q1 level into the second quarter and throughout fee growth strategies remain on track and we continue to see core noninterest income growth of to for the full year expense outlook is unchanged expecting core expense growth for the full year credit quality as i mentioned is tracking closely to our expectations and we continue to expect fullyear net chargeoffs between and basis points with that well conclude our prepared remarks and move to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you well now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions as a reminder please limit yourselves to one question and one followup our first question is coming from manan gosalia from morgan stanley your line is now live manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning manan welcome manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey so your comments on the nii guide were very thorough so really appreciate that i think so the lower end of your guide is now for three cuts and i think your guide is a little bit more conservative on deposit betas than some of the other comments weve heard so i was wondering if you can expand on that a little bit is that based on conversations youre having with customers or whats driving that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc sure manan thanks for the question this is zach ill take that broadly speaking were seeing the nim outcome very similar to the view we had before just as i mentioned its sort of moderate tuning lower and clearly the biggest change in the environment over the last three months since we gave guidance in january was the expectation for a much longer pause in the spread posture before any rate reduction and so at the margin really were seeing slightly higher deposit funding costs and overall interestbearing liability costs the other thing thats important which ive noted in the prepared remarks as well is the deposit volumes are coming in very strong and slightly at the higher end of our prior expectation as well and so thats contributing somewhat although really good core funding clearly for really accelerating loan growth over time so thats really the driver as we entered the quarter ill just provide one last piece of color on that as we entered the quarter the market forward was for the first rate reduction to be in march right we always knew that that was we took the view that that was likely not to be the case but clearly that was the forecast of the market broadly and were beginning to execute the early stages of the down beta actions weve discussed shortening cd term duration changing other elements of our pricing indiscernible throughout the quarter clearly that reset and so weve had to continue to be dynamic as we would always be in managing deposit pricing and likely now those more substantive downgrade actions would push further out so thats really the biggest driver of sort of the timing of when well begin to see more significant downgrade actions over time we would expect it to be just as effective going forward as weve been in the past on that it is really just when will that occur and add a few bps of additional funding costs here in huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc so is any of that because youre also planning ahead of this accelerating loan growth that youre expecting zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc that was a good question manan look the posture indiscernible here clearly of when will rate cuts reduce and also not only when will the first one happen but what will be the expected trajectory by the market and by customers clearly thereafter for us were very dynamic and granular on how we manage this to really optimize the next step unit of funding here so continually thinking about when is that rate cut going to happen and obviously attempting to play in front of it with that being said were talking about marginal tuning here and that we wouldnt over plan it stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah if i could add this is steve our commercial pipeline is very robust and each month of the quarter has improved so we go into the second quarter with a very good healthy outlook and as we think about guidance for the year we think on the loan side were going to be closer to the top end which is in part of the consideration for adding the deposits at the rate that were doing here at this earlier stage of the year manan thanks for the question operator thank you our next question is coming from john pancari from evercore isi your line is now live zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi so thanks for the color on the nii guide just to confirm again so it does you did indicate that you are factoring in a higherforlonger environment when all is said and done in your outlook but again you maintain the nii guide of down to up is the primary reason for the maintaining that versus any upside bias would be is it mainly the deposit costs that you just discussed coming in higher or is there any other factor zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 that is the primary driver so yes is the answer to that seeing a little lower a few basis points lower nim but incrementally somewhat stronger loan growth those things are largely offsetting indiscernible the ultimate results in that guidance range and importantly the key thing for us is that trajectory growing net interest income on a dollar basis out of the first quarter and into the second quarter and continuing on into the third and fourth quarter so the outcome of that is going to be solidly expanding revenue growth and solidly expanding profit growth as well so yes to the fundamentals of your question and overall generally unchanged john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks for that zach and then separately back to the loan growth topic steve you just discussed that youve got confidence in the outlook particularly given your pipelines maybe can you talk about where demand stands now where utilization is now and what type of inflection do you see here because it seems like youve got confidence in the back half strengthening and i mean what anecdotal data do you have that kind of support that acceleration thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc thanks john we see the commercial pipeline for the second quarter particularly the high probability to close level to be very very very strong relative to the last five quarters so as ive said each month has improved in the first quarter second quarter strength is obvious now at this stage were also seeing good business banking loan growth and we have the benefit of these new initiatives none of which have books that theyre carrying so the three new initiatives specialty banking last year and then carolinas off to a really good start texas i was there a couple of weeks ago weve got a great team there as well all of those investments will bolster our activities throughout the year and then as you know weve got one of the largest indiscernible finance companies in the country that tends to be somewhat seasonal fourth quarter so those would be the combination of factors that give us a lot of confidence that well be at or near that upper end of our guidance for the full year operator thank you our next question today is coming from scott siefers from piper sandler your line is now live r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking the question i kind of wanted i wanted to revisit the margin as well so on the deposit pricing is it possible to make sort of a broad comment about is this sort of something that youre seeing and reflecting on kind of market pricing pressures or would you say youre more on sort of the leading because it sounds like were trying to support the loan growth which is obviously a very positive differentiating factor but are you all kind of leading with pricing on the deposit side to fund that growth or what does the competitive dynamic look like as well zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah great question scott this is zach ill take it i would characterize the competitive intensity of the market as generally consistent today with how it was at this time last quarter so i dont think theres any substantive change it remains a competitive market and clients are clearly aware of rate and the competitive rate environment on the consumer and the small business commercial side so its a transparent market huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 i think what has happened part of what were seeing is and im giving you guidance on this not just whats happening right now in the market but the outlook for the whole year and so thats really i think the way you should interpret these comments is whereas before there was a fairly strong conviction of the marketplace thinking about prior guidance ranges had the first cut beginning somewhere between march and august clearly that timeframe for cuts has been pushed out and so the period of time before we can begin to manage substantive downgrade actions thats just been extended and thats really the main driver here i think the our pricing strategy is pretty much the same which is continue to price in competitive ways but not lead the market to be clear and really drive the fundamentals of deposit growth from customer acquisition we talked about primary bank relationship growth in consumer in business banking growing on the commercial side as well so thats the underpinning of the pricing strategy is really just designed to ensure that theres fair and appropriate pricing as we got on those deposits r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect and i think you actually touched on sort of my loan growth questions in prior responses so that does it for me i appreciate the color zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah thanks so much operator thank you next question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan chase company your line is now live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc not to beat a dead horse on the net interest income guidance but last quarter with three cuts that got us to the high end of the range and now three cuts to get us to the low end of the range and im somewhat confused zach i always think your hedge fund magic keeps as relatively stable over short periods of time im a little confused why three cuts now put us down versus up last quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah thats a good question i appreciate it and i think what ill just bring you back to is the sort of two key things here overall the nim outlook for us in both scenarios is a few basis points lower mainly as a function of huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 the timing of when rate reductions will begin and when well see substantive down beta actions to somewhat higher funding cost environment than we expected and thats really the main driver second thing i would say is the four key factors for us that are driving the nim this year remain the same the biggest positive factor is fixed asset repricing we tried to share in the prepared remarks that we expect to see about billion quarterly repricing of fixed assets which should drive substantive benefit on the order of between and even or basis points depending on how the belly of the curve maintains here over the course of this year the second positive factor is a gradual reduction to the amount of hedge drag weve got in the nim in q1 we had basis points of hedge drag and i expect to see something between to up to to maybe even basis points again depending on how the curve moves here over the course of the rest of this year until q4 those are the two biggest positive factors the other two factors are whats going on with the variable yields and whats going on with funding costs those are largely offsetting each other in both of the for those moving on the direct opposite directions to be clear in either a higher rate cut or a lower rate cut scenario and those are modestly negative for the full year that would offset those positives and keep the overall nim in the generally flat to rising position from here so none of that has really changed the last thing i would say a third point is that all of the modeling were doing continues to indicate that a higher rate scenario overall all things equal drives a higher nim for us clearly how this plays out over such a short period of time three quarters will be really depending on the shape and trajectory and timing and everything but thats the best we can do and i think the guidance were trying to give here with this range of scenarios is designed to allow us to give you stability in terms of the revenue guidance which ultimately is the most important bit steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it zach if we put all this together youre seeing nii bottomed in the first quarter but i didnt hear you say nim bottomed in the first quarter does that imply nim has not bottomed in the first quarter zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc i expect to see nim bouncing around these levels or rising over the course of the rest of the year kind of depending on how the scenario plays out and for that kind of flattorising nim coupled with accelerated loan growth to drive accelerating net interest income on a dollar basis out of the first quarter into the second quarter of growth and then continuing to grow into the third and the fourth quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay but just one separate question on the noninterestbearing deposits balance is down pretty sharp average at periodend were seeing some of your peers showing in february and march good stability in those balances did you guys see that as well or did you see balances declining through the quarter thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 balances were modestly declining through the quarter as we look at that we would see a few things one is the trajectory of dollars of noninterest bearing actually decelerating in terms of the mix shifts secondly for the most part all of the mix shift that we think will happen in the same consumer has happened and where theres continued drift in q1 is really on the business in commercial side another point would be we expect the noninterestbearing mix shift mix of the percentage to continue to stabilize in the highteens over the course of this year with as of q1 and the last thing i would say is as you think about that percentage its very notable to measure that percentage if overall deposits are shrinking versus if theyre growing for us overall deposits are growing strongly as weve said so the mix is one thing but the dollars are really the most important thing and that we see is stabilizing here over the course of the next couple of quarters steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks for taking my questions operator thank you your next question today is coming from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now live ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just wanted to go back to something steve you mentioned i think in your prepared remarks you said that the outlook and the economy is more conducive for growth your message is probably the most upbeat ive heard over the last week if you dont mind spending some time in terms of breaking down what youre seeing from customers in terms of strength in loan demand looking into and beyond and how much of this change is just because of the proactive action huntington has taken to hire bankers in carolinas texas would love some color around both those aspects thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc thank you ebrahim the economy we obviously look at the aggregate metrics that are released and theres an underlying strength were seeing that particularly because weve been proactive with our lending activities through last year the core is performing well were getting growth in our auto book our distribution finance and particularly our business bank so very very localized levels principally here in the midwest were also getting growth in a number of our other areas and these new verticals that have been added theyve all closed ph modeled theyve all generated lending activity and other activity and the carolina huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 expansion and texas expansion are delivering results and look very promising to us so weve positioned the bank both with the core activities and the incremental investments i think to outperform peers in loan growth and perhaps in a number of other respects as well certainly through this year and potentially beyond the pipeline activity i referenced earlier is very promising and again the strength of the first quarter with every month improving gives us a lot of confidence our investment banking activity indiscernible related theyre pipeline is bigger than theyve ever had as an example so weve got a lot of opportunity in front of us and now we have to deliver ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that is helpful and zach a couple of followups for you one apologies on nii i feel like im more confused after some of this back and forth should we expect if we dont get any rate cuts or maybe or just one cut nii trends towards up is that the right takeaway zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc it will really be indiscernible take there so i think the outcome will be somewhere between that range of indiscernible when we give these ranges we try to generally box our plan and land in the middle of it but of course theres a bit of variance and just normal variability thats hard to forecast with such precision so thats the expectation i think well see as i noted and just to clarify a flat to rising nim a slightly higher nim in the higher rate scenario albeit with different drivers and really coupling that with accelerating loan growth will drive dollars out of the level weve seen in q1 up into q2 and beyond and to land for a full year somewhere in the middle of that range ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right so multiple scenarios middle of the range and any scenario where this could exceed up zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah certainly its possible indiscernible how the rate environment plays out here i think really just one were probably parsing the precision more than is reasonable its still a pretty moving target in terms of where the yield curve is now but i think well land somewhere in that range with our best estimate ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question is coming from ken usdin from jefferies your line is now live ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 hi thanks good morning and thanks for that incremental slide on the swaps detail im wondering if you can just kind of help us understand as we get through the end of this year both in terms of what that swaps impact looks like and as important that fixed rate repricing how should we think about those kind of combined benefits as we get out of and think about thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc yeah its a terrific question just maybe ill say a few things on that one is the fixed asset repricing benefit that we saw i mentioned earlier saw between basis points of upside this year from that billion turning quarterly our modeling indicates that that will continue on into with kind of a similar pace its really a very longterm phenomenon and that gives us a significant support to be able to get into on the hedge drag factor within nim that bps in q1 reducing down by something like to basis points i mean as much as basis points depending on the rate scenario lower by the end of q4 that should also continue on into the early part of as well probably get to about neutral position if there are some rate reductions and so if you just look at the rate curves all the rate curve there is an expectation in the forward curve at this point that there will be in fact reductions either in the back half of this year or certainly into the early part of next year and so if that comes to pass then well see that basis points sort of fully resolve by the middle of if there arent rate reductions then youd see less of that hedge drag coming back but obviously that will be a kind of very different environment overall regardless the other thing i will just say and you didnt ask me but ill share it is if you look at sort of the sum total of all of our hedging activities which as you know are always designed to protect capital against down rate scenarios protect nim in down rate scenarios that chart that i illustrated in the prepared remarks has the kind of a gradual shifting of that exposure as you get into and throughout the net result of that should be that by the end of asset sensitivity should be about a third less and so thats sort of the intent of that program more broadly from a interest rate risk and asset sensitivity management perspective ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay cool and then my followup ill separate them on just the fixed rate repricing on the asset side so we know about the meaningful help that you get this year but then how did that layer in in terms of incremental fixed rate benefit that happens into next year zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah so indiscernible i think its about the same benefit as we go out into and thats a fairly similar turn of quarterly volumes and continue to see the belly of the curve thats largely always indiscernible significantly higher than the historical rates of those assets over time of course youll begin to see that benefit reduce on a sequential basis and at some point it starts to asymptote but likely not until the latter part of at the earliest at this point based on how the curve is shaping up huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay my mistake zach i didnt separate the two in your answer my mistake zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc no worries appreciate the question operator thank you next question today is coming from jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets your line is now live jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey can you touch a little bit on the fee income outlook and what you expect there it seems like youre implying a bit of a stepup on that based on what you saw in the quarter but talk a little bit about what youre seeing there and then confidence in hitting that midpoint of the guide zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah q1 core fees grew about yearoveryear and our guidance of the full year is between and on a full year so that clearly implies were going to see an acceleration of fee income and acceleration on a yearover year basis as we look out this year and high confidence to achieve that the core drivers remain the same as what weve discussed on many prior occasions capital markets payments and wealth management if you look at sort of the trends were seeing right now and what their performance was in the first quarter payments revenue was up in the first quarter wealth revenue was up and capital markets we saw commercial bankingrelated revenues kind of around twothirds of the capital markets activities that are really highly correlated to the pace and volume of commercial banking that grew sequentially into the first quarter and was the second sequential quarter of growth there and i think one of the things that will power continued growth in capital markets from here is the fact that commercial loan production is likewise accelerating as steve noted earlier advisory revenues were really beginning to recover well in the back half of but typically seasonally lower in q1 for us in our focus in middle market advisory so we did see those advisory revenues lower to the first quarter but likewise our expectation for that is for continued expansion into the remaining part of this year pipelines look very good very high quality great firms that have contracted with us to look for ma support and so those are really the drivers from here huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 payments continuing to perform well continuing to execute the strategy and then capital markets driving acceleration as well and overall we continue to feel really really good about landing somewhere in that full year sort of range jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good helpful i wont go back to net interest income but i do want to ask about credit your numbers obviously look good but anything you want to flag internally that youre seeing and im curious also what youre seeing externally from a credit point of view thank you brendan a lawlor a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey this is brendan ill take that one i think as you sort of noted in your question that the story of the quarter is stability we across all of the credit metrics are pretty much in line with where we reported into the fourth quarter or seasonally adjusted when you think about delinquencies looking back at first quarter of last year were right in line and we feel really good about the position that were sitting in right now if theres the one place that everybody continues to focus on and talk about and were highly focused on it ourselves is office and the commercial real estate side but as weve talked about in the past we have one of the smaller books relative to our office portfolio and we have a decent reserve against it so we while were watching it and actively managing it we feel very well protected against it at this point stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc just to add to that thanks brendan weve reduced the office portfolio by about million over the course of the last four quarters and our largest loan is ph million the average is millionish so its very granular and it gets a lot of attention we expect it will continue to reduce throughout this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good if i can ask one more im going to violate the one and one followup but just bigger picture theres been this myopic focus on the margin and net interest income do you guys do you feel incrementally better or worse about that plus or minus guide because on one hand were thinking about a lower margin in the very near term and i get that but it seems like its higher funding cost to fund loan growth which seems to be at the higher end of it so i guess the question is with some of these new developments do you feel better or worse about that higher or lower end of the net interest income guide i think that would help people thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah great question jon ill take that one look ph two things i would make first is we feel really good about the overall performance of the business for us its about executing longterm growth longterm value creation and q1 set that up really well weve seen confidence in loan growth accelerating great core funding and therefore the confidence in being within that range is very strong at the margin my revenue outlook is a touch lower than was the case before and but i think were in a range of tuning at this point jon and hence we should not overly parse this somewhere in that range as we try to land in the middle of the ranges that weve given huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you appreciate it operator thank you next question is coming from peter winter from da davidson your line is now live peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning i wanted to zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc hi peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co follow up hi i want to follow up on jons question just on credit if i look at the acl ratio its at the top end of the peers and credit is really holding in and you feel good about the economy how are you thinking about reserving going forward is the plan to keep the acl ratio fairly steady and just kind of support loan growth brendan a lawlor a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah peter its brendan ill take a swing at that youre noting the stability quarteroverquarter and thats accurate i think as we look forward its really a factspecific as to how the acl coverage will move quarterover quarter as we take into account the modeling of our economic scenarios the view of credit at that time as well as the loan growth that you referenced in your question we put all of that into the mix to sort of drive out of our modeling what we believe the right level of coverage is and so its harder for us to for anybody frankly to in this environment to really give any strong guidance as to which way the acl will move as its really quarterly its a quarterlyspecific metric these days the way its run so its hard for me to come out and say we think itll do this and we think itll do that peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc peter this is steve ill just add to that we try to be conservative with reserves over the years we believe were in that posture today and we expect to grow loans above peer this year and potentially beyond with the investments in these new businesses and regions weve made and theres still a lot of uncertainty about where rates are going to go when theyre going to move the geopolitical tension the uncertainties that can spawn from elections both ours and other countries so we just try to be conservative at this stage should we continue to perform at the level we are there will be reserve recapture at some point huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks steve just one quick followup just that comment that youre feeling better about loan growth how much of the loan growth acceleration is new markets versus just core strength and is part of that positive outlook given the early success that youre seeing on the new initiatives zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc this is zach ill take that one if you look at the fullyear loan growth outlook that weve got its between and about of that growth we think will come from the core and about from these new organic expansion areas we discussed within and the mix of the overall companys growth will be weighted toward commercial but consumer also growing pretty well so thats the kind of broad answer in terms of the magnitude of them and really the other point is yes the early traction is really very positive were seeing customers already being acquired loans being booked and the pipelines across all of the five new areas of focus to the three commercial verticals carolinas and texas the pipeline cumulatively is approaching billion of loans and also very significant deposit pipeline remember these are tend to be full relationship strategies that are gathering loans but also deposits also fee income businesses in capital markets and payments and treasury management so indiscernible good early traction here obviously starting from a low base as steve mentioned so were going to see that build here over the course of time the last thing ill say is out of those five the most significant contributors in we expect to be the fund finance vertical and the carolinas over time the others will also be very significant particularly texas but just in terms of the early momentum that were seeing and based on when theyve started and were staffed those two will be the most significant for peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co and just one last final does the core loan growth assume a pickup in line utilization zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc not in substance so if you think about kind of the three big areas that we have outstanding lines in the broad middle market commercial lines we saw that tick up just a tiny bit into the first quarter pretty flat and its not our expectation that that will change substantively from here the second one being distribution and finance and that one we did see a benefit into the first quarter from but that was the typical seasonal pattern we think that line generally now has been at a stable level broadly and were just going through the typical seasonal pattern its highest in the first quarter its lowest in the third quarter just based on the kind of the cycles of inventory and sales and then the last one is auto floorplan we did see that also benefit us somewhat into the first quarter but again we think were now at a point coming out of covid particularly in the auto floorplan business where manufacturing has reached a stable level relative to sales in order to see line utilization generally trending in a pretty consistent area from here in the floor plan business so not counting on it really for the continued growth although certainly benefiting from some previous seasonality in the first quarter huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc and each of those businesses zach referenced we expect net increase in customers so theyll have core organic growth thats a primary driver peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it thanks i appreciate all the color operator thank you the next question today is coming from matt oconnor from deutsche bank your line is now live matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning most of my questions have been answered but just from an industry point of view are there any updates on the debit card interchange reform and remind us how meaningful that could be for you guys and if any of thats incorporated in guidance which i assume its not but any updates on that front thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vp huntington bancshares inc yeah good question matt thanks so the answer is no broadly no substantive updates in terms of where that may be going if for us weve got a really strong debit card franchise its one of the best in the country in terms of relative penetration and utilization within our consumer and small business base and so thats a real benefit to us if you were to just run the numbers on the proposal as it was proposed i think its around a million annualized impact for us with that being said if history is a guide often those proposals are changed substantively between the time they were initially put forth and when enacted either to not going to indiscernible at all or to be substantively altered and so well see for us in our payments strategy theres so much growth opportunity and so many opportunities to engage our customers that there will be over time ways to mitigate some of that and certainly offset it with other payments related growth as best we can tell at this point to the extent there is a proposal it would be at some point mid to latter part of it will take effect and so not in the guidance for as you just heard operator thank you we reached the end of our questionandanswer session id like to turn the floor back over to steve for any further or closing comments stephen d steinour chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc so in closing were pleased with our first quarter results were seeing momentum build across the bank which will drive improved performance over the course of the year and beyond we clearly expect our investments in our businesses to deliver growth this year and in the future the balance sheet is wellpositioned ample capital and robust liquidity to support our growth initiatives our focus remains centered on driving core revenue growth carefully managing expenses and growing with our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q1 earnings call 19apr2024 just as a reminder the
