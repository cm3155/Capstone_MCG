significant progress made by our team in many areas you will hear from john and will about the excellent progress and results we have had at the halfway point of with the many uncertainties that exist in the economy today it gives me confidence for our shareholders that the many strengths of south state will stand out regardless of the external environment our team our balance sheet our diverse customer base and our markets are well positioned for solid consistent performance in our three focus areas soundness profitability and growth ill now turn the call over to john for more details on the quarter john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp thanks robert good morning everyone generally speaking this has been a good quarter for the banking industry as a whole but its been an exceptional quarter for south state and the positive momentum its broad based we saw positive trends in everything from revenue growth expense control loan growth deposit betas and asset quality with the volatile swings of cecl reserves over the last year and with the change in our share account from the atlantic capital acquisition the best measurement of core earnings growth in this environment is ppnr per share for the second quarter ppnr per share increased from the prior quarter and on a yearoveryear basis ppnr per share is up this steep earnings ramp is a function of our liquid balance sheet rising rates a low deposit beta extense focus and strong organic loan growth and with more fed hikes on the way theres room for earnings to accelerate from here the fed funds rate is up basis points this year and our cost of deposits only increased basis point we ended the quarter with a total cost of deposits of bps and we were able to hold our deposit balances flat so our deposit beta is less than so far but will naturally pick up as we move through the cycle during the last rate cycle our end of cycle beta was which was below industry peers and it should be a relative advantage this cycle as well our plan is to hold deposit stable for the remainder of the year since weve got plenty of cash on hand to fund their loan growth credit quality remains excellent net chargeoffs decreased and leading asset quality indicators such as past dues and substandard loans also declined over the last year weve been releasing loan loss reserves for a total of million released in the prior four quarters the cecl forecast during the pandemic were too punitive and the reserves werent necessary this quarter we reverse course and we set aside a million provision even with the extra provision we ended up with a return on tangible common equity of about and with our net interest margin on the rise our adjusted efficiency ratio improved to down from in the prior quarter so a nice 6point drop revenue increased and thats in comparison to expenses only up so we saw excellent operating leverage of from the prior quarter weve still got opportunities to become more efficient and as we previously announced were on track to consolidate of our branches this quarter and on top of that weve also got the planned cost saves from atlantic capital we completed the system conversion this past weekend and were on track for the cost savings to be realized in the fourth quarter south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 population growth continues to fuel our economy in the southeast and theres no sign of it slowing so in many cases our clients are enjoying record operating results and theyre investing in the future over the course of the last year weve had organic loan growth of in the second quarter loan growth accelerated to annualized and was broadbased every loan category grew at double digits led by the residential and the cni portfolios were not a refi shop so mortgage production remains surprisingly steady in the second quarter at billion despite the rate increases but with listings at record lows theres more construction activity now and weve also seen a pickup in our physician program our professional and physician loan program made up of our residential production in the quarter weve got a new slide in the deck thats pretty interesting it illustrates how weve arrived at the decision to sell mortgages when gain on sale margins are high and the coupon rate is low which is what happened during the pandemic now the opposite is true gain on sale spreads are low and the coupon rates are much higher so logically were holding more production on the balance sheet as we look ahead we are seeing signs that the economy is cooling off and we think thats a good thing the housing and labor markets have been white hot to the point its not healthy and its not sustainable in the long run so the interest rate hikes are having an impact loan growth will slow in the back half of the year from this quarters level of and we now anticipate that loan growth in will be at the top end of our guidance at about ill flip it over to will and he can walk you through the rest of the numbers william e matthews senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thanks john as you noted it was a very encouraging quarter for us on several fronts if i were to give a high level summary of the quarter id say we held the pod constant and redeployed billion of cash and fed funds sold into loans while our spread benefited from the strength of our core funding base id also note good expense control with our noninterest income business is performing close to expectations as ph i make my remarks ill remind everyone that we had atlantic capital in the company for the full quarter versus only one month in the prior quarter so we have to keep that in mind as we make the income statement comparisons with the sequential quarter slide shows our fivequarter nim history the quarters net interest income of million was a record with our nim expanding by basis points from q1 reaching this was a million increase in net interest income or approximately million if you normalize for a full quarter of atlantic capital in q1 loan yields excluding ppp grew by basis points and earning asset yields increased by basis points and our cost of deposit rose by only basis point accretion was million for the quarter and our core nim excluding accretion and ppp rose basis points to for the quarter our billion in loan growth equated to a annualized growth rate which brings the last four quarters loan growth to we held deposits and the securities portfolio essentially flat except for aoci moves and our cash fed funds sold balances were down billion noninterest income of million was up million from the first quarter but essentially flat when normalized for a full quarter of atlantic capital as noted on slide of our billion in mortgage production was indiscernible and only of production was sold in the secondary market so mortgage revenue declined to million for the quarter ill pause here to note that this means that our first half of mortgage south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 production was essentially flat with the same period last year in a year where the industry is down approximately housing supply constraints have continued to drive nice volume in our construction ph firm product as john noted slide shows the relationship between rates the gain on sale margins and our portfolio versus secondary breakout youll see that when rates are low and gain on sale margins are high we have tended to sell most of our production conversely as rates move up and gain on sale margins decline the portfolio percentage increases youll also note on that same slide that even with the second quarters growth in portfolio loans our ending consumer real estate portfolio is only back to the size that it was in the first quarter of the correspondent division as shown on slide had another good quarter with million in revenue similar to q1 levels this environment continues to be better for our interest rate swap capital markets business while fixed income is a bit weaker our wealth management business also continues to perform well with respect to expenses our million in nie was up million from q1 but atlantic capitals premerger run rate was approximately million per month or an additional million for three months versus one month in q1 so we showed some improvement quarteroverquarter as john noted our revenue growth outstripped our expense growth by so we had a very good operating leverage this quarter similarly this operating leverage was also reflected in the improvement in our efficiency ratio to looking ahead to the next few quarters with merit increases effective july our expense guidance will be consistent with what we said on the last quarters call quarterly nie in the low potentially in the high in q4 on credit we had million in net chargeoffs or three basis points and only million of these were net loan chargeoffs with the rest in deposit overdraft losses as noted on slide our past dues and npas declined and we also saw a further decline in criticized and classified assets with respect to provision expense were cognizant of the increasing risk of a recession and we thus took a more conservative approach in our cecl modeling this quarter again increasing our weighting of the moodys s3 scenario this led to a million provision expense which brought our ending reserve to basis points of loans or basis points including the reserves for unfunded commitments as is outlined on slide turning to capital given the strong loan growth we were experiencing we did not conduct any further repurchase activity in the quarter beyond the  we repurchased in early april the annualized loan growth and those early april repurchases combined to cause a slight decline in our regulatory capital ratios though they remain strong with a cet1 ending at with approximately of our investment portfolio classified as afs the move in rating for the second quarter caused an additional decrease in aoci dropping our tce ratio to and our tbv per share to given the high quality nature of our portfolio we dont view this accounting convention requiring a mark on only one component of the balance sheet as being a meaningful longterm measure and we expect these securities to ph accrete to par as they approach maturity over time ill turn it back to you john john c corbett chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 thanks will just some closing thoughts im incredibly proud of our team and what theyve accomplished this quarter a lot of folks worked through the night on saturday and sunday to complete the atlantic capital conversion and as always they rose to the challenge also we just passed the second anniversary of the closing of the moe our five priorities headed into the merger were to preserve the culture to invest in digital to protect the soundness of the balance sheet and to position the company for top quartile profitability and growth were now harvesting the benefits of those priorities our digital platforms have been upgraded were situated in the best markets in the country our relationship managers are hitting record production and our ppnr per share grew over the past year we now have a franchise that is built to last and in perfect position to take share from the large banks over the next several years operator please open the line for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from stephen scouten of piper sandler your line is open please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thanks good morning so i just wanted to start maybe on the share repurchase plans i wasnt sure will you were saying there at the end completely i know you said you didnt repurchase any additional from the tce so would you think you would kind of hold back on the share repurchases in the near term given the afci moves or whats the logic there william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah stephen good morning our philosophy has always been our first priority for capital generation and investment of capital is in growth and given the strong growth we had in the quarter loan growth we curtailed our securities purchases based up on that growth i think for the foreseeable future were likely to be less active with share repurchases depend upon how growth shakes out from here but at present time i would expect us to continue to redeploy capital into the balance sheet as opposed to repurchasing shares stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay good and then i guess i think in one of the slides that noted you guys were focused on some upgraded tech solutions and continuing to push further into digital and you set some future goals for digital adoption i think throughout the slide deck so i just wanted to kind of understand if all of those investments have already been made or if theres any largescale incremental investments that need to be made to reach these targets how we should think about future tech spend john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 yeah stephen its john were continuing to transition our expense base from the brickandmortar into technology theres a slide in the back of the deck that talks about our branch consolidation efforts over the last decade weve got another branches that were consolidating this quarter but we made a lot of technology investments into new platforms a couple of years ago during the merger of equals so weve got ncino in place for commercial loan processing a brandnew mobile app through q2 sales force so really we believe weve made the significant investments on the software platforms that needed to be made and now weve got to mature into those platforms moving forward our technology investments will largely be around ways to become more efficient through robotics and the operations areas of the company as well as data analytics so it wont be near the lift going forward in the next year or two as it has been in the last few years stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thats really helpful and then i guess last thing for me is im just curious kind of about capital markets you guys have noted thats a pretty big differentiator for you all at the size of your bank helps you compete with larger banks are there any capabilities youre focused on within that capital markets team that you feel like you need to expand or develop further and i guess followon to that is is that an area we could potentially see some bolton acquisitions if there are some of those expansions needed or desired stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey stephen its steve that capital markets group has been part of our correspondent group for the last decade or so and we continue to recruit talent in that area right now its primarily focused in on our interest rate swaps weve got some other capabilities that were working on but probably not big enough to mention right now but thats an area as we marry the billion balance sheet along with the distribution we have into banks money managers and others thats clearly an opportunity for growth but thats going to take time and continued build out but were real happy about that team and what the base we have today in that team but that continues to be an opportunity to grow up in the future stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks for the color everyone and congrats on a phenomenal quarter john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp thank you stephen operator our next question in the queue today comes from kevin fitzsimmons of da davidson your line is open kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co just curious if you could dig a little deeper into the drivers of nii in what your outlook for continuing to grow that in the future is so obviously wed come off a period the last few years where its mainly been driven by the balance sheet where the percentage margin has gone down where now that seems to be reversing or flipping and the percentage margin is going up and average earning asset growth for most banks weve seen has been slower or even flat given pressure on deposits so just curious if you can give some of those dynamics in terms of for instance do you see the margin having the same kind of expansion what you saw this quarter within average earning assets i would think youve already talked about the loan growth but how low can that cash go what about securities will you continue to use that to fund loan growth so just digging into a few of those items thanks stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey kevin this is steve thats a mouthful but ill do the best i can hey just a couple of thoughts kind of big picture and then maybe i can drill down further in your question i think we have a slide in there i think weve had it in there for the last several quarters but it really speaks to balance sheet management and its slide number page which talks about our cash as a percentage of assets and it compares us versus peers and our securities peers and what it shows is we came into this year with about of our balance sheet in cash so it just gives us a lot of flexibility now were as we funded loan growth significant loan growth kept the balance sheet flat youve seen our cash assets still be at so its a really good position to be billion in cash we would normally in normal times run that in to range of assets thats generally how we would think about it so as weve communicated before in prior calls but kind of what were looking for over the next call it months at the end of is just try to keep a flat balance sheet flat deposits and flat interest earning assets and the way we think we can maneuver that is through the cash we have on the balance sheet and that will take our loan to deposit ratio from up to or so by the end of so thats how were thinking about balance sheet management clearly the rate environment has changed and theres just a lot of different things to think about there but thats how were currently and have thought about it over the last couple of years as we think about sort of the assumptions for margin the fed has kind of guided us towards a fed funds rate peak at the end of the year thats what the markets telling us and then well see if we get there another fundamental assumption around our margin is we have a page in there talks about a historical betas and our historical deposit betas on page was around for the cumulative beta were assuming thatll be the same this cycle as it was last cycle so if you think about that forecast deposit cost would get in the basis points to basis points in the middle of next year assuming that we get to a fed funds rate so anyway based on all those assumptions we would expect there to with a flat balance sheet we would expect margin expansion from here and that maybe sometime in early to mid2023 we get to a margin give or take as we said last quarter each 25basispoint hike to us is worth about basis points nim so depending on that the fed doesnt get to then you can subtract basis points for every hike they dont get there but thats kind south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 of how were thinking about the balance sheet management over the next to months and as well as the interest rate environment so im hopeful thats helpful kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co yeah thats very helpful thank you for that detail and one last piece on the balance sheet securities would that likely be more of a funding source or keeping that stable going forward given the positive outlook on loan growth stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah our expectation with the loan growth will just keep the securities a bit flat i think our securities assets on the page is around so in that to range would probably be right unless something changes in the rate environment materially that would be our expectation kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks steve and one last housekeeping on the purchase accounting was up ph still higher this quarter just will wondering what a decent run rate to think of that going forward stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah kevin this is steve it was basis points to margin this quarter thats high there were some payoffs ph and ill let those things are always hard to predict but our expectation is that it would be basis points to basis points kind of in the next over the next months thats probably what it would add to margin this quarter it was a little high at basis points so thats somewhere between million and million a quarter something like that kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co got it okay thanks very much appreciate it operator our next question today comes from jennifer demba of raymond james sic truist securities your line is open john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp jennifer ph we noted youve changed firms jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc no no truist securities good morning a question on loan growth you said it would definitely moderate in the second half of the year im just wondering what youre seeing in your pipeline is it lower than it was a quarter ago or is this based on more client selectivity and conservatism curious as to what youre seeing south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp yeah jennifer its john the pipeline is on the commercial pipeline side its relatively flat it was about billion at the end of the first quarter and its also still about billion but what we are seeing is that we are losing some cre deals to what we believe is overly aggressive competition on structure and rate and then secondly with the rise in rates we are seeing selectively some borrowers walk away from deals with the rate environment increasing whats going on right now is that the cap rates really have not adjusted yet to what the yield curve has done and i think a lot of the cre folks are kind of on the sidelines waiting for that lag effect to happen and valuations to reflect the higher yield curve so we do see things slowing down and we are seeing it slow down as well on the residential side the amount of house activity is declined naturally with the interest rate environment so i think we guided to upper single digits to growth for the calendar year weve done about organic loan growth annualized in the first half so if we wind up in the back half of the year in the midsingle digits that gets us roughly to organic loan growth for jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc great thanks so much operator our next question today comes from michael rose of raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys i guess i could be from truist if you want me to william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp good morning john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc switch it up a little bit most of my questions have been asked and answered but just looking at the beta slide which i appreciate again and then look at slide with the rate scenarios and the plan to let the loantodeposit ratio kind of grind higher up to it seems to me like some of those assumptions could be perhaps a little bit conservative can you just give us some color as to what the drivers of that rate sensitivity look i know cash is down but cash levels are still fairly healthy youre going to keep the securities book deposit outflow like i mentioned it just seems to me like some of those assumptions could end up being a little bit conservative south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah michael its steve and maybe will can add to it i guess from our history all we can model is history and as we think about our balance sheet what were hearing from our bankers and what were telling us in the market relative deposit costs this is sort of our history of what were going to model whats different this time is theres two things one is the loantodeposit ratios in the industry are much lower to begin with but were on a quantitative tightening cycle too that is probably as larger than weve ever seen so those kind of to me offset each other and then obviously we have a lot of flexibility with our cash sitting on the balance sheet at or billion so were going to try to manage excess deposits as you know we want to grow relationships and we will but sometimes our clients have access deposits and well make judgments on when to let them go into like our private client group and our wealth group there might be better opportunities to earn better yield in those cases we still control the operating accounts and the funds but they may not be on our balance sheet so those are the things were going to have to manage going forward but the history is the best thing that we can look forward to in the future but will william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah and just one other difference i guess michael relative to prior cycles is just the speed and the size of the moves this time around versus what weve had in the past so all those factors make it difficult to model our thought would be we certainly would love to do better but i dont think we would recommend modeling more aggressive than the margins that steve outlined earlier michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then maybe just and going back to the loan growth and the outlook i mean as i sit here and i look at the slide i mean the production has been really really strong the paydowns have slowed and thats all been good i sense a little tone of cautiousness in kind of the prepared comments and some of the answers to the questions but are you really seeing any sort of pullback at this point i know pullthrough rates have been pretty strong this quarter and maybe pipelines arent as full as they were but theres i think what ive heard from others is theres an expectation that those will rebuild as we move into yearend so just trying to just get a sense if you guys are perhaps being a little bit more conservative especially with the boost that you get with from acbi thanks john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey michael its john so naturally we are adjusting our underwriting criteria based upon the increase in the yield curve so our the interest rate that we used for underwriting weve ph chalked it up a fair amount so when you size credits we are being maybe more conservative than we were historically but if you kind of just look at the different asset classes as far as activity were seeing good activity in multifamily and decent activity in selfstorage industrial has slowed down and this is some of this is the amazon effect and the only exception to that would probably be the savannah area because the port activity is so strong office activity theres very little activity in office and we feel good about our book of business there thats one were watching over of our offices are suburban rather than metro retail theres some activity with certain south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 select franchises dollar general publix truckers supply and starbucks still expanding so that kind of gives you a flavor of what were seeing in the cre market housing will slow down with higher interest rates theres a lot of construction activity that were doing because inventories are so low but in total there will be a decline there so thats our best judgment when the fed increases interest rates it has an effect and i think a lot of our borrowers are watching and want to see where this economy takes them and being a little more cautious as well as us being a little more cautious stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah i think michael ill just add just on the residential side i mean you saw mortgage rates get to 625orso percent now they are down so this market has been really hard to catch if youre a borrower so it needs to settle in a little bit in order for growth to resume at those levels i think and well just have to see michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay i appreciate the color maybe just one final quick question for me i know its the dollar amount of non accrual loans ticked up anything to read into that william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp no michael its will i dont theres really nothing to read into that theres no that doesnt signify any trend indiscernible i think it may have been one loan michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc but i think the total dollars of npas declined right william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah yeah and as john said earlier our early warning things indiscernible like that all have good trend lines as well so right now we feel like all those indicators look very good michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect i appreciate all the color guys thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question in the queue comes from david bishop of hovde group please go ahead south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc yeah good morning gentlemen thanks for taking my questions john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp hey good morning david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc i think in the preamble you noted that operating expenses you expect some inflationary pressure here in the third quarter up to the low maybe coming back to the high just curious and i appreciate the slide on slide in terms of the planned branch consolidation but maybe what are some of the puts and takes that are causing that inflationary pressure is it going to purely merit raises compensation or is going to be spread out elsewhere among the expense line items thanks william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah dave its will its predominantly in the conversation indiscernible so we have our merit increases kick in july so thatll be fully evident beginning in the third quarter we also raised our teller our frontline pay in the middle of the second quarter so well have a full quarter of that that kicks in and im sure youve heard a lot of other calls too where this is an environment with tight labor supply and a lot of inflationary pressure and to ph fill in all that on the positive side we have some additional atlantic capital cost saves to realize itll be more evident in the fourth quarter the branch closing cost saves kick in there as well so all of those puts and takes kind of led to that guidance of the low and maybe getting to high in the fourth quarter david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc got it appreciate that guidance and then you noted that the increase in the loan loss provision this quarter there was did i hear right there were some change in some of the cecl assumption and modeling there just curious what played into that william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah i mean maybe ill back up a second talk about our cecl process i think we have a very healthy process its a committeebased process and what the committee does is in addition to receiving the moodys forecast and in addition to just reading the numbers they put out actually reading the forecast themselves and what the verbiage is around that and compare that to what we read in other publications and hear out in the market and whatnot and based upon the assimilation of all of that the committee has some healthy discussions around essentially do we think that moodys scenarios are right on the money or are they too pessimistic or too optimistic and that varies quarter by quarter we have for the last few quarters felt like we needed to be more conservative more pessimistic if you will than what moodys was saying so we have steadily increased the weighting of their s3 which is their south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 recessionary scenario its not a great financial crisistype scenario but a recessionary scenario to where it is now more than half and we also have overlaid some qualitative factor adjustments as well based upon all that as you can see from a percentage standpoint it essentially left our reserve flat with last quarter and so with a indiscernible loan growth and its keeping the reserves flat that has been generating that million provision number but thats really kind of how the process works and that was really our thinking just everything we read seemed to be people talking more and more about the likelihood of a recession david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc and then as we sort of model indiscernible with the moderation in loan growth from a indiscernible target are you targeting a dollar amount of reserves with potential or a ratio im just curious how we should think about the overall amount as a percent of loans william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp yeah i wish i could tell you indiscernible all of us were not in either case dollar or floor amount were really working with the loss driver forecasts that come out and sort of if unemployment and housing price index and cre index and things like that the gdp for our region if those things change dramatically to the better or for the worse in terms of their forecasts thats going to drive statistically a higher or lower reserve requirement and then we based on what we see in those and what we see in other things we may weigh the baseline or the more pessimistic scenario more or less but its really too hard to give you i know it makes it hard to model but its hard for us to model internally too until we know what those loss drivers how theyre going to change david j bishop q analyst hovde group llc no i probably got it thank you for the color william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp thank you operator the next question in the queue comes from catherine mealor of kbw please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone john c corbett a chief executive officer director south state corp good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wanted to go back to the margin and talk about loan yields for a little bit i mean i think as we think about your margin trajectory no ones going to argue that deposit betas were a little less cycle and will be low again this south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 cycle but i think the loan yield piece is harder to model because of all the acquisitions and accretable yield and all that thats in that historical number so as we think about loan yields moving forward steve you mentioned the kind of bps margin as we kind of head into next year how are you thinking about the repricing of loan yields and maybe where that gets back to a certain level as we kind of head towards that bps margin and how quickly we see loan yields reprice as well stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah sure sure catherine we have a slide i guess slide which talks about our loan repricing and basically what it shows there is that we have about of our portfolio that flows on a kind of a daily basis so if you kind of run that through the model we started this whole cycle i think our loan yield in the first quarter was around ph million something like that and so if you kind of just look at 100basis point increase in the fed funds rate would move your loan yield up basis points over a period of time so i think just thinking about the loan yield beta being sort of tied to that in sort of the id call it the threemonth range three or six month range and then after that youll of course have higher loan yields as you reprice some of the older fixed rate stuff on your books so i think the best way to think about it is the sort of the floating rate loan book which is somewhere between zero and three months is of our loan book and that would be pretty direct fed rate hike driver and then after that as you think about middle of the late it would be more just sort of the repricing of the five year fixed from wherever it was a couple of years ago to something in the if rates hold does that help catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc it does yeah it does and ph how about on the new production you saw this quarter ph weve ive sort of heard mixed reviews on where new pricing has gone maybe not as big of a move on the fixed rate side but just any kind of color you can give on how new pricing is going stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah ill just tell you that there was such a direct i think this is probably the same answer youve gotten from others there was such a dramatic movement in the rate cycle this past quarter that for your customers you lock in when you talk to your customers you lock them in for somewhere between and days depending on the type and product and so youre lock in rates in the production in june that you did in april indiscernible the things you did in april back in february so what we saw was we saw about a 50basispoint move or so from the lows to the highs in the quarter and you would kind of expect that so i think our average loan yield for this quarter new production yield was in the i dont know low but it started in bps so its probably hard to judge honestly at this stage just because of the movement rates catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah that makes sense okay great and then on service charges you saw really nice increase this quarter and im assuming thats acbi or just kind of a rebound off of the covid lows but any thoughts on the trajectory of service charges for the rest of the year and into next william e matthews a senior executive vice president chief financial officer south state corp south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 itd be a little bit of what you just said catherine and we like see some seasonality in the second quarter particularly the month of june and we saw a lot more just consumer activity in that month looking ahead thats sort of historical seasonality pattern weve had there it might tamp down a little bit from here but its hard to say with a lot of precision stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp yeah and i think catherine just the other thing to add is we didnt talk about in our last quarter about the changes we are making to our overdraft plan and thatll kick in in the third quarter and so thatll have an effect kind of going forward one of the things that as we think about fee income i know weve guided between its kind of a percentage of assets noninterest income to average assets i think we last quarter because of the acquisition of acbi we got it between basis points and basis points kind of the go forward run rate this quarter the past quarter we were basis points so kind of right in the middle of the range maybe a little higher than middle of the range as we think about the next couple of quarters and just particularly with our interest rate sensitivity businesses like correspondent and mortgage we think thats probably going to be on the lower end of the range between that basis points and basis points for the next quarter or two and then kind of rebound in the middle of the range in but with this volatility in the market we just sort of have to settle down before you kind of move higher so anyway hopefully all of that helps you model with your noninterest income catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah it definitely does great thank you and great quarter stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp thank you catherine operator operator instructions we have a question from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott your line is open christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks very much thank you for all of the information this morning as well and i want to drill down on the deposit growth and particularly the deposit accounts that you highlighted in the slides are you incenting any differently now and sort of how do you think about trying to push for more deposit growth just as you manage the balance sheet given steves comments earlier in the call stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp hey i mean chris this is steve i mean i think on the slide we talked about our deposit portfolio that of it is in checking accounts which either in dda or very low interestbearing deposit accounts and then we sort of break out the checking accounts its commercial small business and retail so its a pretty diversified portfolio and the way weve run our model depending on which area of the company you are there are markets that are more small business and retail kind of in the suburban markets and then there are more south state corp ssb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 29jul2022 markets like atlanta tampa orlando and charlotte that and miami which would be more commercial markets i think what we have seen particularly post moe is with the advent of a new treasury management platform as well as acbi coming on the commercial cash management portfolio continues to grow from a deposit perspective and the small business really has been pretty resilient that ph foray to a point where there might be a potential recession you could see some of those deposits balance is coming down a little bit and clearly on the retail side if some of that cash comes down so its really kind of hard to say we havent incented any differently than what we have done in the past but core deposits have always been a huge incentive metrics at our banks and even when rates were zero we still indiscernible because thats where we think the value of the franchise is christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great steve and just a related question on some of the state government and municipal relationships are there any behavior changes there of note stephen d young a chief strategy officer south state corp nothing to note typically what happens in those balances is they typically ramp up in the fourth quarter and then theyre here quite a bit for the first quarter and then they start draining down the second and third quarter so typically from a seasonal pattern they typically move up in the fourth and fourth quarter they sort of start draining in the first second and third and then back up in the fourth so theres really no trend to report where we do a lot of work in that business is we do a lot of in the small municipality range because were in a lot of small towns school districts so on and so forth so so far we havent seen a huge move in that but clearly as rates continue to move i would expect those to be reasonably sensitive and i believe i dont know that we disclosed this but we may have disclosed it in the past but i think our portfolios in the to range of deposits i dont remember exactly the number but its somewhere around billion give or take christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc sounds good thats what i recall as well thank you all very much for all the disclosure this morning john
