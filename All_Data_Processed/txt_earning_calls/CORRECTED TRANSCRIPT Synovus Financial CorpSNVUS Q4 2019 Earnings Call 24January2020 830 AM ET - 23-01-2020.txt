adjusted adjusted eps was down sequentially and up yearoveryear period end loan growth was million or annualized resulting from total funded loan production of billion period end deposit growth was million or annualized core transaction deposits increased million and total deposit cost declined basis points from the prior quarter net interest margin was a decline of basis points from the prior quarter excluding the impact of purchase accounting synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 adjustments the net interest margin was down basis points from the prior quarter noninterest income was million in the fourth quarter an increase of million from the prior quarter and million from the prior year quarter led by capital markets and fiduciary activities and credit quality metrics remain solid with the nonperforming loan ratio and the nonperforming asset ratio declining by basis points from the prior quarter to and respectively the net chargeoff ratio was we repurchased million in common stock or million shares during the quarter which completed our share repurchase authorization of million outstanding shares were reduced from beginning of the year our share repurchase authorization should allow us to continue operating with a cet1 ratio around im also pleased to report that our board approved a increase in the quarterly dividend to per share of common stock effective with the april dividend ill now turn the call over to jamie for a more detailed look at andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel lets begin on slide with loans we had another strong quarter of loan growth with a net increase of nearly million on production of billion the growth was broadbased with cre growing in of asset classes direct ci lending increasing across the footprint and the consumer book experiencing growth in all product types the credit profile of this growth was consistent with prior quarters and we remain confident in the quality of our loan book we have a robust loan pipeline across industries and in the footprint and were starting to benefit more directly from changes in the competitive marketplace following recent ma activity and industry consolidation on slide deposit highlights include a continued increase in core transaction deposits this is a direct reflection of our team members performance growing quality relationships across our footprint in the fourth quarter we continued our efforts to remix the deposit book by allowing highercost deposits to run off we offset that runoff with growth in noninterestbearing deposits money markets and the seasonal inflows for more reasonable priced public fund deposits this strategic focus supported continued reductions in the total cost of deposits which fell basis points from the peak in july and basis points from the previous quarter as you can see on slide the core net interest margin decreased basis points to excluding purchase accounting accretion lower interest rates resulted in a basis point reduction in loan yield and a basis point reduction in the cost of deposits as a reminder gaap margin at benefited from purchase accounting accretion which was million in the fourth quarter the benefit to nii from purchase accounting will decline substantially in to a full year total approximately million strong balance sheet pipelines and the timing of loan growth which was weighted towards the end of the quarter provide tailwinds going into on slide youll see we have had continued success in fee revenue growth which increased to million or million adjusted included in our gaap noninterest income is an million increase in the fair value of certain equity investments in the fourth quarter fee revenue growth was led by capital markets and fiduciary activities of million and million respectively which more than offset reductions in areas such as mortgage banking income noninterest income as a percentage of average assets continues to improve as we successfully execute on this key strategic objective an example of this success includes a yearoveryear increase in implementations by treasury and payment solutions slide shows adjusted expenses of million which is an increase of million from the previous quarter significant increases noted on the slide reflect a million increase in fdic expense associated with the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years expenses also increased with opportunistic revenueproducing hires and additional noninterest income there was also a million increase in servicing expense that was more than offset with higher revenue resulted from a renegotiation of a third party consumer lending partnership as we execute strategies from our new operating model we continue to recalibrate our expense base to emphasize the importance of customerfacing talent and technology these investments have shortterm paybacks that will serve the company well by improving efficiency and profitability longterm key credit quality metrics on slide remain favorable including npl and npa ratios that each declined by basis points these reductions were achieved with a net chargeoff ratio of basis points for the quarter the net chargeoff rate was basis points for the year provision expense of million included the costs associated with a million increase in net loan growth from the prior period provision expense remains elevated compared to net chargeoffs due to the impact of purchase accounting under our acquired loan accounting selection the credit mark flows through nii rather than provision as loans pay off or renew as we think about the overall allowance our coverage ratios remain favorable as credit quality continues to look healthy on to slide we remain confident in our overall capital position and are pleased to report that we completed the million share repurchase authorization in this included fourth quarter repurchase activity of million which reflected a reduction of an additional million shares total shares were reduced from the beginning of the year ongoing analysis continues to provide support for operating at our current capital and liquidity ratios and now kevin will discuss our outlook kevin blair president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thanks jamie before i talk about what we expect in let me take a minute to reflect on im very pleased with our progress and success achieved during the year as we rolled out a new operating model in the beginning of the year our objectives were to better align our organization to further enhance the customer experience as well as expand and diversify our sources of growth in we added net new revenue producing team members across our footprint in many of the fastestgrowing markets in which we serve various business units contributed to our growth including mortgage brokerage trust private wealth management wholesale banking and treasury and payment solutions the attraction of this talent helped move the needle in and will have an even bigger impact on we also experienced strong growth in banker productivity during the year with funded loan production of billion up billion or from moreover the increase in production led to a pro forma outstandings growth in total loans with ci cre and consumer asset classes all increasing in we also delivered fee income growth versus on a pro forma synovus fcb basis strong growth was delivered across multiple businesses including mortgage capital markets card and our fiduciary and asset management businesses which saw assets under management grow as we continue to expand our capabilities and presence across the footprint as a result of the growth in these categories we saw the percentage of our revenue derived from fee income increase throughout the year now totaling in the fourth quarter as we previously discussed we completed the integration of the florida community bank during the year and were pleased with the contributions of our newest team members the legacy fcb wholesale team continued on a path of growth with loans increasing million during the year deposit accounts growing by and record levels of capital market income of million up yearoveryear credit in the acquired fcb book also performed as we expected during the year with credit metrics and internal reviews supporting the overall quality of synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 the portfolio the legacy fcb branch network also saw performance gains in with branch unit sales per month of slightly higher than the legacy synovus branches we also invested in new technology and new business units to generate growth we released my synovus our consumer digital portal in and are preparing for the release of our commercial digital platform in in the middle of the synovus structured lending division was formed and in a very short period of time has already generated million in loan commitments we also spent the year building out and piloting a much stronger value proposition for the mass affluent customer segment and will release this program and the associated solutions across our franchise this quarter so as we enter our roadmap will follow a similar course it calls for opportunistic expansion and growth simplification and process enhancements that will make us even easier to do business with and additional efficiency efforts that will fund new investments while helping to mitigate the headwinds from the margin in building the strategic roadmap we engaged a third party back in september of the work over the last four months has informed our guidance but more importantly our longterm goals we have reviewed over initiatives that provide opportunities for incremental growth from the revenue side as well as additional efficiencies we are in the final stages of prioritizing the to initiatives that will be delivered during but generally the revenue opportunities have a longerterm horizon while efficiency opportunities will begin to be realized in our efficiency opportunities will center around the categories that have been constructive for us in the past third party spend real estate and staffing rationalization as we move forward with this engagement we will continue to provide updates and greater transparency around the opportunities as well as the progress now moving to our guidance and longterm targets these are based on a lower for longer rate environment and modest economic growth we believe that the economic tailwinds that have resulted in above average economic growth in the southeast will continue our clients maintain a favorable outlook on the business environment and we are focused on supporting their growth we are pleased with the positive momentum in the balance sheet growth which has been driven by new talent the enhancement of capabilities and sales tools as well as stronger growth in our larger tier1 markets our approach and the momentum is expected to continue to support asset growth of to in funded loan production increased throughout and ended the year with a robust pipeline funded by a remixed deposit base for we expect loan growth to exceed market economic growth as we further deepen existing relationships grow new relationships and continue hiring of frontline bankers we expect this to result in broadbased loan growth across markets and industries we will fund this growth with a continued focus on growing core transaction deposits our efforts to reduce highcost deposits will continue in as we selectively reduce highercost singleservice deposits one of the most significant headwinds to the income statement is purchase accounting adjustments which are expected to reduce revenues by approximately million from excluding paa adjusted net interest income should increase to as we continue to actively manage our balance sheet to optimize the margin as well as returns we do expect the net interest margin to be down slightly assuming flat interest rates and similar balance sheet mix adjusted noninterest income is expected to increase to with broadbased growth the continued growth in fee income is a function of hiring efforts in higher opportunity markets product areas such as treasury and payment solutions as well as an expansion of the share of wallet with existing relationships synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 adjusted noninterest expense is expected to increase to the primary drivers include continued investments in people processes and technology that will have relative shortterm paybacks these investments will be partially offset by savings realized during the execution of our strategic efficiency initiatives the tax rate of was negatively impacted by significant nondeductible mergerrelated expenses that are not expected in as well as certain discrete items that were also negative elimination of these aforementioned expenses as well as additional strategic tax initiatives and the realignment of certain subsidiaries will reduce the future effective tax rate substantially we expect a net chargeoff ratio of to basis points as the credit cycle matures and recoveries subside there are no indications of any widespread credit deterioration however net chargeoffs will be impacted by changes resulting from purchase accounting of the acquired portfolio as the credit mark is unwound at cecl adoption as we look forward to the largest change to financial statements involves cecl implementation provision expense will be elevated going forward as we provide for lifeofloan losses and will be highly dependent on the projected economic environment the credit profile and tenor of loans the impact of unfunded reserves as well as expectations of both net loan growth and a continuation of the current elevated levels of payoffs given our current profile of loan growth and expectations for the economy we anticipate adding up to basis points to the allowance for credit losses ratio throughout to account for the change in provisioning to the life of loans our estimated day cecl impact which remains unchanged from the previous quarter can be found in the appendix this incremental forecasted provision expense is not related to any changes in the underlying credit fundamentals of our loan book moving on to capital in we completed subordinated debt and preferred stock issuances and purchased million shares which effectively optimized the capital stack given the current balance sheet size and risk profile we reiterated our comfort with a cet ratio of under the current conditions and are committed to first funding organic growth second maintaining a competitive dividend and third effective capital deployment as such we will be increasing the common dividend by in targeting a payout ratio of to moreover we will monitor capital consumption through organic loan growth and tailor our share repurchases accordingly as we continuously manage our capital and liquidity positions our longterm goals reflect the successful execution of our strategic roadmap we are committed to aggressively identify and implement new avenues for growth and efficiencies throughout our organization im confident in our path forward in the passion and the commitment of our entire team and in the clarity of our vision to be the bank weve always been but better we have moved were moving forward fullyaligned with a keen eye on delivering on our goals of positive operating leverage diversified balance sheet growth and topquartile profitability metrics kessel ill turn it back over to you for closing remarks kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin and before we move to qa i again want to thank our synovus team for their contributions to another successful year for our company our results reflect continued momentum across our footprint with greater organic growth and an improving ability to execute well as a fullyunified team im always so proud of the way our team supports each other serves our customers and gives back to our communities operator were now available for questions synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and the first question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch i guess just first question wanted to looking at the expense guidance to how should we think about expense growth for the year is the lower end kind of tied to if revenue asset growth is at the lower end we should expect expenses to be at the lower end and is that the right way to think about where expenses could shake out or is it more incumbent on just investment decisions that youre making would love to get your thoughts in terms of just how we think about operating leverage for the year and also in terms of do we expect to get an update on the efficiency plan by the first quarter earnings or do you expect an update sooner than that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so ebrahim hi this is jamie thanks for the question we expect as we say to expense growth for and a lot of that has to do with things that happened in so we have about expense growth associated with third party servicing and so thats just growth in the book thats the renegotiation that also negatively impacted expenses this quarter another thing another impact are our hires we made in the second half of and so weve been really growing our first line out there in the field and thats going to be a negative impact to expenses as we head into youre right that growth will definitely impact that you saw that in the second half of with the commission expense being higher just because of the strong performance in fee revenue businesses and so youre right it is somewhat dependent on that but were excited about the opportunity to improve this and we have many initiatives in flight as kevin mentioned on the script talking about our opportunities for with our transformation efforts kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and ebrahim this is kevin ill answer to the question as it relates to additional transparency around the initiatives yeah i think at the first quarter earnings call well provide a little more clarity as to the initiatives themselves obviously when were giving guidance on the full year we want to understand what the third party spend will be in order to generate the savings but as jamie mentioned i think what youll see with our quarterly expenses is that well hit a high watermark in first quarter and then expenses will trail off as the year continues and so well be synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 able to generate positive operating leverage as we get towards the second half of the year and most certainly as we look at ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and just moving quickly to capital cet1 at relative to the target and you obviously raised the dividend this morning is it safe to assume that we should we may not see any buybacks at least early part of the year as you sort of gauge asset growth given your guidance and let capital build like whats the right way to think about buybacks from year on andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim we expect to maintain cet1 around the level where we are currently and we feel confident in that level and so youre right well be looking at how we grow our balance sheet and how that plays into capital ratios but i wouldnt assume that that means that well be holding off on share repurchases ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch so we could see or we should expect share repurchases in the first quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp were not giving guidance to the timing of share repurchases but were going to stay at the level as you look at that i would say with our forecast of loan growth and the guidance were giving we may repurchase million to million shares in and thatll probably be over the course of the year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thanks for taking my questions kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thank you ebrahim operator thank you and the next question comes from tyler stafford with stephens tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp hey tyler andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning tyler kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey i guess jamie im trying to just triangulate on expenses here the comment from last quarters call about looking at opportunities not just in the fourth quarter but in and to take out significant adjustments to the expense run rate relative to the fourth quarter expenses that we saw that stepped up fairly meaningfully and then i think the guide at to that was above expectations just i guess simply what happened to the outlook that i thought you guys were talking about on the third quarter call relative to what happened in the fourth quarter and the outlook here of to expense growth andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah tyler well id say a few things first we did have a lot of strong growth in the fourth quarter you saw the balance sheet growth you saw the fee revenue growth and so that contributed to our expenses we also had the renegotiation of the third party relationship that added million to fourth quarter expenses itll add as i mentioned a minute ago to ebrahim itll add another million or so to expenses as well but just as a reminder thats offset by a bigger impact in nii and so its accretive to the shareholder also in the fourth quarter we had fdic expense and that was related to the reclassification of certain loan categories over the past four years and when we went in and looked at that we also engaged a third party to identify opportunities to reduce the assessment rate going forward and so thatll actually be a net positive to but then we also had a higher compensation expense there are some ebbs and flows in compensation expense but we did have million higher due to certain legacydefined benefit plans that hit us in the fourth quarter we do feel confident about the efforts were making to reduce efficiency rate going forward as kevin mentioned we expect the first quarter to actually be a little higher due to the seasonal impact of personnel expense that probably is million to million but were excited about the work streams we have in play to help us improve our run rate going forward and help get back to positive operating leverage and were targeting returning to year onyear positive operating leverage in late tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay but to be clear the efficiency opportunities that youre speaking to that is already reflective in the to expense growth outlook is that right synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so the to outlook there are a couple things with that one that doesnt include any expenses associated with the transformation effort so ill be clear on that but the benefit to calendar year is not nearly as much as the benefit to run rate at the end of the year we expect to complete many of these initiatives that will improve both revenue and expense going forward but the impact to is not significant tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay so the exit expense base being i think what youre implying as the low point for the year that lower expense exit base should continue into providing greater efficiencies really in andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc and a lower expense growth rate andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp and tyler this is kessel let me just kind of maybe summarize what both jamie and kevin said to the question of what happened because one of you on the call ive already seen that question in an email this morning early nothing really happened what in effect has happened is that the investments we made in throughout the year but a lot in the middle and back end of the year have really paid off but those salaries those investments didnt go away as we entered but in the midst of all that weve been very thoughtful and quite frankly aggressive in taking out costs in the back half even in the fourth quarter with some reductions in staff throughout our company so i dont want to leave you with the impression that were weve forgotten about our commitment to expense control its just on this call today and i think you know this about us or me i dont like to guide to things that i dont see and so we are working very aggressively with a third party so that we can give you more color as to the amount of revenue opportunity and the amount of expense run rate shortterm and longterm and so i just to want make sure that you understand the commitment to executing on that is as strong as ever tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay thank you kessel synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks tyler operator thank you and the next question comes from brady gailey with kbw brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc well i think i heard something earlier in the call about the loan losses ratio being built at basis points i wasnt sure is that somehow related to cecl or are you referring to after cecl you expect to build the reserve by basis points throughout the rest of andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi brady this is jamie that we are referring to cecl and were referring to the day two impact on the allowance for credit losses as we look at and give guidance there cecl was impacted by multiple factors right like theres the impact of loan growth theres an impact of the credit components of loan mix theres an impact of prepayments if you have accelerated prepayments the average duration of your book extends and it negatively impacts your provision expense due to cecl theres the impact of unfunded commitments as well as the big impact of the general economic environment your assumptions that you put in there and so when we look forward on the day two impact of cecl we expect our allowance for credit losses to marginally increase as we go through the year clearly theres a lot of uncertainty were not forecasting any deterioration in the economy we think that using flat kind of economic assumptions that we still may see a slight increase in the allowance percentage as a percent of loans just due to the fact that the average duration of the book extends a little bit theres no change in the credit performance the forwardlooking credit indicators are all looking very good and strong right now its really just an impact of just forecasting slightly longer duration within the different portfolios synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then kessel its been a year since you closed fcb your currency has come back a little bit at least relative to where it was at some points back in any update on how youre thinking about ma in the next year or two kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp well year or two might be two different things brady i mean currency has come back some but not enough to i think position us to participate in a transaction right now as i think you probably know there is a lot of chatter out there there are a lot of smaller banks looking for exit partners i think we would all agree that there are a lot more sellers than there are buyers right now but were very very very focused on our internal operations on organic growth on improving our returns on controlling the expense growth that tyler and ebrahim both just spoke to so i think shortterm the answer is heads down internal focus keep building on the reputation that i think weve established keep proving the investment thesis on fcb as that team has really become fullyintegrated into our team and performing well throughout the entire state of florida so late this year i would just say that regardless of currency we will be very disciplined and again the thought being that if they were in the right opportunity where we have the right currency i think we would have to certainly look at something but i wouldnt anticipate that being a event and would assume i believe therell be plenty of sellers in as well brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks operator thank you and the next question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thank you good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp good morning jennifer synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc back to the expenses topic jamie i think you said that you expect the expense rationalization efforts to take to be more weighted towards the back end of the year does that bias your guidance for expenses core expenses of to growth does that bias it towards the low end of that guidance andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp jennifer i think that our guidance is i mean there are scenarios that can get within it gets you to the low end or the high end but we think that thats the right range we think our base case is right in the middle of the range but there are definitely opportunities to be at the low end and as kessel mentioned earlier were going to be looking at a lot of things that can move the lever faster as kevin mentioned on the call weve looked at over initiatives there are things that are teed up to go and in process right now and so i guess that guidance is the best i can give you right now but we feel good about it jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and question on hires how offensive will you be in on hiring off this person base last year kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp well jennifer i think that really colors that expense number as well because we have not backed off of on the hiring front and again i believe selfishly weve got a pretty attractive platform to hire to and we continue to add depth throughout our footprint in really all of our higher growth markets and will continue to do i actually spoke early this morning to allen barker whos our atlanta market president about the number of people that he and some of our other leaders here continue to talk to and as he said to me we have the opportunity to be very selective on who we hire because of the number of people who are interested in joining our team so i think well continue to be aggressive that puts pressure on that revenue number but while there is some disruption while there are good bankers in the market we certainly want to make sure that were front and center in that decision ive visited with kevin howard in atlanta just a couple weeks ago and spoke with a couple of people hes recruiting and again just seeing what attracts them to our company made me feel really good so well be aggressive but again disciplined i mean hiring comes with a cost because especially in the middle market space it takes a while to generate the revenue to cover that so well make sure we balance the hiring in terms of what can give us shorter term payback versus longerterm payback but i would say again the if you look at the last quarter growth in loans and the push in fee revenue it really does reflect the success of our hiring decisions throughout jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thanks jennifer operator thank you and the next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons with da davidson kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning everyone kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co just taking a step back a bit on the you said you engaged a third party back in september im just curious what the thought process was was it that you knew you had all these investments being made and you needed a way or wanted a way wanted to look at a way to offset that or was it more about looking versus peers where you stood on certain ratios im just curious the thought process before stepping in with that kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah ill take some of that kevin look i just think a fresh look is always good you know us as well as anybody on this call and in the past weve engaged a third party for major initiatives i remember like yesterday when it was million then we did a million a million and as we have grown as we have integrated another organization as we have made major investments and i dont want to not give credit to our team who has been very diligent in looking at ways we can take cost out we thought it was a good it had been a while since we had a really thirdparty fresh look at everything were doing how were pricing our products what products were offering procurement i mean jamie and kevin have been to the work stream so it was a combination of its just time and a fresh look gives you ideas that maybe you didnt recognize or at least raises the opportunity of that and weve been very pleased so far we just got a little more work to do kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and kevin let me add to that to kessels point we were not looking at our current efficiency ratio which you look at for at and thought that we were an outlier quite frankly i think we still show very well relative to our peers as it relates to efficiency ratio but to kessels point were on offence and were trying to grow the bank and we knew that if we needed to find capacity to continue to invest in new talent and technology that we had to be more efficient but in addition to the efficiency initiatives we have a lot of revenue initiatives were talking about and most importantly were also looking at process reengineering and automation thats going to not only make our team members lives better but also make us easier to do business with with our customers so for us were its not parochially focused on just efficiency were looking at growth were looking at generating revenue and were looking at becoming a better institution as we serve our customers and as kessel mentioned earlier were a great platform for teammates or for team members to come to today and we want to continue to get better there as well synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co okay great and one quick followup just on the margin on core excluding purchase accounting over the course of the year i know you mentioned what it would be roughly but when were looking in forward quarters would you expect it to see some more compression but then stabilization at some point midyear how should we expect it to flow andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah kevin you nailed it thats exactly what we would expect ill just say that fourth quarter looking at the core margin at we feel really good about that and it benefited from a couple things one is the investment portfolio repositioning and so thatll continue to benefit us and second is our thirdparty relationships as well as the renegotiation of those thatll also benefit us as we head into so we have that tailwind that got us to the but as we look at i would say that i would expect we guide for the full year slightly down i would just say expect most of that in the first quarter there are three things driving that one is we had just such strong loan growth in the fourth quarter the second thing is is that first quarter had a strong loan growth already quarter todate and the third thing is just that the fed move was at the end of october and so we didnt get a full quarter of that rate reduction and so i would say slightly down for the year biased towards the first quarter kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst d a davidson co great thanks guys

vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the expense topic again just given the initiatives and the longerterm expected benefits and everything where do you see the impact being to your efficiency ratio longerterm what do you think is the appropriate long term level for your efficiency ratio once you dial these efforts in thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp john yeah its a great question were striving for an efficiency ratio in the low i mean weve talked before about that in the area but we really shouldnt be low given the change in account of the underlying interest rate environment but look we think we can improve we think with our business mix we have opportunities to be better and be more efficient at how we go to market as kevin mentioned we think thats going to improve the experience for our associates and our customers and so were excited about that and we believe that these initiatives will help us get there john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it thanks and then separately on your guidance on the to asset growth how does that break down by the components in terms of loan growth securities and then maybe give us some color on the other side on deposits andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah yeah we as we look at were not really forecasting any material change in the investment portfolio you mentioned securities so if you look at our loan to deposit ratio were comfortable where we are with our liquidity profile and so i wouldnt expect that to change and just i mean so i would expect to see balanced growth from us on both loans and deposits john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it got it thanks and then lastly on the credit side the your delinquencies look like they jumped about linked quarter can you give us some color on what drove that and then separately do you have criticized and classified assets for the quarter and how that changed robert w derrick a executive vice president chief credit officer synovus financial corp yeah hey john this is bob ill try to provide you with a little color on that we did have one large ci credit that carried to quarter end its in our normal collection process so given the fact that as past due levels are so low when you have one it can move that needle up from a percentage standpoint as you called out from an ongoing basis we still see risk rate inflow risk rate new and renewed originations being at or better than our current levels we still got inflows that are minimal relatively speaking and our past dues while there will be some fluctuation obviously quartertoquarter when you get to these low levels theyre still showing no real signs of synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 overall credit deterioration your comment about the rated book john is youre going to have some credits move within substandard or special mention here and there throughout the quarter but again theres no real new names coming on to that list so its just normal course of business there kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp and john this is kevin ill just add to bobs comments as kessel mentioned we had roughly billion in production during the fourth quarter that was up over the third quarter and you heard bob mention the average risk weighting when we look at not only the book and you look at the low levels of npas and delinquencies that we have in our portfolio we have a keen eye on making sure that the new production thats coming on is consistent with that prudent growth strategy and to see that each quarter we have an improving risk profile as it relates to that weighted average risk rating gives us great confidence that we expect to see similar credit quality into the coming quarters and as bob mentioned youre going to have some episodic ebbs and flows in those numbers just because theyre so small but theres nothing that concerns us either from a portfolio or from what were seeing on the production side john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it and sorry did you imply that the would you state that the criticized or classified assets were stable in the quarter kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yes john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay got it all right thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from michael rose with raymond james michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey guys kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp hi michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc so it sounds like mid hey how are you sounds like midsingledigit loan growth is kind of what you guys are targeting you guys had really strong ci loan growth this quarter especially relative to the industry can you talk about just some of the growth drivers as we think about growth into is it are you guys moving upstream at all are the new hires that youve made which i think are more weighted towards wealth management in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 but is it some of the new hires is it market share takeaway just give us some color as to how we should think about growth next year thanks kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp no michael its a great question fourth quarter was a strong ci quarter but i look at the year and i look at almost million worth of ci growth and ironically it was not in the owneroccupied real estate category we see a tremendous amount of competition from some of our competitors that are offering longterm fixed rate owneroccupied mortgages and quite frankly based on our profitability requirements weve let some of that leave us so where were seeing growth on the ci front is really in our wholesale bank and we have added individuals there were up revenue producers in the wholesale bank this year the growth is coming from across our footprint in florida and alabama and georgia and south carolina i think as you recall we moved kevin howard to lead that group and its been a change that has continued to build momentum as the year has progressed and they put on a really strong fourth quarter and its not in any one industry its across many different industries were seeing it both on the line of credit side in unfunded commitments there was a growing at a commiserate rate but also on the funded debt thats coming on so were optimistic that that will continue not just from taking share from competitors but from the continued growth that we have from the bankers that kessel mentioned we brought on in the second half of the year and weve also brought on the structured lending division which is a new business for us thats all growth in the third and fourth quarter and were very optimistic that that will continue into and into the good news is when you look at what were doing were getting a tremendous amount of growth not only on the loan side but the really nice data point is that were getting treasury and operating accounts with a lot of those customers and weve talked a lot about our upgrade in treasury and payment solutions but when you look at the number of implementations that we had in versus we were up so that means were putting more solutions in the hands of our customers so were very optimistic to see that growth continue but were most excited about the new relationships that were able to garner michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay so that kind of dovetails with the comments around kind of balanced deposit growth as well it seems like youll be getting some traction on the dda side which you got this quarter but it seems like that will continue into next year correct kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah so average dda was up for the quarter when you look at number of accounts we grew on the consumer checking account front as well so that was exciting to see and were starting to get greater traction as it relates to operating accounts for some of these commercial relationships and thats going to be a big area of focus for us in to make sure that we get commercial deposit growth obviously thats a very sticky deposit and its one that comes on the lower end of the call spectrum as well so that will be something that were very focused on and were adding new treasury resources every day to make sure that we cover that market michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 all right very helpful maybe just one follow up question im going to go back to expenses can you just give a little bit more color on the third party that youve engaged maybe who it is and then that line item has been around million should we expect that to kind of grow as we move into next year as you kind of work through some of these efforts thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah this is jamie we have been working with boston consulting group and theyve been diving into many of our businesses and our products and youre right we will see expenses associated with this as we go through and we will be clear about the impact of those to nie as we go forward michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right thanks for taking my questions operator thank you and the next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks ill try not to ask another question about expenses im figuring you have enough grief about that for the rest of the day kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc but lets talk about the payback i guess from those expenses so like if we think about like i get that you hired a bunch of people and i see where youre growing assets this quarter or sorry in the to and you got to fee growth my question is like once those people and all these initiatives are done and up and running does that imply that asset growth should be higher than the to and fee growth should be higher than the to like not this year but into kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp yeah ill take that ken so its obviously each position that we hire we have a calculated roi npv and payback period so kessel mentioned earlier we know that our middle market bankers typically are less than eight months in terms of a payback and when you go to some of the wealth positions it takes a year or so for those earn backs but yes we look at those trailing revenue benefits and over time youll pick up some of the operating leverage for these new positions because the expense will stay flat and the revenue continues to grow so all else held constant on those positions yes the revenue increases while the expenses stay flat when you think about the guidance for next year and what we did this year we were up in fee income this year that was aided by our new hires if you look at some of those businesses that we added resources this year youll see another growth next year in those same businesses we just have some synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 anchors as it relate to fee income on a yearoveryear basis thats why you see a midsingle digit number for businesses like mortgage where seasonally it will be a little lower based on where we see interest rates capital markets where this year we had a record year so its hard to continue to grow that at but those businesses that weve invested in will continue to grow at a doubledigit pace and over time well become more efficient ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay that helps and then i guess the other question just in terms of provision expense i completely understand that cecl is going to drive greater volatility in your provision expense but you did mention it was going to be elevated is it right to think about if youre adding say basis points or about to your reserve ratio your allowance that your provision expense should also be call it roughly higher all things equal of course so instead of the million you did this quarter itll be something like million i mean is that the right logic to think about going forward andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp i think the right way to think about it going forward would be just to put an expansion of the allowance for credit losses to sit in your ending loan balance and too at the provision build would be required to get there on allowance build yeah its a little bit different answer than what youre saying ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc it is okay i guess ill have to think about that a little bit more but okay im good thank you very much kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks ken kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thanks ken operator thank you and now on the line we have brad milsaps with piper sandler brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 i just wanted to follow up on kens cecl question if my math is right it looks like you might be targeting a reserve around million by the end of the year if thats in fact correct does that also account for any payoffs you get on the acquired book some of that discount accreting back through the provision does that also take into account for that or is that pretty much where you think youll end up no matter what andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp we still feel confident that they wont impact the to and then we expect some slight expansion in the allowance over the course of the year as youre well aware the purchase accounting impact gets wrapped up into cecl in brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and then secondly just sticking with accretion income on the deposit side i think you had the million mark come through again this quarter my understanding is that obviously goes away this year how quickly do you think you can sort of earn that back so to speak through reductions in funding costs you had a nice reduction this quarter in interestbearing deposit costs of around basis points or so do you think it takes you a couple of quarters to sort of recapture that million so to speak or is it longer than that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ken youre right the benefit of paa on deposits goes away at year end and we expect some opportunity in deposit repricing in the first quarter and so we expect to see some decline there but the benefit of remixing is largely complete for us ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah operator thank you and the next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to first go back to your response to ebrahims question do you plan to manage fully your expenses to the revenue outcome and deliver positive operating leverage in on a fullyear basis andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp no we have revenue revenue headwinds include the paa impact that kevin mentioned million so we expect nii just to be marginally up on the year we have to and then we have strong growth in fee revenue and you see our guidance and so that does not lead to positive operating leverage for the full year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats clear thank you and then on the loan growth so when i look at florida community they were routinely doing million to million per quarter of growth before the sale and i think you said you did million loan growth in total from them in why did their loan growth fall by so much kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp its a great question steven so it was less about production when you go back and look at what they wouldve produced in and you compare it to their funded production in it was only off by a couple hundred million dollars so what we were pleased to see is that the level of production continued what changed was the level of payoffs and paydowns and it had very little to do with customer attrition it had to do with the maturation of their portfolio and the fact that they actually are seeing the type of churn that you would see in a portfolio as it matures as you recall they were producing somewhere around million to million worth of funding growth every quarter and they were growing million to million so there wasnt a lot of payoffs and pay downs as the maturity of their book has continued to increase theyre starting to see some of that churn so thats really the difference steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so youre saying the originations have remained consistent kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp very consistent and very strong and if you look at what they did in the fourth quarter it was a very high watermark for them it was a very very strong quarter for the legacy fcb team steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay thanks for all the color kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 yes operator thank you and next is jared shaw of wells fargo securities andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi jared kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi thanks just circling back on the provision i guess can you give a little color on what drove the im sorry the allowance build this quarter given the sort of backdrop of stable credit quality andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah weve spoken about this a little bit before but it really has to do with two things first is just loan growth in aggregate and second is the high level of paydowns kevin mentioned the strong production in the fourth quarter but we also still see elevated paydowns and when we have paydowns in the book in the fcb book we dont get the benefit of a provision release and so even though we had loan growth of million if you were to say what was the net loan growth of loans that we have provisioning yes itd be much higher however we did not have provisioning indiscernible and so thats what leads to that increase so basically we have normal loan growth and then we have the growth or the payoffs of ones where we did not have a provision against them and then the offsetting renewed and new loans jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful thanks and then just looking at the nii i heard i obviously hear your comments on the margin but when you look at nii and the strong momentum you said going into first quarter as well as the incremental benefit from that thirdparty servicing renegotiation should we expect to actually quarterly to see nii maybe stronger in first quarter and then trickling down or i guess how should we be looking at nii through the year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah let me just speak to it in rate terms we expect in the first quarter to see more of the impact of the more of a negative impact on loan yields and so well see were expecting a decline in of somewhere between and basis points in loan yields on the year but most of that will happen in the first quarter but decent percentage well have in the first quarter and again its that same impact that ive talked about about both the recent loan growth as well as the october rate move is a full quarter impact of that jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 okay thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks just a quick one on the fee income guidance for the year what does it take to get to the upper end of the range and are there scenarios that that could actually be greater kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so look for us some of it will do will have to do with the external market in terms of interest rates and what happens with the equity markets those are the variables that we look at weve obviously had a lot of resources on the fiduciary and brokerage side so as the market flows well be able to ebb and flow within that range also with mortgage if you look at most of our businesses as ive mentioned we expect to see strong growth in service charges yearoveryear based on our investments in treasury we expect to see doubledigit growth in our fiduciary business again the two businesses that represent a bit of a headwind for us as i mentioned were mortgage and capital markets for different reasons mortgage because of interest rates and capital markets just because of the elevated levels that we have this year so our success in moving to the high end of the range will have some of those external factors but quite frankly it will deal with our productivity internally and how we can continue to generate higher levels of production within those businesses christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it thanks very much kevin and thanks for all the discussion on the expenses this morning appreciate it kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp thanks chris kessel d stelling a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks chris operator thank you and next on the line is garrett holland with baird garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thanks and good morning just had a quick follow up for you i heard you on the efficiency ratio targeting low but could you provide some more detail on the updated topquartile profitability metrics youre targeting in this type of interest rate environment and whats a realistic timeframe for getting there andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 yeah we look at roa roatce efficiency ratio as we think about how do we perform versus peers and we believe in our strategies we believe in the work were doing this year on these transformation efforts to get back to the top quartile and so we think that we have a lot of momentum and a lot of opportunity here to improve that performance were not ready to give guidance on really our forecasts longerterm where we shake out on that but we will have more on that in the future kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp but garrett ill just in terms of timeframe we look at longterm targets as two to three years i think you go out past that its harder to forecast and to jamies point the variable there that has made the industry change their expectations is just what interest rates are going to do and its hard to forecast that out two to three years but our commitment is just to be in the high in the top quartile amongst our peer set garrett anthony holland q analyst robert w baird co inc thats helpful i appreciate the detail operator thank you and next we have steven duong with rbc capital steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just on you mentioned the competition in the owneroccupied portfolio was that the same tail on the multifamily side and what other segments are you seeing high level of competition kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp well look theres not a single asset class that we serve that doesnt have competition steven so its across the board now the owneroccupied there are a lot of smaller banks doing rate promotions where theyre offering longer tenor lower fixed rate loans and again within our business model were not going to chase business that doesnt make sense for us financially so were going to let some of that business leave us if that doesnt have the minimum profitability hurdle so i think thats what youre seeing in some of the owneroccupied side on the multifamily i think thats much more of just the stabilization of properties that are moving off balance sheet theres a higher level of construction there and so as those reach maturity and move to the permanent market theyre leaving our balance sheet but were still producing on multifamily and like all the other asset classes synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 24jan2020 were winning our fair share its just its going to ebb and flow based on some of the maturations that are in our book steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate the color on that and then just last one can you just remind us how much in your cd book youre expecting to have repriced for the quarter and whats the rate on that kevin blair a president chief operating officer synovus financial corp so right now we would look at the maturities in the first quarter of the year somewhere around million in cds the current portfolio is a little over if you go back and look at this quarter all of the maturities were at million and we repriced at million so i think based on a flat rate environment you would see a similar movement in the first quarter with the maturities being a little over and where were renewing and where were booking them in the high steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate it thank you operator thank you and that does conclude the questionandanswer session so i would like to return the floor to kessel stelling for any closing remarks kessel d stelling chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp all right well thank you operator and first thank you to all of you who participated on the call today we appreciate your interest in our company certainly some of the questions today might require a follow up and as usual our team is available throughout the day and certainly next
