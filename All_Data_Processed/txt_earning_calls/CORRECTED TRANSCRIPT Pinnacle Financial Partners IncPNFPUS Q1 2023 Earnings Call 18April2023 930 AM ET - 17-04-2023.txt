financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that im now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator good morning as youve seen first quarter was a very strong quarter for pnfp with outsized loan and deposit growth even in a difficult economic environment which i believe is linked to our client centric approach to the market much has been written and spoken i suppose within the last month or so about whether regional banks like ours could withstand the inevitable movement of deposits up to the money center banks so i believe we have now answered that question we have begun every call for years with this snapshot of our quarterly performance which is the fouryear quarterly format with intend to showcasing the longterm reliability of our performance on the metrics that we think matter through the cycle at the bottom of the slide you can see that asset quality continues to be extremely strong we have nonperforming assets classified assets and net chargeoffs continuing to operate well beneath the fouryear median which represents a period of exceptional asset quality its honestly hard to imagine how it could get any better than that pnfp has repeatedly been recognized by greenwich associates as having one of the best brands in the country according to greenwich pnfp stands out in the areas of being number one trustworthy and number two easy to do business with thats an incredibly powerful position to own in these turbulent times pnfp has the number one net promoter score and a footprint among businesses with annual revenues from million to million raving fans are always invaluable but never more than in times like these its just hard to leave a bank that you love and trust our ability to leverage the brand to attract the best and most experienced bankers away from our larger national and regional competitors in everincreasing numbers each of the last several years continues to contribute meaningfully to outsized growth the primary source of the growth is market share movement as these new recruits consolidate their loan and deposit volumes to pnfp decreasing our reliance on economic tailwinds it looks like to me that first quarter of was a dramatic demonstration of the power of a differentiated brand as evidenced by a annualized loan growth annualized deposit growth yearoveryear revenue growth yearoveryear net interest income growth so with that as an introduction let me turn it over to harold for a more indepth review of the quarter harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody ive got a few new slides this morning so ill move quickly through the usual slides to give time for the new information weve elected to start with deposits reporting linkedquarter growth of in the first quarter was a real positive for us obviously growing deposits at a reasonable price in is a key focus we continue to build out our depositgathering franchise around hsa community housing association nonprofits and others and we believe we are making headway with these and other special deposit initiatives our cumulative deposit base stands at pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 through march the last two rate hikes have seen more cost increases in relation to the earlier rate hikes we do have some confidence that our client base appreciate the fact that weve been fairly consistent in our approach to deposit cost increases while competitors are in some cases just now beginning to experience rapid increase in deposit costs this is one of our new slides its about addressing many of the hot topics that have come around as a result of the silicon valley and signature bank failures could not be more proud of our relationship managers our support units and how everyone answered the call when all of a sudden we were having to defend our franchise like never before we armed our people with timely and relevant information and they used that as well as years of relationship building to calm depositor base that was jolted by the failure of the two franchises as well as all the media attention that came with the failure of these two very unique franchises as to uninsured deposits the charts top left is our trend for uninsured and uncollateralized deposits for the last few years going back to precovid the important trend here is the drop of in the first quarter most of that is attributable to increased level of reciprocal deposits that we offer those depositors that request increased fdic coverage this is a product that weve offered for more than a decade our firm is focused on providing several alternatives to support depositors that may require additional support all in weve traditionally been about a median performer on uninsured depositors to our peer group and then hand in hand with our uninsured deposit position is our liquidity position we currently calculate that we have enough liquidity available to us to provide about coverage of our billion or approximately billion in uninsured deposits there is also much interest given the fdic insurance discussion about deposit account sizes were hovering around per deposit account for the last two years or so the table embedded in the chart breaks out commercial versus consumer sizes and trends below during covid commercial balances increased meaningfully likely due to ppp clients retaining more dollars indiscernible going forward as well as building cash balances due to fairly strong economic environment at least for our client base as to deposit mix shift in the bottom right chart were seeing depositors move more noninterestbearing and loweryielding interest accounts into higher interest rate products since the second quarter of last year were at around noninterest bearing to total deposits our financial plan contemplates further decreases through the rest of but no one really knows where itll end up we likely will be into the precovid levels below as noted on the chart before yearend right after the bank failures in midmarch we began tracking our largest uninsured depositors to determine how they manage their deposit balances going back to just prior to the silicon valley failure call it march the 10th through the end of last week those depositors comprised about billion in deposits indiscernible with the smallest deposit account being around million we began contacting relationship managers to find out what changes were happening during this critical time we identified transactions of about million with a brokerage account or a large cap bank under what appeared to be a flight to safety and something that was not anticipated prior to march as of the end of last week those same depositors had about billion in deposits which was up slightly from the billion that was there at march lastly weve been able to specifically identify about million in inbound deposits from silicon valley and signature bank obviously those are new accounts that were not in the top as of march given our strong first quarter results on deposits we believe our deposit base remains very resilient and our deposit growth guidance we offered last quarter remains intact at high single to low doubledigit growth for the year pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 the first quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us we are lowering our loan guidance for this year slightly to low to midteens growth from midteens growth as we noted in the release last night we tightened the credit box for construction and certain cre categories plus adding the incremental weakening of the macro environment we are opting for the lower loan growth guidance ph thats true were also reporting a average yield for the quarter and anticipate further increases as were expecting more announced rate increases and fixed rate loans are coming up for renewal with higher price targets so we should see fixed rates expand as well were again downsizing our net loan growth based on categories noted on the slide to help everyone better understand the source of our growth the chart is comparing all of to the first quarter of as many of you know our hire model requires significant experience greater than years in the market to come to work here just to reiterate substantially all of this loan growth is not a new borrower showing up at pinnacle bank with a new idea to pitch but borrowers that have extended relationships with our relationship managers over in many cases decades of working with each other this is just not true for charlotte nashville charleston and other legacy markets but that fact applies to atlanta dc and our special lending units as well as the top left chart reflects our gaap nim decreased basis points more than we anticipated at the start of the quarter out of an abundance of caution we added approximately billion cash to our balance sheet as a result of the recent bank failures thinking back we built liquidity in a similar way at the inception of covid but this trip weve tempered the absolute sizeable liquidity build as well as the maturity of the resulting federal home loan bank balances which comes with an average life of two years and a weighted average rate of about with the additional liquidity we have on our balance sheet our planning assumption that our nim will likely be down through the remainder of the year by call it basis points that said our growth model should provide for increases in net interest income as we entered we believe net interest income guidance of the midteens percentage growth for over is reasonable at this time as to credit were again presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well as noted earlier we continue to have a very limited appetite for new construction we adjusted the cre appetite chart on the bottom right somewhat so that only a limited number of cre types are now being considered by our credit officers additionally during the quarter our credit officers notified our lending units that any new cre loans that are ph particularly residing on a noted banks balance sheet will be more difficult to move to pnfp for the time being in summary our outlook for our loan portfolio from a credit perspective remains strong so if negative trends begin to develop we believe we remain advantaged my second new slide for the day is about credit the top left chart deals with trends in construction originations we began reducing our appetite for construction last summer which is consistent with the chart additionally the chart would also indicate that our appetite is largely concentrated in warehouse multifamily and some residential secondly much discussion about renewals of cre fixed rate loans which is the objective of the chart on the top right over the next several quarters we will have approximately million in fixed rate renewals and the average rate on these loans is currently around to our yield target at renewal will be in the 65plus range pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 two comments regarding this chart the absolute size of the fixed rate volumes coming up for renewal appears very manageable and that with property rental increases over the last three to five years and occupancy levels being stable we have great confidence that our borrowers will continue to be able to afford the incremental interest expense lots of noise around office cre right now and given what we hear about some markets rightfully so the bottom left shows about of our office portfolio is in our markets the chart also details where we are not located we like our markets and our borrowers that said our appetite for any new office is like zero the table on the bottom right details the granularity of the portfolio as well as select credit metrics our credit officers feel very strongly about the quality of our office portfolio that said they are aware of the macro case and our own point with these borrowers and lenders now on to fees and as always ill speak to bhg in a few minutes excluding bhg fee revenues were up more than million all that said were pleased with the effort of our feegenerating units as we saw somewhat of a rebound from mortgage a nice increase in service fees and wealth management we also have focused on increasing swap fees this year given recent hires so far so good we continue to anticipate that fee revenues excluding bhg and our other equity investments will come in at around a highsingle lowteens growth rate for over linked quarter expenses were up primarily due to increased head count merit raises at the beginning of january at a target of around beginning of calendar year adjustments for payroll taxes and indiscernible expenses increased fdic interest assessments and ph timing differential related credits and franchise taxes posted in the prior quarter additionally we have taken a hard look at our anticipated results for the year in comparison to our financial plan for and offsetting the increased linked quarter expenses we are reducing our anticipated incentive payouts to approximately of target awards in the first quarter to reduce incentive accrual speaks to the variable cost nature of our expense base along with deferring projects or slowing our hiring we feel like we have enough levers to throttle back on expenses should we need to overall we have a bold plan for this year and are fully energized to seize the opportunities we have in front of us that said we have modified our growth plans for this year and incorporated that into our updated outlook as it stands we have lowered our expense guidance and feel like our expense base should result in low to midteens growth for over as to capital tangible book value per common share increased to at quarter end up linkedquarter annualized on the last quarter our capital ratios remain above well capitalized we like our tangible common equity ratio which stands at we believe the actions weve taken to preserve tangible book value and our tangible capital ratio have served us well and have no plans currently to alter our tier capital stack via any sort of common or preferred offering couple of new things related to this slide the chart at the bottom of the slide tracks select capital ratios as of the end of december compared to peers given the impact of losses associated with the htm and aoci portfolios we are very pleased with the results given our capital appears to be able to withstand any sort of changes to the capital rules that may be coming our way from either the standard setters or the regulators now a few comments about bhg before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year as the slide indicates bhg had another great quarter in originations even though originations did decrease from the prior quarter with pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 bhgs implementation of a tighter credit mark so fewer of the lower credit score loans were funded in the first quarter bhg believes last years volumes reduction during would have been reduced by had the same credit standards been in place for all of last year versus credit standards that are in place now in all of that is related to the significant reduction in the lower tranche approvals which now are at approval rates spreads did expand in the first quarter from the fourth quarter for loans sold in the bank network first quarter spreads were compared to in the prior quarter thats coupled with larger allocations in the auction platform this quarter gain on sale revenue was up in the first quarter compared to the fourth so that math works the accrual for loan substitutions and prepayments increased as the more precautionary posture by the bhg management has been in effect for the last few quarters bhgs accrual for loan substitutions and prepayments for its sold loan portfolio increased from million to million call it the million increase as the blue bars in the bottom right chart show recourse losses were stable at basically consistent with last year this is a new slide focus on bhgs onbalance sheet lending strategy as you recall the gainonsale program is sourced through the bhgs bank network as depicted on the previous slide onbalance sheet strategy is a combination of several funding sources including securitizations negotiation for blocks of loans to individual banks and other funders et cetera the top left chart shows the loans bhg holds for investment versus held for sale to the community banks and thus offbalance sheet along with the associated allowance for loan losses given the macro environment and as we mentioned last quarter bhg increased its onbalance sheet reserve for loan losses to million or of its onbalance sheet loans from last quarter or about million increase of course cecl is still on the radar for adoption on october we continue to anticipate the estimated cecl reserve to be in the to range the bottom left chart shows loan yields for the last several quarters along with the average funding cost the yields consider average loan balances and include both hfi and hfs in the denominator the borrowing rates would include both borrowings collateralized by loans as well as the firms working lines of credit with the securitization completed in march the borrowing rates increased to while the loan yields were thus spreads were at around which is pretty strong in this environment as usual the bhg balance sheet and pl is included in the supplemental information the bottom right chart reflects net chargeoffs and as you can see first quarter shows increased chargeoffs at around lastly as mentioned bhg just successfully completed seventh securitization during the week right after the silicon valley and signature bank failures to get that accomplished at a reasonable rate was indeed a great success for bhg and reflects the significant appetite for their credits as mentioned earlier bhg tightened its credit box particularly with respect to lower tranches of its borrowing base this will have an impact on both production and spreads going forward bhg refreshes its credit score monthly always looking for indications of weakness in its borrowing base credit scores were up slightly from the previous quarter so the borrowers have remained resilient during the cycle thus far in comparison to other consumer lenders we believe bhg borrowers remain well compensated with average borrower earnings being around annually looking forward some key points id like to reemphasize and several of you have been talking about for the last three to four quarters first bhg indiscernible responded to the macro environment in a very real pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 way bhg is and will be increasing reserves based on macroeconomic data at least over the next few quarters secondly bhg has been modifying their credit models towards originating less risky assets production volumes were strong and we believe they have great momentum to maintain production levels equal to those in for bhgs new funding alternatives will broaden their already strong liquidity platform which we believe is unmatched by their peers currently bhg has billion in available liquidity to fund this franchise with more interested inbound calls coming lastly bhg took steps to limit its head count with job eliminations and eliminating most open positions as well as other expense reductions for this quarter were reducing our outlook for bhg from basically flat earnings growth this year to somewhere around million to million for the year we continue to have great confidence in our partners at bankers healthcare group to deliver strong results over the long term quickly again the usual slide detailing our current financial outlook for in the interest of time i wont go through all these again suffice to say theres a lot of macro issues swirling around right now we have put forth a business case on what we think the fed will do all right who knows whats going to happen we believe a recession is likely how deep or severe we or anyone else really knows what we do know is that our business model is resilient relationship based and in environments like we have today that matters a lot our management team is experienced and we have tackled economic downturns before we have great confidence that whatever curveballs get thrown at us we can handle it and perform in a very outsized way and with that ill turn it back over to terry m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you harold so i suppose its always true but it seems to me that i seem to notice that more in difficult economic environments that investors rightly look for the critical measure that will unlock significant value in the current environment it might be a deposit cost beta it might be the average deposit account size might even be the excess fdic deposit excess fdic coverage limit and any and all of that is informative to be sure but at pinnacle we will simply continue to rely on what we always have and thats a differentiated brand as evidenced by our unusual ability to turn clients into raving fans in our most recent data from greenwich we continued to have the highest net promoter score in our markets among businesses with sales from million to million im confident that has and should continue to enable us to retain and grow deposits even in a difficult economic environment fortune magazine just named us as the 24th best workplace in america and so we continue to be a magnet for talent we attracted another revenue producers during the first quarter of and we expect to be the employer of choice for those clientfocused bankers that are continually frustrated by their inability to get their top clients taken care of at many of our larger competitors i think that most people that understand our company they understand the linkage between the pace of our hiring and the pace of our loan growth its simply a matter of our associates consolidating their boat from where they were to us and because of their intimacy with the credits as harold alluded to earlier the asset quality continues to be strong for those credits that are being moved pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 similarly we leverage our brand and hire model along with extreme focus on execution to attract outsized core funding we fully expect the various specialty deposit initiatives that weve developed over the last several years like hsas like hoas and property managers like captive insurance companies just as examples to continue to support outsized deposit growth our capital levels compared to peers even after marking for heldtomaturity and aoci losses are very strong in relation to those peers and honestly i think that thats tied to an experienced management team thats largely been at the helm for years through all the ups and downs it was tempting for us just as it was tempting for others to deploy excess liquidity in the bond book but we just couldnt bring ourselves to load up on bonds when rates were at at or near alltime lows in our first decade we endured the dotcom bubble and still produced the second highest total shareholder return of all the publicly traded banks in the united states our second decade was in the aftermath of the great recession and included the pandemic again in the second decade we produced second highest total shareholder return of all the publicly traded banks in the united states and i obviously dont know what the future holds but i believe in that our differentiated brand and our intense focus on disciplined execution is likely to stand us in good stead in the third decade as well so operator well stop there and take questions question and answer section operator thank you mr turner everyone the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning terry good morning harold m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hello steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so i want to start first on the comment that you retained substantially all of your clients during this period im curious after the news of silicon valley bank and signature failing broke take us behind the scenes what were the conversations with your large depositors were they panic did you have to convince them to stay did they see pinnacle as being very different than those banks please provide some color with that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah steve thats a great question i think our normal set aside the crises our normal operating mechanism here is that every monday morning we are in touch with our entire sales force and so specifically what im saying there is rob mccabe runs a meeting for tennessee alabama and kentucky rick callicutt runs a meeting for north and south carolina and virginia and rob garcia runs a meeting for atlanta and so thats our normal mechanism to be in front of sales force and we talk to them about whatever the important initiatives are whatever the priorities are we give them all of the sales information we train relevant product knowledge all those kinds of things so on that monday following the silicon and signature failures we arm them with a variety of handouts one of which basically took key metrics from silicon signature and pinnacle and outlined things like whats the percentage of assets allocated to the securities whats the heldtomaturity loss whats the percentage of uninsured deposits and a series of those important measures that were intended to demonstrate the soundness of our balance sheet and pl versus those highlight the differences between our deposit book and theirs and so forth and so in addition to arming them with that kind of information they were also armed with sort of refreshers on fdic coverage and what can be done in the ordinary course accounts dialing all those kinds of things to maximize fdic covered and then also things like the reserve called deposit arrangements that harold alluded to in his comments and so anyway we armed them we encouraged them to be proactive to be in touch with large depositors and so forth up being the i dont think they talked very many people that had zero concern i dont think they talked very many people that were extremely panicked but clearly there was a concern but as you know information is a powerful thing and so i think we were successful in sort of allaying concerns that people might have and highlighting the difference between our franchise and the two failed banks am i hitting at what youre looking for steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah thats helpful actually so it sounds like you gave your frontline staff the information they needed to go out to your clients it doesnt sound like there was a panic from your clients to move to larger banks or money market funds or something like that and harold gave the number that of your largest clients you brought sounds like some deposits back so if things now stabilized terry is that how would you describe it m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i would i think i had a basketball coach that always said turner we dont hand out awards at halftime i dont think the contest is necessarily over but it does feel stable to me its less a topic of conversation i think if we are able to get to without further high profile bank failures and so forth my belief is it will stabilize steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and i had a question on the loan side so you guys dialed down the loan growth expectations for this year youre known for going against the grain im curious what are you seeing from peers are they tightening the credit box here too and why is this not an opportunity for you guys to use this as an pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 opportunity to take customers and share or is the environment just so uncertain that its time for you guys to be more cautious too m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc steve thats a great question i think in terms of credit tightening i would say its mixed out there i do think most people probably are leaning toward a more conservative stance as it relates to credit i dont think thats universal but i do think you would find it in large measure out there i think in our case its that appreciate the question because i think as it relates to the approach to the ci segment including owneroccupied real estate those doors are wide open we havent tightened there i think most of the tightening would center in the commercial real estate categories both construction and mortgage product and so i think thats really where the slowing is so to your question about isnt this a time to take share i believe it is the time to take share and i believe we will take share but that would be concentrated in the ci segment with a particular focus on small businesses and middle market companies steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful and if i could ask you one last one im curious big picture and actually id love to hear from both of you so as you guys watch what happened at silicon valley bank who basically lost or was in the process of losing of their deposits in two days right it illustrated the speed at which deposits can now leave the system when you look at that how does that change the way you think about risk liquidity positioning im just curious what are your key lessons that you learned from that and how do you change the way you run the bank now because of it thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah steve there is a lot in that question for sure i think bankers we tend to focus on the left side of balance sheet i think weve already focused back on the right side of the balance sheet our sales force instructions to the sales force for years was around deposit gathering we were now back at that and making sure that our deposit portfolio is as diverse as granular as our loan portfolio that we believe it is and so i think its gotten a lot of our relationship managers the people who interact with depositors on a daily basis back in the game with respect to how critical this deposit book is as to liquidity i think were likely to run elevated liquidity at least for the next several quarters as you might expect weve had several conversations with regulators theyre all routine in nature but theyre interested in what kind of things we may be looking at differently so with that ill stop and let terry kind of give you some comments but at the end of the day what i believe this bank is getting reenergized around is deposit gathering and if history proves whats going to happen in the future i think well be very successful in some of these new initiatives and how our people approach their client base m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 yeah steve i think what harold said is true i think ther will be an increased emphasis on diversification within the deposit book same it is the case for you for me the principal risk is related to deposit granularity had to do with their balances in excess of fdic coverage limit it sort of doesnt matter what other concentrations might underlie that just the fact that it was over the fdic limit is what created that flight to safety and so again i think youll see for us sort of increased emphasis on deposit granularity and ability to put our clients in a position where they feel safe and secure ill switch gears ill make two points number one i do mean what i said in our original presentation i think the power of having raving fans is incredible and again companies that fail had good fans too but they did not have net promoter scores like we do in that commercial segment and i think that as i said its very hard to leave a bank that you love and trust and so well continue to pound away on that i know its lost on a lot of people who have a preference for financial analyses but at the core i do think that was the principal mechanism that enabled us to keep our clients and keep them calm and so forth along those lines one last thing different than some of the financial things that harold mentioned i think youll see an increased emphasis on our crisis communication plans again i think were great internal communicators i think we did extremely well following those bank failures but i do think that will and try to enhance crisis communication mechanisms because to your point man things move fast and you better have an ability to get your people armed with what they need when that comes up and so i think well do more work around crisis communications steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc perfect thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah operator thank you your next question is coming from jared shaw from wells fargo securities your line is live jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 hey maybe just shifting a little to the bhg side and good color there i guess when you look at the bhg charge off descriptions whats the difference or why is the onbalance sheet chargeoff level so much higher than the losses on the sold loans harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont really have a good answer for you there its a great question they did not or have not they dont go through any kind of special process to say were going to keep these loans versus sell these loans its more of a kind of a haphazard kind of process they go through to figure out which bucket the loan goes into i would imagine that some of the newer credits call it the and vintages may be more prevalent on the onbalance sheet side than some of the loans that have been aged longer with the gain on sale platform could have something to do with jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay and then if we look at that pullback that youre referencing compared to last years origination is that a should we be thinking about that being higher risk over the next months or so just given the lower credit standards compared to what youre putting on now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think they believe theyre going to have call it elevated chargeoffs from those ef charges probably through the next couple of quarters when they believe that most of them will have seasoned enough and i think theyve been anywhere from to months is the appropriate seasoning for those particular credits thats a the proverbial credit losses will get through the snake so thats what they believe in a way jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just a final one on bhg when we look at that slide and look at the expectation for pretax earnings does that include the impact of cecl in october or would that be in addition to that or separate from that through equity harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well that would include the pl impact of cecl for the last three months of the year for sure jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay okay great thanks very much thats my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jared operator thank you your next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning one followup on bhg was it seems that throughout the quarter there was still a lot of appetite for banks on the auction platform for to buy bhgs paper have you seen any change in that in the back half of the quarter or maybe in april so far and what is the risk that in an environment where youre seeing banks reduce loan demand across the board that they become less inclined by bhg paper thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah catherine bhg their management was concerned about that in the earlier part of the quarter but every day they opened up the auction platform the banks came and so thats true through today they dont have any reason to believe right now that they wont see kind of a similar placement number in the second quarter and i think that here for the rest of the year they ought to have a fairly consistent growth curve here for the remaining three quarters of this year which theyll only be able to achieve with the gainonsale auction platform so i think theyve got great confidence that the banks will continue to show up here over the next several quarters m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi catherine i might just comment quickly in simple terms first quarter was a record quarter for bhg in terms of placements and march was the highest month in the quarter in terms of placements so it exceeded february on the heels of the bank failures and so forth so again thats a pretty good testament as harold said here in the early part of april it appears to be functioning exactly as it always has catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats really encouraging thanks for that and then maybe switching over to credit just i saw your outlook that calls for the acl to be flat in the second quarter over the third and kind of just remains as strong for you just curious what it takes from a macro perspective or what youre looking at maybe at your borrowers that could and maybe if your loss potential doesnt change dramatically but just from a macro perspective what might make you decide you need to build that reserve a little bit more than what youve got and im particularly curious about the cre reserve which is basis points still below but i know that includes a lot of different type of cre projects in there so just kind of curious what youre how you think about how comfortable you are with that acl and the outlook for that over time thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah sure well were going to were obviously going to run our credit models around unemployment and gdp drop kind of the what may be the change agent for what the reserve could do over the next several quarters we do have the ability to overlay to add qualitative assessments in there and we have done that if we were to follow just the strict nature of the quantitative reserve it would be meaningfully lower pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 so we are call it adding incremental reserves as a result of the environment and kind of the uncertainty around it but as long as our conversations with our credit officers continue to reflect a pretty benign credit environment we think where we are is pretty good so we dont anticipate a big uptick in the reserve here in the second quarter who knows whats going to happen in the third or fourth but as it sits today our credits are performing like we would expect them to do catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats all ive got ill step out of queue thank you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator thank you your next question is coming from casey haire from jefferies your line is live casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning guys i wanted to follow up on the nim forecast just to clarify that harold i think you said down bps so we end the year at and then what kind of fed forecast are you guys contemplating in the release you guys talk about potential fed cuts or the slide deck rather harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were ph at quarter i think by the end of june and then getting down maybe one or two cuts in the last half of the year which are pretty inconsequential to our forecast but that would be where we what we think our case is for what the fed could do who knows what theyre going to do but as it sits right now not really sure thats going to have a significant impact on our call it our nim or noninterest income once we get past call it august or september did i get your question okay casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thats great and so the down bps so by you expect to run around harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats what our planning assumption is is in that kind of a modest decrease in nim casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay great and what kind of deposit beta are you like where do we go from the harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 well we think our deposit well if you assume that the rateup environment is going to end by the end of june were probably closer to to casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just one more followup on bhg so if i take the midpoint of the guide it looks like in the remaining quarters you guys are expecting a little bit of an uptick from the million run rate in the first quarter and just looking at the slides just whats driving that improvement is it the cost measures because it feels like you guys are building more reserves and the funding costs are pressuring just some color on whats driving that ph improvement harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah casey i think your first assertion is right they do believe theyre going to see upticks here for the rest of the year that could be because i think the reserve build in the first quarter was more significant than they think what its going to be in the next few quarters so it could be partially that but right now their production seems to be hanging in there they still believe theyre going to be near what the production levels were last year so then theyll have the kind of the ability and the decision to send the loans to the auction platform or keep them on balance sheet theyve got some obligations here in the second quarter to fund more on balance sheet with some of the call it the private equity funding sources but they think theyve got to be able that they will do and still be able to send loans to the auction platform to kind of get their bottom line number moving more that was a lot of indiscernible and did i get through it okay casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah yeah i know thats great thanks last one for me just on the expense side of things in the release you guys mention potentially pursuing cost measures given a tougher revenue outlook just what would prompt you guys to explore that further and is there like a profitability or efficiency ratio in mind that you guys would look to protect harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think we have any kind of hard goals on efficiency ratios but what we want to make sure everybody understands is that we do have a meaningful variable cost component in our plan and a lot of that evolves around our incentive accruals and nobody wants to see us hit that but in the past we have always when weve had more difficult call it earnings growth years to go at that incentive accrual and use it to help insulate our results weve also got the ability to back off on hiring if we need to do that weve got several projects that are slated for the rest of the year now and the projects probably wont result in a significant kind of cost savings measure for but they could for next year so weve got several options that we could go into if we needed to to help protect what we believe is a reasonable result this year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thank you pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 operator thank you your next question is coming from brandon king from truist securities your line is live brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so i understand the decision hey hey so i understand the decision to have a more conservative liquidity position going forward but i wanted to know what you would need to see for that to change and to feel more comfortable deploying or paying down some borrowings harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think it well see some of these federal bank borrowings and theyve got an average life of two years and a lot of them have lots of call it one to six months right now we dont intend to renew those so well let our on balance sheet cash probably drift down some when you look at our onbalance sheet cash compared to peers were probably little lighter than say some of our peers so well probably be looking at more of a median performer on that so that could have that could find its way to our call it our second quarter or third quarter liquidity position brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then also wanted to get more color on the fixed rate loan repricing and wanted to get a sense of what those conversations are with customers and how are they navigating this environment and it seems like some customers may be preferring more variable rate loans nowadays and i noticed that your swap fee income has increased so just some color on that and kind of what that means potentially for the balance sheet as far as variable rate loans versus fixed rate loans and indiscernible the balance sheet going forward harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think well see a dramatic change in the composition of our balance sheet as far as the allocation of fixed rate credit with the rateup cycle weve had a lot more requests for fixed rate lending hopefully well not hopefully but we counter that with an active swap program because we believe that there comes a point where youve just got to put up barriers around how much fixed rate lending product you want to allocate to the balance pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 sheet and so were about trying to create more of a variable rate loan portfolio currently yeah ill stop there brandon and see if ive got your question brandon king q analyst truist securities inc yeah yeah and kind of what im getting at is that we could get potential indiscernible this year and next year so just wanted to get a sense of how you plan on kind of protecting the net interest margin in that environment harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah weve got some floors that weve entered into over the last several months that will help protect it but i think going back to the last downrate cycle we were pretty aggressive on reducing deposit rates i think that makes sense in light of how aggressive weve been on raising deposit rates so we will lean into our relationships and make sure that whatever pricing we provide depositors is fair and reasonable but we wont be hesitant to reduce deposit rates when we need to brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay that answered my questions thank you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brandon operator thank you your next question is coming from michael rose from raymond james your line is live michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey guys just a few most of my questions have been asked and answered just a few more harold if you could just give some color on the nonbhg fee guide and kind of what you would expect kind of by business unit obviously the growth guide is pretty solid but just wanted to get some color on the components thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think at the end of the day michael thats a great question but at the end of the day it has to do with some hiring weve done over the last call it two to three quarters and our expectations that those revenue predictions are going to show up primarily in wealth management and capital markets and capital markets we include the swap programs among others so we expect them to show up with a nice lift in our revenues for mortgage last year was down pretty significantly we like our markets we like the pipelines that theyre looking at currently and so we expect mortgage to be much more impactful in or positively impactful in than what happened in so just off the cuff id say those are the call it the three or four areas that were expecting big things from pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great and then maybe just moving back to deposits appreciate the color on the different initiatives can you just kind of stratify how much they kind of contributed to this quarters growth and what we should expect from contribution point of view for the various initiatives laid out as we kind of move through the back half of the year just trying to size the impact thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i want to say the specialty initiatives have grown and i saw indiscernible of about million in deposits since id call it the end of last year or the fourth quarter of last year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay helpful and then maybe just one final one for me just going back to an earlier question around you guys being opportunistic i mean your efficiency ratio is in the low pretty good profitability here even despite some bhg kind of headwinds i mean why not ramp up the hiring efforts i would think that kind of across the industry as loan growth slows theres going to be a lot of kind of idle lenders sitting around and you guys have built out some markets opportunistically over the years most recently dc terry if you can just give us kind of your holistic thoughts and i know youve talked about some other markets in the past i want to put the cart before the horse but anything kind of moved more to focus just given whats going on industrywide thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thanks for the question michael i think in the case of hiring i think we are moving forward at a pretty decent pace there is ive mentioned i think revenue producers in the first quarter that gets you north of revenue producers hired for the year i think last year was a record at something near but north of would be one of our higher years for revenueproducing hires so i think you can see that were intending to continue the share play of hiring great people having them move the indiscernible business to us i think as it relates to market extensions what weve said really is we want to be in all large highgrowth urban markets in the southeast and so the principal voids i think for us are primarily in florida and particularly the markets like tampa orlando and jacksonville would be particularly attractive to us and so the catalyst to go there is just really about the availability of people and when i say that im not speaking of the availability to hire some revenue producers thats easy but what we need before we go is to believe we can hire somebody who can hire a lot of people across multiple disciplines including the wealth management businesses and so forth and so i think youre on the right track i think the likelihood that some of those people are frustrated and want to have a different opportunity is high if we find those people we would go and i think youve heard me say it before michael that id go this afternoon if i had them ill go next week or next year or whatever we believe were going to produce dramatic growth without doing it but if we believe weve got an opportunity to go to one of those large highgrowth markets in the southeast well definitely try to seize it pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc great guys thanks for taking my question operator thank you your next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys appreciate it do you guys have any data on kind of what youre seeing currently on the marginal cost of deposits im not sure if i missed it any commentary there but in terms of new addon cds other new pricing indiscernible harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well our average deposit costs were up call it basis points i think our incremental accounts are coming in call it in the mid somewhere like that for call it negotiated rates stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay got it and on the bhg average income you guys give i know i havent looked at how far back youve given them i know its and i think thats what it was last quarter has that migrated significantly over time to your knowledge or has that always kind of been in that range as theyve been originating this portfolio m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc stephen i cant recite the numbers but i dont think its a significant migration it obviously moves some but i dont think its had meaningful movement and its always been a high disposable income segment that they ph loan to stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah makes sense and then just last thing for me kind of a lot of color you guys gave on the office portfolio and appreciate that do you have data im not sure if i missed it on a like segmentation between class a b c harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont have it with me but substantially all of our office would be a and into b most of it is suburban although weve got some of the larger projects are more call it near city center some projects stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it okay perfect well everything else i had was asked and answered so thanks for the time harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 all right thanks stephen operator thank you your next question is coming from brett rabatin from hovde group your line is live brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning just two quick ones first on the expense guidance as you guys approach billion is there any cushion that youre putting in there related to approaching that number or have you had any conversations around what might be entailed with potential changes and regulatory oversight for that number harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brett thats a great question weve not call it been investing in areas to accomplish a billion kind of regulatory threshold what we have been doing is traditionally the regulators will always even though billion might be a bright line in some respects and right now we dont know of any changes at that level but if history proves itself again they will begin coaching us immediately and well have call it whatever time period call it two to three years to kind of get prepared so that when we get the start market billion there there were in good shape but today as far as our stress testing our crisis management we feel like were in great shape with respect to our call it regulatory compliance brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay helpful and then and i joined late so you may have talked about this but on the wealth management side i know youve hired some productive or bigger teams on that platform here in the recent quarter or two have those teams moved over the bulk of their relationships or is that still a process that could lead to higher income related to that particular line m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc that would still be a meaningful part of the income growth that we would anticipate the length of time for a lot of the wealth managers i particularly talk about the brokers and trust administrators i think in the case of the brokers is generally a shorter cycle than say a commercial relationship manager which would take about four years to consolidate their book its a little bit shorter for the brokers probably similar for the trust administrators but yeah we still have hired a bunch of people who are still in early stages of consolidating their clients from where they were to us brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay so terry that number in terms of the fee income related to that that could continue to have sizeable increases in the next few quarters you think based on the recent hires m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i do pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great appreciate the color m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brett operator thank you your next question is coming from brody preston from ubs your line is live brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning everyone thanks for allowing me to hop in the queue i just have a couple of questions harold one of them was a clarification on the bhg financials can you clarify for me if the provisioning that bhg does every quarter is that just related to the onbalance sheet loans that they have or is that related to any like first loss kind of position that they have from the loans they sell as well harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no its all related to the loans that are on their balance sheet brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay i ask just because when you kind of back into if you use the indiscernible disclosure and the provision disclosure you can kind of back into the chargeoffs and the chargeoffs the last couple of quarters at least from an annualized rate perspective are kind of in the midteens levels and over the last four quarters theyve averaged about and so one of the twopart question on that is whats kind of causing the elevated chargeoff rate in a relatively strong economic environment and secondly if of the average chargeoff rate over the last four quarters why is an to kind of reserve ratio make sense just given how the cecl accounting typically works harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont know i dont compute the but there are elevated chargeoffs or those ef charges from and that are coming for this year thats why they believe that over the next couple of quarters we should see some relief from those chargeoffs brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you operator thank you your next question is coming from brian martin from janney your line is live brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 hey good morning guys thanks for let me jump in here just two things for me harold just to clarify your outlook or just kind of margin conversation the basis points does that include the reduction or kind of how are you thinking about that the liquidity you put on i mean the timing does that contemplate your full reduction in that liquidity or i know you said youre going to keep it on for a bit so just trying to understand that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah as far as where we are today we think about half of that will be gone by the end of the year brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay half will be gone so the half thats in this the kind of the guide this year and then theres more that come next year and then just kind of the end of period kind of march margin inclusive of that liquidity can you give a little bit of thought on where we ended march versus the quarter on the margin harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc oh the march margin was around i think or something like that brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay so a little bit below it okay and then just i think you talked about maybe im if i heard it right that the continued migration on the deposit side maybe being the noninterest bearing maybe being below by the end of the year just kind of in that context just the specialty deposits that the initiatives you guys have in place a is that what you said or this is accurate just if i heard it right and then just as far as how much contribution you expect in from these specialty initiatives relative to kind of if youre looking at deposit growth how much of the specialty the new initiatives kind of contribute to that this year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think that the target that weve handed the call it the leadership around those the path or around those special initiatives is somewhere around call it billion in growth this year so were hoping that where they are thus far that theyll be able to get to that number as brian did that get to your question brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah yeah i think the only thing you can clarify in that number harold if that pda is kind of where you think youre trending toward by yearend harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah who knows where were going to end up but thats the planning assumption that were building or that were using brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 okay got you okay and then just the last one harold just on the back to the margin for just a moment the outlook if you do see rate cuts later in the year it sounds like you have some floors in place so i mean probably not much of a change or just how does the margin outlook with potential rate cuts and i guess thats what it sounds like you have kind of in the in kind of your planning assumption at the moment harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yes yeah we do brian joseph martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay i think im good thanks for taking the questions harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc
