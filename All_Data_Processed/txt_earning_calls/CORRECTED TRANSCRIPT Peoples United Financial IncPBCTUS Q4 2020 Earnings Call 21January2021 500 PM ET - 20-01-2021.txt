good afternoon we appreciate everyone joining us today i hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy lets begin by turning to the fullyear overview on slide we are pleased with our performance in especially in light of the uncertain economic environment caused by the pandemic full year financial and operating results were strong and reflect the resilience of peoples united its employees and customers net income of million increased from a year ago and on a per common share basis net income was up to operating earnings of million or per common share declined and respectively its important to note we completed the sale of the peoples united insurance agency in november and realized a pretax gain net of expenses of million which is not included in operating earnings preprovision net revenue of million increased million or from a year ago reflecting the success of recent acquisitions and solid execution across core operations total operating revenues of nearly billion increased driven by higher net interest income partially offset by modestly lower fee revenues operating expenses of billion which includes a full year of united and belmonts results were up notably operating expenses ended the year below the level the lower end of the outlook range we provided a year ago of billion the increase in revenues along with our continued emphasis on controlling expenses and realizing projected cost savings from acquisitions lowered the fullyear efficiency ratio basis points to marking the seventh consecutive year of improvement turning to the balance sheet periodend loans and deposits increased to and respectively from year end excluding ppp the loan portfolio decreased approximately billion or driven by lower retail balances of approximately billion modestly offset by commercial loan growth of million the decline in retail balances was mostly due to our planned reduction of residential mortgages as we remixed the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios the impact of the pandemic on the economy was evident in the commercial portfolio throughout the year demand within the commercial real estate and ci middle market businesses was limited due to reduced economic activity and funding provided by ppp loans conversely our mortgage warehouse and lease businesses experienced strong growth mortgage warehouse ended with a record balances of billion which more than doubled from while lease periodend balances increased from the prior year the lease which we acquired in has been a terrific addition to peoples united franchise weve had successfully leveraged the liquidity and funding provided by the bank and other synergies to achieve significant growth while maintaining both excellent asset quality and high yields lease balances ended at nearly billion up from approximately million at the time of the acquisition asset quality remained excellent as net chargeoffs to average total loans were basis points for the full year these results are indicative of the companys conservative approach to underwriting diversified loan portfolio and deep customer relationships we are particularly pleased by the continued reduction in loan deferrals which ended the year at million or of total loans down from billion or of total loans at the close of the third quarter additionally deferrals have continued to decline since yearend as of january total deferrals were down to million or less than of total loans we remain committed to supporting our high quality customer base and help them navigate these difficult economic times consistent with our intentions discussed last quarter we provided postsecond deferral modifications to customers in need of further assistance approximately billion in peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 loans received modifications the majority of the modifications are in commercial real estate with the largest concentration within the hospitality sector as expected moving on to slide as consumer preferences evolve to more digitallydriven experiences we have continually enhanced our technology capabilities to deliver value provide convenience and create efficiencies as a result customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms for their banking needs given these accelerating digital banking trends and shifts in retail shopping behaviors we announced today the decision not to renew our existing instore branch contracts with stop shop in connecticut and new york upon expiration we operate stop shop branches in connecticut and in new york our contract in connecticut expires at the end of january while the new york contract goes to midyear currently discussions with stop shop on renewal terms are ongoing although our stop shop relationship has provided meaningful value to the bank and its customers over more than two decades this decision provides us the opportunity to further optimize our branch network while providing the same level of personalized service across each of our channels in addition cost savings achieved over time by not renewing these contracts will enable further investment in our digital capabilities and traditional branch network we remain committed to serving customers in the manner in which they want to interact with us whether it be in person at a branch virtually through our online and mobile platforms or a combination of both we are confident customer and deposit retention will be very strong due to the customer portfolio profile of our stop shop branches increasing adoption of digital platforms expanded traditional branch footprint proximity between in store and traditional locations and trends in retail shopping behavior while instore branches comprise approximately half of our total branches in connecticut and new york only of the customers and of the deposit balances are domiciled in these locations in addition the instore customers carry balances that are only of traditional branch customers furthermore only of our branch deposit balances in these two states are associated with customers that actually visited an instore branch in as previously mentioned customers are increasingly utilizing our online and mobile platforms digital engagement has increased significantly yearoveryear for example mobile logons are up digital enrollments have increased mobile wallet transactions are up and we have experienced a increase in active mobile deposit customers notably our instore customers are more digitally active than those at traditional branches and only of deposit balances are associated with customers that used stop shop branches in but did not utilize a digital channel importantly the strength of our hubandspoke branch model we built over time created a high level of overlap between our instore and traditional branches as such of our stop shop branches and of our stop shop branch deposits are domiciled within five miles of one of our traditional locations in addition recent bank acquisitions of suffolk in new york farmington ph and united in connecticut have expanded and better optimized our traditional branch footprint in these states as well as provided customers a greater number of convenient driveup facilities finally changing trends in retail shopping behavior has become apparent the availability of delivery and curbside pickup options which have become more prominent during the pandemic have impacted foot traffic peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 inside stores additionally discount stores and wholesale clubs and convenience stores have increased their share of grocery spend while share of the traditional grocery stores has declined with that here is david to discuss the fourth quarter results r david rosato senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you jack i will begin on slide with an overview of the fourth quarter we concluded the year with a solid financial performance in the fourth quarter operating earnings of million increased linked quarter on a per common share basis operating earnings were up provision for credit losses on loans decreased for the second consecutive quarter to million and further strengthened the allowance for credit losses to total loans by basis points to basis points or basis points excluding ppp loans operating preprovision net revenue of million declined from the third quarter due to modestly lower net interest income partially offset by slightly higher fee income and lower expenses finally it is important to note the effective tax rate in the fourth quarter reflected a million benefit related to the revaluation of certain state deferred tax assets moving to slide net interest income of million decreased million or from the third quarter the decline was driven by the loan portfolio which unfavorably impacted net interest income by million this headwind was partially offset by lower deposit costs which benefited net interest income by million lower borrowings and higher balances in the securities portfolio also collectively benefited net interest income by notably during we have reduced borrowings by over billion on a periodend basis as a result of billion of deposit growth since the beginning of the year net interest income included million from ppp during the quarter which consists of million in fees and million in net interest income these results reflect million related to loans forgiven in the quarter as displayed on slide net interest margin of was basis points lower than the third quarter primarily due to increased excess liquidity which unfavorably impacted the margin by basis points lower yields in the loan and securities portfolios also unfavorably impacted the margin by basis points and basis points respectively in the loan portfolio new business yields remained lower than the total portfolio yield however new business yields and credit spreads modestly improved in the quarter the largest offset to these negative effects was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing which benefited the margin by basis points average deposit costs were basis points in the fourth quarter compared to basis points in the third quarter marking the sixth consecutive quarter of lower deposit costs finally ppp had a basis point favorable impact on net interest margin for the quarter turning to loans on slide average balances were down million or from the third quarter while period end loans decreased approximately billion or the loan portfolio continues to be impacted by reduced retail balances and a low demand for our commercial real estate and middle market ci businesses due to limited economic activity on a period end basis retail loans decreased million mostly attributable to our planned reduction in residential mortgages which lowered balances by million from the close of the third quarter peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 commercial loans were down million which included a million decline in ppp balances due to forgiveness and a combined million reduction in our runoff portfolios conversely loans benefited from record mortgage warehouse balances and strong growth by leaf mortgage warehouse period end balances closed the quarter at billion up million from september as results continue to be driven by robust mortgage origination activity and the addition of new customer relationships lease average and period end balances grew and respectively from the third quarter balances in the transactional portion of the new york multifamily portfolio which is in runoff mode ended the quarter at million down million linkedquarter and million for the year in addition the periodend balance for the united loans we have chosen to run off was million a decline of million from september and million since yearend moving to deposits on slide average balances were up billion or from the third quarter while period end balances grew billion or the growth which helped to lower the loantodeposit ratio to was broadbased as balances increased across our retail commercial and municipal businesses both average and periodend balances were up across all categories with the exception of time deposits as higher cost cds rolled off average time balances decreased million linkedquarter while on a periodend basis balances were down million the decrease in time deposits is a reflection of customer preference for liquidity during this uncertain economic and low interest rate environment importantly periodend noninterestbearing deposits increased for the seventh consecutive quarter balances of billion were up billion from the end of the third quarter and billion for the year noninterest bearing deposits now account for more than of total periodend balances up from a year ago turning to slide 9noninterest income of million increased million or linked quarter as referenced earlier we completed the sale of peoples united insurance agency realizing a million gain excluding this gain operating noninterest income of million grew million or from the third quarter this increase was driven by commercial bank lending fees which were up million primarily driven by higher ph pre loan prepayment fees an increase in customer interest rate swap income of million and higher operating lease income and cash management fees which collectively benefited noninterest income by in addition other noninterest income was up million primarily due to the marktomarket of one equity security position the largest offset to these increases was a million reduction in insurance revenues due to the sale of puia in early november on slide noninterest expense of million decreased linked quarter the fourth quarter included million of nonoperating costs an increase of compared to the third quarter and they were in the following categories million in other noninterest expense in professional and outside services and in equipment in occupancy and equipment excluding nonoperating costs noninterest expense of million decreased compared to the previous quarter noninterest expense benefited from lower regulatory assessment and operating lease expense which were down million and respectively from the third quarter conversely noninterest expense was unfavorably impacted by higher costs in occupancy and equipment of million due to seasonality in professional and outside services of million related to the timing of projects briefly on slide the efficiency ratio of increased basis points linked quarter primarily due to modestly lower revenues as i stated last quarter we will remain very diligent in our management of expenses peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 and continue to be focused on enhancing operating leverage as we move forward in this current low interest rate environment as jack mentioned earlier our asset quality remains excellent as displayed on slide net loan chargeoffs to average total loans of basis points improved basis points linked quarter nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans at reo of basis points was basis points higher compared to the third quarter this increase was attributable to our motor coach portfolio in the peoples capital and leasing business within equipment finance the motor coach segment has been significantly impacted by the pandemic primarily due to the decline in tourism looking at slide it is evident the gain related to the puia sale had a significant favorable impact on fourth quarter returns however on an operating basis returns were generally consistent with the third quarter operating return on average assets of basis points increased basis point while operating return on average tangible equity of was down slightly from finally on slide capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management it is again important to note adjusting for ppp loans the pro forma tier leverage ratio at quarter end is for the holding company compared to and for the bank compared to additionally the tce ratio excluding ppp is approximately compared to the reported before turning the call over to jack to go over our outlook i wanted to mention that we are still in the process of performing our annual goodwill impairment assessment additional time is necessary to complete the analysis given the complexities brought about by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic particularly the current and projected low interest rate environment and the decline in bank stock valuations last fall including on the companys annual assessment date of october any potential goodwill impairment charge could be material to reported earnings but would represent a noncash charge and have no effect on cash balances liquidity or tangible equity in addition because goodwill and other intangible assets are not included in the calculation of regulatory capital our wellcapitalized regulatory capital ratios would not be affected by this potential noncash expense the analysis will be completed prior to the filing of our annual report on form 10k with the sec with that id like to turn it over to jack john p barnes chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you david looking forward we are cautiously optimistic about the economy as society continues to adjust to the pandemic in particular we are pleased banking activity trends continue to improve despite ongoing social distancing protocols we are also hopeful the vaccines will help restore a bit of normalcy and potentially help to accelerate economic improvement in the latter half of the year however a lot of uncertainty remains while we enter in a position of strength the recent surge in the virus nationwide and a prolonged low interest rate environment present a challenging backdrop for loan growth net interest income and margin despite these headwinds we are very confident in the resilience of our franchise to maintain strong execution across our operations further invest in digital capabilities and deliver exceptional service to customers with that backdrop in mind let me outline our full year outlook for as listed on slide it is important to note our announcement today on the decision not to renew our existing instore branch contracts with stop shop will not have an impact on financial results peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 we expect to grow loans excluding ppp balances in the range of to on periodend basis ppp balances totaling billion at yearend our current expectation is that these loans will be forgiven in the first half of secondly we anticipated periodend deposit balances to change in the range of down to up this expectation is reflective of the significant deposit growth in and uncertainty of additional government stimulus measures we expect net interest income to decrease in the range of to embedded in this outlook is the expectation for net interest margin to be in the range of to this net interest margin range is derived from many different factors one of which is an assumption of no change in the fed funds rate during the year operating noninterest income is expected to grow in the range of to from an adjusted operating base of million which excludes million of noninterest income from the puia and a million gain on the sale of loans acquired in the united transactions operating noninterest expense which excludes merger related cost is anticipated to be in the range of billion to billion as compared to billion in which excludes million of peoples united insurance expense this expense outlook reflects our continued commitment to invest in digital capabilities to further enhance efficiencies and convenience of customers we also expect to maintain excellent credit quality with a provision in the range of million to million the wider range compared to prior year outlook is indicative of continued uncertainty caused by the pandemic in addition we anticipate our effective tax rate for the year to be in the range of to finally we plan to maintain strong capital levels with an expectation that at yearend holding company common equity tier capital ratio will be in the range of to that concludes our prepared remarks well be happy to answer any questions that you may have operator can you please proceed to the qa portion of the call peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen we are ready to open the lines up for your questions operator instructions please stand by for your first question your first question comes from casey haire with jefferies your line is now open q hey good evening everyone this is indiscernible for casey john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hey indiscernible q just following up on the stop shop commentary i understand its a event maybe could you help us think about some of the financial impacts like deposit attrition maybe fees and expenses granted i think you mentioned earlier that there will be expense kind of reallocated in some of the investment side but just trying to get a feel for how can shake out thanks r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure thank you for recognizing this is a big strategic decision for us but it really doesnt have much of an impact in or it doesnt have an impact in when we look out the total cost to run the combined states stop shop including grant comp and equipment etcetera is a number in the million to million range so theres a large opportunity for us over time in that and as we as jack said in his comments weve got theres contractual rundown periods for this so from a financial perspective theres a large opportunity for us over time weve spent a lot of time on this decision thinking about it and the jack went through a lot of statistics in his prepared comments about seeing substantially higher levels of digital engagement the fact that some of the recent acquisitions have changed the complexion of our traditional branch network which gives us confidence that we can do this with a very reasonable and small risk of deposit attrition over time john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc we have a pretty long track record of closing branches optimizing the branch system over time and weve been really successful at retaining customers basically redirecting them to nearby branches and so that gives us a lot of confidence we have described over the years a kind of a hub and spoke approach to the way weve established our branch system in connecticut and we were able to replicate that some in new york and it really is that many of our stop shop branches are fairly close to traditional branch so weve always recognized that as a business model risk going into the instores and we intentionally created that hub and spoke approach and peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 as the world has changed and customers preferences have changed we now feel we need to take advantage of the expiration of these contracts and take this strategic step q thanks for that and just switching over to the loan growth side there are some headwinds theres expected runoffs still going on in resi and multifamily in the united book i guess what are the key drivers for kind of the net loan growth as we look at r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi its david growth is as i go down the balance sheet the continued success that weve had in equipment finance and i would say particularly led by leaf some of the specialized industry verticals that weve talked about in the past whether its franchise lending fund banking etcetera in as a plan strategy when we were remixing the balance sheet we also faced the headwind of a declining residential mortgage portfolio that process from our perspective has weve gotten to where we want to be for an allocation of the balance sheet so as we look forward well start to see some growth in the residential mortgage line mortgage warehouse is had a banner year obviously in but rates are low refinance opportunities are still out there for a large part of the mortgage universe so we think we will be able to hold balances fairly well in that business those positives i would say are offset by continued reduced activity in our commercial real estate book q thank you operator thank you your next question comes from dave rochester with compass point your line is now open david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good evening guys just on that last question in terms of runoff in acquired loans and runoff in new york city multifamily what do you guys have left in that or what are you expecting for this year maybe r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure dave good question so the new york multifamily was ended the year at million so that came down million in we think runoff next year will probably be million to million and then in the united portfolio we ended the year in the runoff section of that portfolio of million so that came down million last year we think the runoff there will be about million to million peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great and the loan guide includes the net of all that r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yes it does david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah great and then just on the nim guide i was wondering what youre assuming for the shape of the curve i know you talked about not assuming rate hikes and it looks like the guide assumes upside from the nim so just wondering what you see driving that if its just an unwind of some of the effects of liquidity build or maybe the ppp forgiveness fees or something like that r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah well i think you hit on most of what i was going to bring up dave so the million to million is as jack said its predicated on no change in the fed funds rate for the year we have seen a modest steepening of the yield curve and think well see a bit more as the year unfolds some of the components that were thinking about the one that really came to bear on the margin in the fourth quarter was the excess liquidity right so we had if you look on the shortterm investment line in the press release youll see that we were up billion in the fourth quarter the reality is that money is sitting at the fed right now at basis points so that had in in the fourth quarter a basis point negative impact to the margin we invested we grew the securities portfolio about billion in the fourth quarter and we are continuing to deploy some of that excess liquidity into the securities market so well be able to reverse some of that basis point drag there i think that will probably offset some of the positive benefit we think well get in the payoff of the ppps right which in jacks comments talked about in the first half of the year so about half of our loan book is floating and its really not going to change much but half of the loan book is fixed rate and theres about billion in equipment financing there that cash flows fairly nicely and each quarter we expect to get a little better reinvestment yields on that half of the loan portfolio so that and deploying some of that excess liquidity and picking up a little over basis points to basis points on that excess liquidity are some of the major drivers were thinking about around that loan guidance around the margin guidance david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah yeah and so for the nii indiscernible how much in the way of securities growth does that bake in for the year at this point roughly r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc for theres call it about another billion net growth peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great and then maybe just switching to capital real quick it looks like youre already at the top of your target cet1 range so i was just wondering what youre thinking about in terms of maybe buybacks or ma youve got one growth in your guide so youll need some to support that but if youre already in the top your range and youre making more money you may have some extra to do something with r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah true we are at the top of the range and we didnt feel we wanted to change the range in the guidance or from an outlook perspective the reality is and we talked about this i think last quarter when we announced the insurance sale that was about basis points boost equity levels we continue to think about and once in a while talk to our board about buybacks and that is certainly something that might happen over the course of the year its not planned today its not in our guidance but it is definitely just one of those capital management tools that we have regular periodic discussions with our board around david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc and on ma any updated thoughts there john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc its jack i would say no updated thoughts and i think we continue to look at the environment and have discussions with the people and obviously theres been a lot thats happened out there i think the challenges around the environment certainly causing people to at least look at their strategic alternatives and consider that as opposed to continuing to fight a way here david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc yeah okay great thanks guys i appreciate it r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you operator thank you your next question comes from mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler your line is now open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good afternoon john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc mark peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co just a quick a couple of quick followups on the instore thing and i apologize if you mentioned this but how many of the instore locations can you exit in r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc how many can we close in mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co exactly john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc by the end of they will all have been closed john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc and mark there was an original agreed upon schedule i think its yeah r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah im sorry john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc so all through and thats welllaid out and its kind of agreed years ago indiscernible actually years ago with both parties in an orderly unwind if there was one would kind of go by county and we dont have our fingertips on that indiscernible right here but well we can well begin to share that as we move through this but we are we indicated were actively talking with the stop shop and we are about both those schedules and also where we might continue working with them it wont be in a big footprint but we believe that we will reach some agreement with them following those discussions mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 and presumably jack theyll bring in another partner so i guess im curious do these branches have to stay dark for a period of time after you close them before somebody else could sort of move in there john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc no we watch the instore market pretty closely mark as you can imagine and instore presence across the industry has been in decline for some time that would be an awfully big thing for anybody to take on and were not expecting they will so thats our view on that and we have traditional branches close by so we like i said were confident well move those customers to the traditional branches and be successful mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co got you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc but im expecting it mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co and then david im curious on you touched upon the billion of short term investments did i hear correctly that you expect to put about billion to that to work in the securities portfolio r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yes mark so we grew the securities portfolio about billion on a net basis in q4 at the end of the year we were sitting on billion in change of liquidity and that was up in the quarter of billion so about half our current thinking is about billion of that billion at least right now we will deploy in the first half of mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you and then just lastly to followup on the ma question jack it sounds like theres a lot of things going on out there could you envision doing a bigger sort of moe kind of transaction is that something that you would consider john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc i would say that we look at the landscape all the time and theres at least some potential eventually that we would consider that with the right partner i would say i definitely would not say absolutely not those are difficult but certainly possible i dont i guess i would say it this way as well were really confident in our track record and execution on ma and if we felt like there was an appropriate thing there i wouldnt i would feel very good about our talented folks going and taking something on there but those are low probabilities mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 operator thank you your next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good afternoon john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys i just want to sorry for going back to the stop shop i just want to make sure i get the impact right i think you guys said million to million of expenses related to this action nothing this year but next year before any reinvestment that would be the savings from that i guess number one is is that the right way to think about it and weve seen others do branch closures and maybe gets reinvested is that am i in the zip code about how youre thinking about potential net savings in r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so that million to million is our allin cost for the totality of stop shop branches in both states so thats rent comp and benefits occupancy allin we did not say what percentage of that would be reinvested specifically but that is the opportunity from a cost savings john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah were already investing in our digital capabilities very steadily for years and were certainly committed again in to follow this year where it simply made a point that it is going to give us the capabilities to use some of it but i wouldnt use the thought of i dont think as i sit here today that we would feel like we would need that much christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay so that net benefit would be a event i got it okay r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc we really think about that more as a event not a christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay thats helpful just one more on the ppp i think you gave the numbers of what was in the quarter about million how much whats left on the fees and then secondarily what are the thoughts on the round two at participation peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sure so in the total net interest impact of fees and interest income was million now that was over three quarters obviously second third and it was ramping up over that period of time were making the assumption that what remains on the books will all be forgiven in the first two quarters of the year that number is just about the same amount its about million christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats total between the and the fees correct okay r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah yeah thats the total and then christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for taking r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so were actually calling whats going on right now ppp3 internally and thats just starting to ramp up its weve only been added two days now and our thoughts around that are not embedded christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc right r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc in the outlook were sharing today john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc ill just share i think it was this morning that approximately applications already mostly on the small size less than and good utilization of our technology and our portal of customers actually making the applications themselves and not needing to engage with our bankers so its early but it seems to be active were not expecting its going to be anywhere near ppp1 but we dont know so well see christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks a lot for taking the question john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 thanks operator thank you your next question comes from ken zerbe with morgan stanley your line is now open kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi great thanks maybe just a little more a theoretical question for you if you dont mind when i always think about banks and branches obviously people have not been going into them as much but theyre definitely used as a marketing tool and its great to just have that brand presence out there just like because i shop at stop shop i see peoples its definitely very helpful like how are you guys thinking about that aspect of it like ph actually more specifically how do you think about growing the business without sort of that im going to say free marketing of having branches in many more locations john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah well i appreciate what youre saying and noting that and i think traditional branches do that for us as well right and historically always have and even a bigger presence and were very much committed to that meaning bigger signage and more cars going by et cetera so that and i the other thing in terms of growing the business we are doing so much more in the digital marketing space than its just ramping up incredibly fast and so our messaging to people is coming more through the technology and the cellphone and the computer with offers and visibility on product and what the brand is doing what also what were doing in the community and we use digital a lot to talk about our community activities and the foundation as well kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thats helpful and then just a separate question in terms of the goodwill writedown or the goodwill impairment test that youre doing i guess i maybe that caught me a little bit off guard i wouldnt expect in this environment that we would see any goodwill writedowns can you just talk about what parts of your business are potentially subject that might ph impose a risk of a writedown thanks r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah hey ken its david so what we try to say in those prepared remarks and in the press release is this is an accounting exercise the date that we do this happens to be october so a part of that process a complicated process has to do with market cap on the day of assessment as which for us we have a stock price billion market cap also there is analysis relative to peers us and the peers were all trading about to times tangible book value so that is a piece of it so you run that assessment that accounting exercise over the units that we report in our public documents so thats just commercial retail and wealth management our three operating businesses so its complicated its a difficult valuation date but it is the date that these assessments happen every year sometimes more often but at a minimum whats somewhat interesting by this is at yearend we had a market cap that was up another billion to billion from that point if we were doing this at it wouldnt be an issue right there wouldnt be the possibility of an impairment charge but were dealing and working with our outside auditors and valuation team that we work with and were doing it around the date that we have to its proven to be a difficult date for us peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay i understand all right thank you very much r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you your next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets your line is now open steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good evening guys john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi steven steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just wanted to touch on the margin your cost of total deposits continues to ph climb lower do you think that by the end of this year you would fall below basis points r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i think that is possible if we continue to see these my word massive inflows of deposits into our company and were not obviously the only one whos experiencing that then i think the industry needs to do what it can to preserve margin so its possible we know what the role is on our cd book thats the part of the book that theres contractual pricing on but theres a fair theres a large differential between those cds that are rolling off in our current offering rate and thats why that book is going down and the money is because rates are so low just is going to noninterestbearing accounts with us or money market rates even lower theres a clear preference for liquidity amongst customers and because the industry is this is an industry issue theres really very little opportunity for customers to go elsewhere for any rate pickup thats meaningful enough to make it worthwhile so thats the long answer to yes i think thats possible steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great and with all these deposits i know you guys are taking your fhlb borrowings down considerably do you still is it going to be stable that going forward or can we expect that to go down further r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc the home loan advances that are on the book now are all term advances at this point so and theyre at relatively good rates so we really havent spent a lot of time thinking about prepaying them and incurring any peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 modest charge to do that so i dont know the exact term structure of how much might come off this year but whatever it is thats probably all the change will be and it will be relatively modest steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it and if i could just squeeze one last one in just on your nim guidance is that thats not assuming a further steepening in the yield curve r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well its just based on current forewords what i was trying to say is short rates are not going to move this year thats what the markets telling us thats what the fed is telling us but we have seen a modest steepening of the yield curve in the last call it two months and i would say market expectation is for a little bit more steepening but its relatively modest steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate it thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc youre welcome operator thank you your next question comes from matthew breese with stephens inc your line is now open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good evening everybody john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey maybe just going to the provision and the credit outlook i appreciate the guidance on the provision for this year just curious given the sharp reduction in deferrals and the clear comfort on the credit front could you give us just a little bit more color or insight as to how you think chargeoffs might trend this year john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc right now were not looking at a dramatic shift at all performance has been really good actually its really pleasing when you think about what weve all been through here in the last months so think about where delinquency has gone and how we and banks have dealt with people that were i would say ph have normally hit peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 but from a chargeoff perspective our experience this year is really on unique situations most of them prepandemic kind of troubled situations and like the past we get those once in a while but not at a high level matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then with that in mind considering where the reserve is how long might it take for you to get back to that cecl day one level as the pandemic is increasingly put in a rearview mirror r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc boy thats a tough thats tough one to guess on john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah i clearly agree with that we put a provision estimate out there we spread at million which is the first time weve ever done that as a company and normally were always comfortable with million and were always within that range we just spread at an extra million from the perspective that things are getting better thats clear chargeoffs for us for the last couple quarters have been relatively low and steady weve been able to bring provision expense down youve seen some banks start to release reserves weve been a little reluctant to do that yet we think that will probably unfold we hope that unfolds in but we just want to be conservative in our view points at this point and its really cecl scenariodriven which is another way of saying its economic forecastdriven matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay and then just going back to ma maybe i was hoping you could provide some color on the markets across your footprint that you want to be figuring you want to be better in if youre to stack order where there was a target and you would take advantage of it what are those markets john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc well im not ready to go there you could look at our whole footprint and know that were aware of it and as weve always said weve and we would kind of weve always done where we look across our markets for opportunities to do win market deals and also look at markets adjacent matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then just last one for me with all the digital discussion i just want to ask and get your thoughts on the occ letter from a couple weeks ago pertaining to blockchain stablecoins for payments have you made all these investments in digital technology is that something youve been pursuing we dont hear a lot of regional banks certainly not a lot of community banks talking about this and just curious what your thoughts were there john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 yeah we have not been pursuing it certainly we pay attention like others on how thats all developing but its not anything that were working on matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great thats all i had thank you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you operator thank you your next question comes from david bishop with seaport global securities your line is now open david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah thank you gentlemen good evening john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi david david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc hey ph i had a question youd mentioned that youre expecting some benefit from the rolloff of cds at a higher rate to a lower rate just curious what that differential is in terms of offering yields on the cd portfolio r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc top of my head dave i dont have the exact numbers but i think that current differential is about basis points or so its quite significant our offering rates are dependent on term probably only gets up to maybe or basis points david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc got it and then noted the strength and i know its been building across the year on the commercial lending fee side in terms of fee income just maybe some commentary in terms of the outlook for commercial banking fees into thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i mean thank you for recognizing even in a pandemic year commercial banking lending fees were up there are some good news and bad news in there id say the bad news is we did benefit from commercial real estate mostly payoff fees right we like the prepayment fee we hate to lose the balance so thats the one thats hard to call and thats the good newsbad news piece that we we experience that every year peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q4 earnings call 21jan2021 the good news when i think about commercial banking fees is the even in this year weve seen nice syndication fees out of our efforts to build those capabilities were leading more credit deals were earning servicing fees on some of those deals whether its in our health care or our fund banking group or even our mortgage warehouse group so the commercial fee activity and generation capabilities continue to get stronger last year was a tough year for our interest rate swap business we were down about million in aggregate yearoveryear and were we stand ready for every customer interest we have its just when origination activities are subdued those activities are also subdued as soon as activity levels come back well see a resumption of those fees and they arent the type of fees that will come back strongly and quickly david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc got
