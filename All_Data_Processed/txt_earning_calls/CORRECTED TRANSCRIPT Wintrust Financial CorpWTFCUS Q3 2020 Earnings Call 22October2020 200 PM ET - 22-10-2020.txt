joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 thank you very much welcome everybody to our third quarter earnings call with me as always are dave dykstra our chief operating officer dave stoehr cfo kate boege our general counsel tim crane president and rich murphy our credit guru we have the same format as usual im going to give some general comments regarding the results im going to turn it over to dave for more detailed analysis of other income other expenses and taxes back to me for a summary and then time for questions so first of all continues to be full of surprises and unpredictable if it werent for cecl covid and their effects on interest rates i think wed have experienced pretty much a gangbuster year in that regard though its nice to record earnings again earnings were million for the period or a share yeartodate earnings were million or a share pretax preprovision premsr million compared to million in q2 the net interest margin was down basis points ill go through that roa of rote of our net overhead ratio at basis points so pretty good on all fronts from that regard net interest income in the margin first net interest income was down approximately million primarily due to the reduction of ppp fee recognition of million resulting in slowerthanexpected forgiveness estimates and the ph banks elevated liquidity numbers indiscernible ppp amortization the first part of the latter part will be the liquidity issue be discussed in a second the nim decreased basis points to earning asset yields decreases of basis points were offset by a 19basispoint increase in decrease im sorry in paying liabilities free funds contribution decreased by basis points due to the lower cost of funds the remainder of the decrease relates to the aforementioned indiscernible ppp fee accrual that was basis points the yield around is our current number for ppp yields going forward if you look at this in terms of the margin without ppp thats taking out the ppp money interest income and fees less our cost of funds our core net interest margins was relatively constant at million we believe that we can build off of this going forward i think this is the low point we think that through investing and liquidity our loan demand indiscernible to basis points gets you back to the to we said we would bottom out at were currently carrying over billion indiscernible money in negligible yields the overall duration of our entire liquidity management portfolio is years down indiscernible in q2 and years at the previous year end as a reference point we usually try to keep it at to year range redeploying these assets and the loans and other earnings assets and shrinking our deposit base by reducing institutional funding indiscernible to support ppp loans indiscernible extend to basis points over time as i said it brings us back in line with the margin plus or minus weve previously indiscernible number its a very fluid situation in times like this you can imagine the optimization to take a few quarters dependent on actual ppp run off etcetera a little bit more on this later credit quality based on conventional metrics is remarkably good you wouldnt think that there was a pandemic going on npls decreased by million over q2 to million or basis points compared to basis points at the end of q2 npas decreased million to million or basis points as compared to basis points the end of q2 wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 covid modifications fell to million billion at june representing of total loans net of ppp loans chargeoffs net in the quarter totaled million or basis points the chargeoffs include million indiscernible on individual loans which were in place at provision for the quarter totaled million as compared to million in q2 indiscernible to the portfolio growth the portfolio ratings remain relatively constant with prior quarters details of ratings migration are included in the earnings release slide deck the allowance ph for outstandings is million or of loans excluding ppp loans core ratio that is loans net of premium finance loans and ppp loans is at hard to believe that credit is as good given the environment be assured were not going to let our guard down here were not naive enough to think that there will not be bumps in the road going forward but in any case were actually reserved right now on the onetimer front for the quarter negative onetimers include million to settle a mortgage banking dispute related to believe it or not million of a contingent consideration related to a previous acquisition of and million of acquisition expenses million of additional consideration that we believe will cover the fourth quarter in the next year the numbers get negligible in terms of the amount we would owe under that so we think weve got it covered now but we need more indiscernible the mortgage business is still on fire we also recorded million decrease in msr valuations due to continuing falling mortgage rates we now have close to billion of service the msr service portfolio so any rise in rates is certainly going to be the beach ball underwater and indiscernible we also recorded a million pretax settlement of an uncertain state tax position so other than the million of msr valuation onetimer was basically washed so a quick on other income other expense dave is going to cover in detail but a couple of general comments as you know although the mortgage business was extremely strong it appears this trend will continue at least for another quarter based on pipelines and hopefully longer always dependent on interest rates so the mortgage business is an integral part of our overall strategy when rates go down the mortgage business kicks in and helps while we readjust the balance sheet to optimize earnings in that regard we retain a positive gaap pretty much all times and this is an offset to that so you cant look at the mortgage business separately and try to break it out because when you think about it its given us the time and the earnings to get the margin going again and well talk about that a little bit later but it is an integral part of the business part of our strategy part of our internal hedge to optimize earnings in any rate environment for all the reasons we maintain a positive gaap is that we know that this business can cover for ph any period of time of falling rates so to consider it outside as separate this is an integral part as i said an integral part of what we do and its an integral part of our strategic plan and how we manage the balance sheet manage earnings so even when they fall off we get another couple quarters of really strong margins theyre not going to fall off in total by then we believe that the margin will be back at range as we grow we are a growth company we will grow through this as evidenced by growing almost billion over billion in the last year alone we have a great halo effect going and well talk about the deposit growth in a second on another note wealth management revenue continues to track to be was back on track to million assets under administration grew billion or to billion growth was in all three business areas trust the brokerdealer and asset management the majority of the growth occurred in asset management institutional accounts accounted about billion of that growth indiscernible good revenue going forward wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 again the net overhead ratio ph or basis points well below and that certainly helps mostly from the mortgage business and thats evidenced it makes up for the margin decline we hope to pick up going forward on the balance sheet front we grew million in total assets to billion our earning assets were up billion average earning assets billion from billion our loans grew million in a period of time where people our competitors are not having loan growth our loan growth is very good and our pipeline is stronger than ever we have a million head start given the average standing balance and again our loan pipeline is extremely strong we expect very good core growth loan growth in the quarter on a positive front we grew million thats a little bit misleading kind of a tale of well let me go back a second if i could on the ppp loans balance has actually increased in the quarter by million to billion currently billion and loans under forgiveness process about athird of the portfolio is in the indiscernible for forgiveness the deposit story weve said million quarteroverquarter but its a story within a story as mentioned in the last earnings call deposits as of that date when we had the last earnings call about billion less than a quarter at the end of the second quarter which means we ph got billion in core lower cost deposits as these deposit ran off or higher deposit costs and the billion is more core and a result of our business development the halo effect on ppp and continued general growth throughout the franchise pardon me in q4 weve arranged to return approximately million of institutional deposits we have brought on to fund ppp loans and for general liquidity at the end of q1 when the world was getting pretty crazy the core deposit growth remains strong so we do expect the core deposits will grow to offset that decrease but again at lower cost and ill turn it over to dave whos going to talk about other income and other expense david a dykstra vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you ed ed touched on the wealth management revenue a bit but in the noninterest section that wealth management revenue increased million to million in the third quarter compared to million in the second quarter and was up from the million recorded in the year ago quarter the revenue source has been positively impacted by higher equity valuations which impact the pricing on a portion of our managed asset accounts and also due a higher level of trading in our brokerage accounts from the depressed levels that we saw in the second quarter this year on the mortgage banking revenue front it increased by or million to million in the third quarter from million recorded in the prior quarter and was up a strong from the million recorded in the third quarter of last year the company originated billion of mortgage loans for sale in the third quarter essentially the same as the originations that we had in the prior quarter and was up from the billion of originations in the third quarter of last year the increase in this categorys revenue from the prior quarter resulted primarily from an increase in mortgage servicing revenue as a result of the larger servicing portfolio and a higher level of capitalization of msrs and a smaller negative msr valuation adjustment during the third quarter relative to the second quarter the production revenue was relatively stable but up slightly as the production margin on similar volume stayed level with the wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 prior quarter these aforementioned increases in mortgage revenue were offset somewhat by an additional expense accrual of approximately million in the third quarter for the settlement of a long standing recourse obligation dispute that puts that dispute to rest its been out there related to loans that were basically a decade old and we felt it was appropriate just to put that dispute to bed we currently expect originations in the fourth quarter of to be strong although there may be some seasonality well see how it works out winter months tend to slow the purchase business a little bit and there are holidays involved in november and december but the pipeline is very strong we expect it to be a strong fourth quarter margins may come down a little bit depending on that volume well see how it works out but for fourth quarter of the year we expect it to be extraordinarily strong table of our earnings release provides the detail of all the mortgage banking revenue components if you want to dig into that further other noninterest income totaled million in the third quarter down approximately million from the million recorded in the prior quarter the largest decline of revenue in this category related to lower swap fee income of approximately million there were a variety of other smaller positive and negative variances in this category that essentially offset each other turning to the noninterest expense categories noninterest expense totaled million in the third quarter up approximately million or from the million recorded in the prior quarter turning to the more significant changes quarteroverquarter the salaries and employee benefit category increased approximately million in the third quarter from the second quarter of this year the biggest portions of that are the employee benefit expense which accounted for about half of the total increase and was up approximately million from the prior quarter and that was due primarily to substantial increases in employee insurance claims as employees have begun to return to a more normal pattern of seeking health care and they also are catching up on services such as discretionary doctors visits and surgeries which have been deferred during the early stages of the coronavirus pandemic accordingly the second quarter expense was unusually low and the third quarter expense was unusually high however the average of the two quarters is generally in line with the prior quarter run rates and our expectations additionally salaries expense was up approximately million from the second quarter the primary cause of the increase was approximately million of lower deferred salary cost relative to the prior quarter which had higher deferred costs related to the ppp loan volumes that we had in so less of salary deferrals in the third quarter because we didnt do the substantial amount of ppp loans in the third quarter additionally the company incurred a little bit more expense to support the significant mortgage volume being processed through the system commissions and incentive comp expense increased approximately million in the third quarter that change was driven largely by additional commissions related to wealth management and brokerage trading activity as well as higher incentive compensation expense recorded during the third quarter relative to the second quarter data processing expense decreased approximately million in the third quarter compared to the second quarter due primarily to approximately million of conversion charges incurred related to the countryside acquisition in the second quarter and whereas the third quarter was void of any such acquisition related conversion charges professional fees declined by million to million in the third quarter compared to the million recorded in the prior quarter now these professional fees can fluctuate on a quarterly basis based upon the level of legal services related to acquisitions litigation problem loan workout as well as consulting services this category of expenses was down slightly from the prior quarter due to small declines and a variety of expense types but nothing of any significance related to any particular category the professional fees categories averaged about million over the past five quarters so the current million is a little less than that but within what we think is a normal range wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 equipment expense totaled million in the third quarter thats an increase of million as compared to the second quarter the increase is due to increased software licensing expenses including some increases related to increased online mortgage usage ppp loan servicing enhancements network upgrades to support our growth in digital enhancements and various other software upgrades and well continue to invest in software and technology to enhance our customer delivery systems and products as well as investment systems and support our continued growth other than those expenses that i just discussed all other expense categories were actually down on an aggregate basis by approximately from the second quarter ed mentioned that net overhead ratio stood at basis points which is down basis points from the basis points recorded in the second quarter and on the yeartodate basis the net overhead ratio was the ratio continues to benefit from strong balance sheet growth and strong mortgage banking results moving on to income tax expense the effective tax rate in the third quarter of this year was approximately which is well below the to range that we would normally expect the reason for the lower tax rate in the third quarter related to million net income tax benefit recorded during the third quarter related to the settlement of an uncertain tax position with taxing authorities wed anticipate the effective rate to return to the expected rate of to in the future quarters barring any unanticipated events id also like to take a few seconds to address the preferred stock dividends there seem to be some confusion out there if i look at some of the analyst estimates on what the preferred stock dividends should be on a going forward basis so the company recorded million of preferred stock dividends in the third quarter however on a going forward basis given the existing outstanding issuances and dividend rates and if declared by the board of directors the amount of preferred dividends recorded should approximate million the reason for the higher amount in the third quarter was that the first dividend period was of a fivemonth period there was really a twomonth stub period in may and june and then the normal quarterly period for the third quarter so in the first period the dividend declaration included five months but in all subsequent periods the dividend should be a threemonth period so slightly high in the third quarter here at million but going forward given the existing issuances rates et cetera that amount should be million so just wanted to clear that up as there seemed to be some confusion about that and with that i will turn my comments back over to ed edward joseph wehmer founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks dave i got to say were very pleased with the quarter i couldnt be proud of the wintrust team the strategic agility theyve displayed throughout these unusual times as rich murphy put it once he said this is a miracle were able to operate from home and put up these numbers and grow like we are and keep credit where it is its really hats off to the entire wintrust team our approach going forward is really very simple we need to grow through part of this cycle by taking what the market gives us right now that means organic growth acquisition market is currently nonexistent through the valuations pardon me and uncertainty as to credit as to target the targets credit we will believe therell be opportunities as we get closer to the end of the pandemic but as of now there isnt a lot going on we need to monitor balance sheet in order to optimize net interest income and the nim as ppp loans continue through the forgiveness pipeline given our assetsensitive position we do have room for some fixedrate exposure and we will be looking for opportunities in this area although im not really excited about what happens on mortgage backs there are some opportunities and some things well be doing in the future that will help earning asset yields and help the margin our pipelines are stronger than ever were ready for ppp if that occurs we continue to monitor credit very very closely as you know therell be some cracks coming however reserves are robust our current metrics are wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 off the chart good were comfortable with current levels our current reserve levels are appropriate note that we will not change our conservative consistent underwriting parameters and policies for any reason whatsoever id like to go back to that core net interest margin concept that i threw out before the million june to september we believe thats a low point barring additional lowering of rates overall rate environment going lower our pipeline is strong if we believe that we can add billion little loans of this quarter and million in investments and put the spreads out thats a million to million quarterly impact for us thats what were doing weve got a lot of liquidity we have the liquidity here we could allow liquidity at the beginning of the period of really the second quarter was because of the unusual times indiscernible drew on their lines we think that was going to continue at ppp loans were letting some of that expensive liquidity run off its being replaced by core deposits at cheaper rates and so thats the plan going forward is to grow without that commensurate increase in expenses and weve been able to do so as indicated by this quarter another billion to our regular deposit growth and million worth of loans we expect that to continue going forward its going to take some time to work through this the ppp has found money as far as im concerned and the mortgage business is going to continue to support us until such time as we can continue to build the earning asset base up get a little bit more certainty in the market as to where were going but our net interest rate sensitivity position right now is around our net gaap is around or as covid runs off that was about which is wed like to keep it between and weve got covid not covid as the ppp loans run off theyre on at a twoyear average life i guess in our gaap calculations so we do have room there to add some fixed rate assets on both sides of the equation and still maintain a very positive gaap again you have to look at wintrust in total you have to look at our margin you have to look at our mortgage business all of these are internal hedges helping various interest rate times so to pull one out and say thats not going to continue without giving credit for the other side of the equation doesnt make a lot of sense i know weve got a question on stock buybacks and as you guys go forward in the questionandanswer period ill say we are considering it as we always do right now if we just run the numbers it might make some sense to do it because its accretive to both earnings and tangible book value but in any acquisition you can do and were sitting at about million to million worth of cash right now thats available wed like to keep our cash in the holding company but we have that opportunity of if the board still wants to go that way so with that thank you for your support we really appreciate it have faith in wintrust we put through the wintrust management team we have your best interest at hearts because your interests are the same as ours so with that well have to turnover to questions thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question is from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good afternoon edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi there edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp sorry i thought you liked games jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc not good edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp ph and the twins in the wild but lets keep going jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc we can keep it you can keep going at least im on a packer fan they had a rough game edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thats why we like you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah i thought it was a pretty good quarter but obviously people have questions about the outlook and i guess maybe ill talk about growth and the margin but in terms of growth its unusual to see the kind of growth that you saw and maybe you could touch on big picture what you think is different and do you think you can offset the ppp run off and actually show stable than maybe higher loans wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well i think based on the pipeline the commercial and commercial real estate pipeline yes its higher than its been in a long time right now our pullthrough rates are consistent our premium finance business continues the life insurance business continues to grow nicely and the commercial business continues to grow nicely the average ticket size is relatively constant around bucks i wish it was million bucks on the commercial side so we believe that well continue to have really good core loan growth at least for the foreseeable future on our terms still were not bending credit to get there im telling you a lot of it is the ppp halo effect pullthrough and were seeing an echo effect of that because the people who are pulling through are referring us to other people these are good accounts were taken from the larger banks in town nobody in particular its everybody in total proportionately but it seems like weve got very good momentum carried good reputational momentum and our name is out there so we feel very good about our growth prospects and thats an integral part of what we have to do here is to grow through this that being said if in fact we saw things turn you couldnt get paid for your risk saw lots of exceptions coming through wont be afraid to shut it down right now like we did in the past but we have a shoe to fall but were not seeing that now rich do you agree richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah no id say jon you know our business model well and one of the things that we always say is we will take what the market gives us and so last year cre was a big contributor to growth ci less so because of some of the things ed talked about we werent getting paid for the risk and the structures got just a little bit crazy so one of the things thats really encouraging so far this year is just the way that that growth is coming in its really very balanced cre is still a contributor but were seeing good ci growth as ed pointed out were seeing good growth out of the niches were seeing good growth out of the premium finance area so one of the things that really keeps me confident is just that all those engines are running pretty well right now so if you took the first three quarters and you netted out mortgages held for sale and netted out ppp loans were on an annualized track of about and that really requires everybody to kind of be getting their work done and based on what were seeing in the pipelines for all those were continuing to feel pretty good about loan growth edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp but the amazing thing to me is and well talk about this a lot is a lot of the old time really old names in chicago names you would recognize are now doing business with us theyve had long term relationships with the larger banks in town and theyre getting kind of fed up youd be amazed that some of the names were dealing with and they tell their friends and they tell their friends so little bit of a pyramid effect going on here which were very happy to be a recipient of jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right well thats good and then in terms of the margin getting the margin back to that 270plus type level i understand the strategy but just talk a little bit about the cadence how long do you think that will take to get back to those levels edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well ppp has got a run off and leave us with liquidity if you take it in and weve got to be able to put that liquidity to work plus we have to take the billion we have of overnight money and put that to work well currently wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 loan to deposit core basis with the ppp loans included weve got to run about and if you figure the growth that will be in here returns of deposit were putting in we think itll take two to three quarters barring anything else i would say around two quarters of if everything stays where it is we manage the funding properly thats where we think well itll take about two quarters to get there but its all a function of whats going on in the markets and if everything holds as it is right now i would say in two quarters well be back but other things can change you get a lot more i mean the deposit growth has been incredible for it absolutely core deposit growth is incredible were not going to turn it down because these are really good clients really good businesses weve got to get that to raw material ill take it all day at the prices were getting to that now as we bring in relationships with them because eventually those turn into larger relationships and lending relationships just to give you an idea tim crane is here tim why dont you talk about whats going on in the treasury department right now at least in the last quarter what happened timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp sure ed and eds talked about the halo effect this is one of the follow on pieces to both the ppp opportunity and any other credit opportunities to the treasury and services revenue that comes with and so weve had to add staff to handle the implementations that continue to come to us and well do that probably through at least the end of the year with the treasury revenue really just starting to show up probably in the beginning of the fourth quarter here and we think that will be relatively significant for us edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp picked up almost accounts timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp just already implemented with a number in the pipeline waiting to get set up edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah and revenue on that could be over million annualized so theres a lot of things going on here and weve got to grow through this and keep our expenses under control thats got to be the secret here to get earnings back and be prepared for higher rates because the beach ball on the water we talked about years ago jon i think that ones deflated now we got to get another one down there but its bigger than its ever been jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right thanks for help guys operator thank you our next question is from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for the question dave on the mortgage business you talked i think about the potential for margins to come in a bit maybe you could elaborate on how meaningful given how much theyve expanded year onyear wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp well a lot of it really just depends on where the pipelines are going i mean right now they look pretty full but if they decline and the margins generally decline as the pipeline comes down because people raised the margins as theyre trying to govern the amount of flow coming in so i think you could be in i think it could potentially have a three handle on the margins next quarter but chris i said that last quarter too i thought volumes would come in a little bit and margins would come down and the application flow was just astounding to us and that it stayed where it was and the purchase activity really bumped up in the third quarter and generally second quarter is bigger and theres still a lot of purchase activity going on out there in the marketplace so i could be surprised again but the fourth quarter also has holidays where some people defer their actions or just dont do it and therere more holiday days in the quarter so that could impact it too but im not going to give a specific number because i tried to give that guidance last quarter and i was wrong but i think if it tails off a little bit in the winter months they could come down to the christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks and just one more with the prospects of taxes going up can you remind me if anything is structurally different than when you guys got the benefit in in terms of just sensitivity to each point david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah well no well we were a deferred tax liability at the time so there is some benefit we still have a deferred tax liability there are some tax planning strategies we could do so if there is a change in congress and the administration and it looks like there could be some increases in taxes there are some elections we can take on depreciation and the timing of certain expenses that we think we can mitigate some of the increased cost of that tax law change but we are in a deferred tax liability so when we benefited last time when rates went down it would be a negative to us but it could be if you look at our current deferred tax liability like a million number but i think we can mitigate that substantially so there may be some impact but i dont expect it to be material edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp that we get from cecl christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks appreciate it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible operator thank you our next question comes from david long with raymond james please go ahead wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good afternoon everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi david how are you david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc im doing well im sure you guys are doing well after a great report like you put up last night with regard to the balance sheet and the size of the balance sheet your clients seem pretty liquid youve seen nice deposit growth do you expect deposit balances to come down at some point and does that hinder your ability to invest some of the cash you have edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well were kind of floating in there right now and one of the reasons we havent run along yet is exactly that is the money going to stay we usually we dont know how much of it is ppp money that hasnt been spent and will that go out if it does go out where will it go will it go into personal accounts and then to wintrust wealth management but we do believe that deposit growth and market share growth will remain strong just by virtue of the number of clients were picking up on the commercial side and on the retail side as a result of the halo effect and the echo of the halo effect so i think were okay in terms of deposits ill worry about that if it happens because by now everybodys having too much david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it okay and then in your reserve today what assumptions are you using for future stimulus edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thats a good question david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah we dont have anything substantial in there for guessing whether its going to be trillion or billion so if there is more stimulus we think thatll help us i think moodys assumed some continued stimulus so what moodys has in there is what our models would have because we use moodys economic scenarios but we arent putting any qualitative impacts into the assumption to say we think that theres going to be a ton of stimulus so what moodys got its got in for additional stimulus what our models run with edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp what scares me about the ppp round data if you do a change in administrations or what happens to tarp when the administration changed last time it changed all the rules and well you were going to have to offer it but it may not be is as simple as this really is right now or as the first ppp was but as i said before the government is not wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 the best counterparty they have we do have to take care of our clients theres a need out there and im thinking its on our projections what im thinking if it did come was reasonable itll be billion for us a third of what we had before to our existing customers and open the lines for additional customers coming in so that will be a good thing but i expect it to be kind of lumpier than this one david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it and then just the last thing if i can on the mortgage side of things the fannie freddie basis point charge expected to start here in december has that had any impact on volumes or spreads at this point or do you expect it to edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp well weve built it in last time it came weve got it built into our pricing models right now so we dont expect that the fact that they if they had not delayed it it would have eaten into our margins a little bit but given the fact they delayed it weve pretty much built that into our pricing schedules now david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for taking my questions i appreciate it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp thanks david operator thank you our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hi brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey how are you edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp living the dream brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc exactly you talked about funding costs it would seem like you may have some room to continue to move those down particularly on the cd side what should we be thinking about there wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp mr crane do you want to answer that timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yeah brock as you guys saw the interest bearing deposit costs went from million to million and youre correct we believe we continue to have some room about more than half of the cd book will reprice in the next year thats moving from the to about basis points basis points and so youre correct i think youll see continued progress in moving our funding costs down in the next couple of quarters edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp what was the low point is the if you took the low for each category you get into the mid so i think an early look now would get us 40ish or slightly below given what we see in terms of a normal run rate on cd repricing so over time i think basis points was the low we had the last time we have one of these rate environments and we would expect to get there probably mid next year brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp somewhere around here brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc great and most competitors are flat by flat in terms of loan growth i hear you in terms of talking about picking up new clients clearly thats driving some of it what was your loan utilization in the quarter i believe it was million last quarter has that picked up edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp stayed around million david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp norm was around million and thats where it went up to million or million beginning of the crisis and came right back down to million wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp seems to be normal david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp so the growth really wasnt increase in line utilization thats stayed relatively flat brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay its new clients okay got it thank you david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question is from terry mcevoy with stephens please go ahead terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc good afternoon everyone edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp terry first of all i think everybody on the phone should recognize that youve had a hole in one terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc i appreciate that wish my golf game had gotten a little better during covid but that hasnt been the case outside of that one shot edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc whenever we can get together drinks are on me wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and it doesnt sound like anytime soon given the mayor of chicago and the curfew so well have to go out early but my question edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp indiscernible i guess terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc exactly ed you mentioned a couple times in your prepared remarks youre starting to see some cracks and therere some losses coming i think was the expression i was wondering if you could expand on that is that the hotel portfolio which still has higher deferrals or there are some other kind of segments within the portfolio that was behind that statement edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp no it wasnt a specific statement we dont see them now but were on lookout for them weve always been our first loss is our best loss if we got an issue well take care of it right out of the box but my point was were not naïve enough to think that well get through this unscathed i cant tell you where or how but somethings going to hit and somewhere somehow surprisingly the franchise portfolio is doing pretty well and our hotel exposure is basically nothing rich do you want to talk about that richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah i know i think you answered the question exactly right i mean we look at all the materials classified assets all the time if something is really problematic were going to market accordingly and move on but things as generally speaking are holding together pretty well as ive said the high risk portfolios that we laid out for the last couple of quarters have performed amazingly well the franchise portfolio is largely made up of qsrs and i asked the question to that group this morning about are we back to prepandemic levels in that space and pretty much at or above because they have modified their business models so much again hotels are i can count on our hotel deals on one hand theres just not that many energy again were not a big energy lender so i dont know where were going to see some of these things pop as weve talked about in prior quarters you have some covidrelated industries that we have borrowers in those that are really highly affected things that are in the tourism things that are in more of the restaurant that is maybe not in franchise i mean its hard to say exactly where but if this pandemic continues throughout better part of next year i mean theres going to be real challenges on those types of credits but for right now were feeling okay wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp and i think that has all been accounted for in the buildup of the reserves that we have right now so id just go back to indiscernible saying just because indiscernible doesnt mean you shouldnt look over your shoulder weve got to be very vigilant and stay on this dont let anybody get complacent but we dont see it right now as i said at the beginning of my comments you wouldnt think there was a pandemic or any crisis going on looking at our credit book right now terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and then just as a followup maybe for dave i was hoping to get your initial thoughts on expenses in it looks like maybe advertising and marketing are down million yearoveryear so thats going to normalize we hope so thats about a million increase but what else anything else stands out as you think about next year david l stoehr a chief financial officer executive vice president wintrust financial corp no were going to obviously always have a little bit of salary increase for merit and pay but were going to try to hold the line as much as we can on the staffing front if you look at what we did on the we had some onetime indiscernible even in this quarter i mean we had million of contingent consideration on the earn out this quarter and had million last quarter so theres million there we had the settlement of some of these recourse obligations from had been going on for years that theres probably a few million dollars there a difference from what you would have that we think weve put behind us edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp acquisitions david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp and acquisition costs were in there last quarter we just had million alone just on the conversion charges so i mean i think there are some numbers in there that just arent going to happen again next year but we would hope that we could as ed said try to grow the deposit and the loan side of the equation and hold the line on expenses there will be some increase like you saw this quarter just on the technology and software side as we build out our digital platform and customerfacing systems but hopefully that helps on efficiencies and other areas of the businesses as far as the branches and the people we have etcetera theres offsets out there so i dont have a specific number for you terry but trying to hold the line on expense growth edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah we are going through and looking at our branch network were looking at the number of people who we have not laid anybody off or furloughed anyone during this period of time weve been able to repurpose them into ppp and what have you but i think that we have developed some efficiencies through this process to be carried through and just do normal attrition wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 we should be able to bring our head count relatively speaking down a bit because of this once we get to the ppp forgiveness which is becoming somewhat laborsome and were growing at the same time so a lot of them we had to repurpose people to do that so i think were going be okay in that regard well see though itll be who knows what next year is going to bring in terms of opportunities and in terms of growth terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question is from nathan race with piper sandler please go ahead nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co yeah hi guys afternoon edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp hey nate nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co just followup on your comments just now around office locations and so forth weve seen from some compares in chicago that theyve closed some locations just given that branch traffic has flowed considerably with economies closing down and so forth just curious what youre seeing in terms of the magnitude of opportunities if you guys do go down a branch consolidation path like you were just talking to edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp go ahead tim timothy s crane a president wintrust financial corp yes as we mentioned in the last call number one were seeing the change the increase in the use of electronic services at the other banks and thats encouraging to us and were also seeing obviously a different pattern in terms of how clients use our facilities were nearing the end of analysis that i would guess will result in the closure of some number of branches i dont think itll be trajectory changing but itll be roughly comparable to what youre seeing with some others the important piece though i think is that we still think there are markets wed like to be in so whether those are underserved markets or they are markets that we find particularly attractive we will also continue to selectively add some locations but both to eds point about how efficiently we can run the locations that are open and then ultimately the number of locations we need we think there will be opportunities wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co okay thats very helpful just changing gears a little bit and thinking about the commercial real estate growth in the quarter i think the one item that stood out to me in some of the tables i think in table one in particular was the growth out of state in other parts of the country that you guys dont outline specifically within that table so i guess is that just a function of you guys following some existing developers and clients to other parts of the country or is it just like you guys alluded to earlier just new clients adds that are occurring in geographies that are a little more attractive from an underlying perspective than whats happening in illinois and other surrounding states edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp rich want to handle that richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp sure yeah so i think you anticipated my answer to that question we have a really good client base that weve dealt with for a long time that as weve become gained expertise over the years and started looking at really expanding our wintrust presence in the commercial real estate area weve built up a very nice stable of good sponsors as time has gone on theyve asked us to follow them out to some of the opportunities theyve seen in different markets from texas to colorado to out on the east coast florida and were generally happy to follow them on those we dont do them all but generally speaking wed like the professionals that were doing business with and lending money to and so we try to understand those markets we get a good handle on it but it truly is a function of following the people that weve banked for a long time edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp general rule around here is our core portfolio has to have chicago nexus and its portfolio can go anywhere in the country leasing for premium financing and the like but the core portfolio has set on nexus to chicago milwaukee our market area nathan j race q analyst piper sandler co got it makes sense i appreciate you guys taking the questions and all the color edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp welcome operator thank you our next question is from david chiaverini with wedbush securities please go ahead david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 hi thanks a couple of questions for you starting with mortgage banking clearly this year its a blowout year double the revenue of the prior year and i was curious if we were to go back if we look out to and of course is probably going to be a strong year also but hypothetically if mortgage banking revenue were to go back to 2019s level how much of an expense reduction would come with that so if we were take and kind of divide that revenue in half looking out to either next year or the following year how much of an expense reduction would be related to that edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp pretty much the same percentage were using a lot of contracted labor now our ability to contract our expense base as the market contracts you might lose a month there but basically on a run rate basis you should be weve designed it so youre going to indiscernible down relatively quickly murph you want to richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp no thats exactly right i mean we have become much more nimble in terms of our ability to step up and correspondingly step down as the volumes dictate it wont be a lets say exactly one for one at any given point time but itll be close edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp yeah david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp i think generally the efficiency ratio in that business has been around or so one of the reasons our efficiency ratio is higher than our peers is we have a higher percent of our revenues in the mortgage banking area so theres a substantial amount of expenses that would come out of that equation edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp i think the difference between that to will be one our use of contract labor and two our use of the front end thats working wonderfully now the old days the front end was manual its all now its all digitalized taking costs out of business the third is a lot of the work that doesnt touch the customer is being done offshore on a per deal basis so those will fall off also so i think compared to the i think we talked about this in those were our initiatives and now theyre in full swing right now and so i think that the costs are now more per unit than they were fixed before richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp i can tell you that every time ed talks with our senior leadership team in the mortgage department he says congratulations on a great month how are you going to get your costs down when the revenue goes away so its definitely a focus wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp im becoming predictable i dont like that david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks for that color and then shifting to the provision outlook million in this quarter is clearly down substantially from the second quarter how should we think about the goforward provision i know its a very uncertain environment but is million kind of a good baseline going forward david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well you know i mean you know theoretically dave if you think about cecl its a life of loan concept so if the portfolio didnt grow and the credit quality stayed the same and the economic outlook was the same youd have zero right so the drivers for that are going to be if we have growth well have to provide for that growth if the portfolio would deteriorate or get better it would go up or down and then it really depends on the economic scenarios which drives it quite a bit so i think youd kind of look at this and have to just think about where you think the quality the credit quality and growth is going to go on the portfolio and then if they have stimulus and the economy gets better i mean theoretically you could say banks could start releasing reserves and i dont think were in that position yet because were not youre not seeing the economic scenario change dramatically but i think whats going to drive our provision going forward right now as i look at it would just be is the portfolio going to grow and that was this quarter you could see that we had some growth in the portfolio that helped drive that number up a little bit and credit quality is knockonwood holding in there right now so cecl is awfully complicated from that perspective but i think the issue really is growth here david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc that makes sense and last one for me is right where you just left off there on loan growth you mentioned about how pipelines are stronger than ever what type of borrowers are you seeing the most demand from in terms of loan growth and i guess related question to that are distressed investors swooping in and purchasing cre at this time richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp i can handle the first part and then ill get into the second part so where were seeing activity is really in chicago in the chicago market the pie i dont think is growing all that much we just continue to grow our share of that pie so weve talked for the last couple of quarters and on this call about the halo effect of ppp and it is very real i mean not a one of our credit approval meetings goes by where were not seeing a deal come out of pick your big bank because theyre just frustrated with the way that they handle ppp the way that they have sort of evolved which is a much less bankerfocused model more call centeroriented and as a result you were just getting indiscernible more often every time theres a deal that comes to market were sort of the guys sitting at the table so it really has i mean as i had said earlier in the call that our wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 visibility in the market is i think dramatically different than if you go back a couple of years and even if you go back just this time last year we sit in a different position the quality of the borrower were seeing where theyre coming from its a good place to be right now as it relates to the distressed assets and yeah we are seeing every day in my inbox theres probably another people sending notes saying hey were interested in buying your hospitality portfolio were interested in buying your cre portfolio and i think its just they send it out to everybody because theyre just trying to find as many assets out there as possible so there are a lot of people out there looking for distressed assets david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much operator thank you our next question is from michael young with truist securities please go ahead michael young q analyst truist securities hi thanks for the question maybe just wanted to ask kind of big picture if there was going to be some kpis or more high level articulation of financial targets kind of on the heels of some of this disruption i know you guys did some of the management reorganization to free up some bandwidth to kind of evaluate strategy so i just dont know if there was anything that had come of that or that we should expect in the future from that david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp no i dont think were going to give any sort of different guidance out there right now i mean the overall strategy is what were looking at and some of those as i said this is a very diversified business model here that if you set some of those goals and the mortgage market is stronger than sort of the interest rate environment has been recently or vice versa if rates go up and the margin expands and mortgages go down some of those kpis would change dramatically so were trying to manage the overall business and the diversified nature of it and i think if we start to provide you with very granular kpis out there were going to be explaining why theyre changing all the time because the business is somewhat fluid and so we take what the market gives us we try to stay diversified we try to take advantage of the revenue streams where theyre at and that you have to be able to adapt over time and not corner yourselves into certain kpis and say geez we have to meet those because youll give up on some other aspect of the business but rest assured as ed said earlier we are big shareholders of this relative to our net worth and we manage just like shareholders and we manage it for the longterm and not for quarterly returns and so well continue to do that but im not so certain that were going to put out more kpis michael young q analyst truist securities okay thats fair and then just on kind of back on the growth question i guess you kind of mentioned on your own credit things are good but youre worried something might pop up and im just curious how youve shifted maybe underwriting in terms of structure on new loans that youre pursuing to make sure that theres an appropriate margin of error safety on new loan originations will it be cre or ci thatd be helpful wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp we dont change our own policy basically for anything this business hasnt changed since the medicis in florence so we dont try to follow the herd any way shape or form but we have very conserved underwriting standards as our history would tell you we dont change a lot of them go ahead murph richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp yeah no eds right i mean i think we have been pretty consistent in the way that we underwrite credit and the way we structure deals id say to your point though ci i wouldnt say were doing a whole lot of overlays there from an underwriting perspective id say in the cre space were trying to be very mindful of what potential vacancy rates could look like in different segments were not doing a whole lot of office deals right now but were certainly we talk a lot about whats the core pro forma vacancy rates that you could applied to those edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp retail richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp retail we dont do any really right now but certainly when were doing reviews on those we are we kind of put those edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp stress them out richard b murphy a vice chairmanlending wintrust financial corp stress them out to a higher level of vacancy but in the new deals that we are doing we are trying to be very mindful of the things that we are concerned about i would say like in illinois we are looking at real estate taxes and thinking about okay heres where theyre at how much stress in those real estate tax expenses can we absorb here so id say if anything thats probably the area of most focus right now is on those cre deals and kind of doing the whatif scenarios on them to really understand them but again i think the biggest thing that we really do focus on and one of the things that were as we look through our existing portfolio is your sponsor selection is really critical i mean if you went in to this last six months with weaker deals and weaker sponsors youre going to have a rough ride ahead of you but we have seen in number of instances where weve seen sponsors step up and resized the deal and support deals where appropriate and ultimately thats what your protection wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 michael young q analyst truist securities okay thanks operator thank you and our last question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please go ahead edward joseph wehmer a founder chief executive officer director wintrust financial corp brock you come back for a indiscernible brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc i just cant get enough i wondered if you could just briefly walk through the ppp dynamics on the nim was that change related to a change in the term from say two years to five or driven by an update on the level of forgiveness that youre seeing david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp well its really driven on the timing of the forgiveness that were seeing based upon the customer surveys and the customer responses that we did we thought the forgiveness would happen quicker so we thought the cash flows would come in quicker then theres all this talk about maybe congress will pass a law that gives a one page form for everything under and some people talked about it or yeah some people talked about even higher numbers so we have a lot of accountants and lawyers advising our clients that hey why dont you just sit back no reason for you to fill out this lengthy forgiveness application if a simpler easier one is going to come through and so a lot of people have sort of held off with that being said about athird of our portfolio has got applications in now some of them have gone all the way through the process and weve got the cash others are actually at the sba waiting for the final process so we have them in different stages its just that that flow backed up on us a little bit because of the anticipation that congress or the sba may give a more simplified streamlined approach to the borrowers and so if they dont have to make a payment and they just sat back so we thought wed have more flow in the third and the fourth quarters we sort of pushed that back more towards the end of the fourth quarter into the first quarter and so its really you just recalculate what you think your level yield is going to be and how fast the accretion is going to come in that makes sense brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah got it okay thanks dave david a dykstra a vice chairman chief operating officer wintrust financial corp thank you wintrust financial corp wtfc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 operator thank you and this concludes our qa session i would like
