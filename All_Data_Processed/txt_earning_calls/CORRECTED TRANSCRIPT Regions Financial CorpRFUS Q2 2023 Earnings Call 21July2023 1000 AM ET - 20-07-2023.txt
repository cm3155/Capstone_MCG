financial corp thank you dana and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our call today once again regions delivered another solid quarter underscoring our commitment to generating consistent sustainable long term regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 performance we generated earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of and one of the best return on average tangible common equity ratios in our peer group at our consistent strong earnings performance has given the board confidence to increase the quarterly common stock dividend by which was officially reported in a press release earlier this week although some lingering economic uncertainty remains we feel good about our ability to carry this momentum into second half of the year we continue to benefit from our strong and diverse balance sheet robust liquidity position and prudent credit risk management our proactive hedging strategies have positioned us for success in any interest rate environment and our granular deposit base and relationship based banking approach continue to serve us well overall sentiment among our corporate customers remains relatively positive despite ongoing labor shortages persistent inflationary pressure and slowly improving supply chain issues in fact most are continuing to forecast solid performance in although later expecting modest declines from levels experienced in we remain committed to serving our customers while maintaining our focus on risk adjusted returns were being judicious with capital preserving it for our best clients and relationships yearto date the corporate bank has grown loans in line with our expectations with the vast majority of this growth coming from existing customers our consumer customers also remain healthy unemployment in of our top states remains at or near historical lows and housing prices in of our states are forecast to outperform the hpi index in wages in most of our footprint have kept pace with or exceeded increases in inflation and as a result consumer deposit balances and credit card payment rates remain higher than prepandemic levels our credit quality remained strong although normalization continues chargeoffs remain below historical throughthecycle levels we also continue to benefit from the strategic investments were making in our business for example over the last few years weve focused on enhancing our treasury management suite of products and services weve invested in talent and technology including data and analytics improving our ability to provide our clients with data driven insights today our relationship managers lead every prospective client conversation with a cash flow mindset enabling us to clearly understand our customer needs were very pleased with the success of our treasury management business which has produced revenue growth yearoveryear although our penetration rate for treasury management solutions ranks among the top versus peers we continue to see further opportunity in our existing customer base particularly in lower end commercial additionally during the second quarter we introduced regions nocost overdraft grace feature giving consumers the opportunity to remedy overdrafts and avoid fees to date the data indicates that customers are seeing an approximate reduction in the occurrence of a cess fees were excited about the financial benefits and flexibility our customers are enjoying as a result of changes weve made over the past two years we also continue to actively search for investment opportunities with respect to mortgage servicing rights and during the last months weve acquired the rights to service approximately billion in mortgage loans through a combination of bulk purchases and flow deals these are just a few examples of our commitment to investing in markets technology talent and capabilities to grow and diversify our revenue base and enhance offerings to our customers now david will provide some highlights regarding the quarter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 david jackson turner jr senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thank you john lets start with the balance sheet average loans increased sequentially average business loans also increased reflecting high quality broad based growth across the telecommunications multifamily and energy industries loan demand remained stable during the quarter and we had the opportunity to continue growing faster however as john mentioned we are committed to appropriate risk adjusted returns and now is not the time to stretch for growth we are focused on supporting existing customers where we have a relationship and proven history approximately of this quarters business loan growth was driven by existing clients accessing and expanding their credit lines average consumer loans increased as growth in the mortgage and enerbank was partially offset by declines in home equity and runoff exit portfolios looking forward we expect ending loan growth of to from a deposit standpoint our deposit base remains a strength and a differentiating factor across the peer set with balances continuing to largely perform as expected our deposits are highly operational in nature granular in size and generally receive more coverage through fdic insurance than most peers although banking turmoil late in first quarter introduced some additional uncertainty to the companys outlook deposits largely performed as expected ending the first half of the year down billion as part of our practice of maintaining a diversity of funding sources total deposits include approximately billion of deposits composed of brokered cds and wholesale market transactions recall this is in addition to the brokered cds we acquired as part of the enerbank acquisition which are maturing over time deposit declines came largely from higher balance and more ratesensitive customers across all three businesses we also saw continued diversification of customer dollars across various regions offerings such as from interest rate checking to cds or money market deposits and movement out of deposits to offerings through our wealth management platform and in the corporate banking segment utilization of off balance sheet money market mutual fund solutions in the case of corporate clients overall liquidity under management has remained solid increasing almost since the end of the first quarter looking forward a tightening federal reserve observed through increasing interest rates and reductions in the federal reserves balance sheet along with heightened competition will likely continue to constrain deposit growth for the industry through yearend accordingly we expect deposits to be modestly lower over the balance of the year and we expect the continued remixing into interestbearing categories so lets shift to net interest income and margin as expected net interest income declined by in the second quarter this represents the beginning of a reversion from elevated net interest income and margin levels back towards our longerterm range mostly due to deposit and funding cost normalization regions balance sheet remains asset sensitive as the federal reserve nears the end of its tightening cycle net interest income is supported by elevated floating rate loan and cash yields at higher market interest rates and fixed rate asset turnover from the maturity of lower yielding loans and securities at this stage in the rate cycle we expect deposit cost increases through a continuation of repricing and remixing trends importantly recent trends remain within our expectation the cycletodate deposit beta is and our guidance for is unchanged a cycletodate beta by yearend longer term deposit performance will be heavily influenced by the amount of time monetary policy remains tight deposit betas could ultimately exceed the in assuming higher rates for longer regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 regardless we remain confident that our deposit composition will provide a meaningful competitive advantage for regions when compared to the broader industry net interest income is projected to grow between and in when compared to the midpoint of the range is supported using june market forward interest rates or approximately one additional basis point hike this year third quarter net interest income is expected to decline approximately driven by continued deposit and funding cost normalization and the beginning of the active hedging period for a number of previously transacted forward starting receivefixed swaps the balance sheet hedging program is an important source of earning stability in todays uncertain environment hedges added to date create a wellprotected net interest margin profile through while no meaningful hedging was transacted during the quarter we continue to look for opportunities to add balance sheet protection beyond at attractive market rate levels since quarterend we have added billion of forward starting swaps and million of forward starting rate collars near recent highs that will become effective in and a resulting balance sheet is constructed to support a net interest margin range of to over the coming years even if interest rates move back towards if rates remain elevated our net interest margin is projected to remain at or above the midpoint of the range lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income increased from the prior quarter as increases in capital markets and card and atm fees were partially offset by declines in other categories total capital markets income increased million excluding the impact of cva and dva capital markets increased sequentially driven primarily by growth in real estate capital markets partially offset by declines in ma fees debt underwriting and loan syndication income we had a negative million cva and dva adjustment reflecting credit spread tightening during the quarter however this was a million improvement versus the first quarter card and atm fees increased driven by seasonally higher spend and transaction volume as well as a first quarter million rewards reserve adjustment that did not repeat service charges declined slightly during the quarter as john mentioned we introduced our overdraft grace feature in midjune based on our experience to date we now expect full year service charges of approximately trillion sic million with respect to outlook we continue to expect full year adjusted total revenue to be up to compared to lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expense increased compared to the prior quarter and includes the previously announced elevated operating losses related to check fraud excluding the approximately million associated with incremental check fraud incurred this quarter adjusted noninterest expenses remained relatively stable versus the prior quarter we have effective countermeasures in place and losses have returned to normalized levels salaries and benefits decreased primarily due to lower payroll taxes and 401k expense partially offset by an entire quarter of annual merit increases and higher head count the fdic insurance assessment increase was driven by changes in various inputs including normalized credit conditions and increases in average assets we remain committed to prudently managing expenses in order to continue funding investments in our business including optimizing square footage regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 as an example this quarter we entered into an agreement to sell two of our largest operation centers totaling over square feet we will continue to refine our expense base focusing on our largest categories which include salaries and benefits occupancy and vendor spend we expect full year adjusted noninterest expenses to be up approximately and continue to expect to generate positive adjusted operating leverage from an asset quality standpoint overall credit performance continues to normalize as expected net chargeoffs were basis points in the quarter nonperforming loans decreased while business service criticized loans and total delinquencies increased provision expense was million or million in excess of net chargeoffs the allowance for credit loss ratio increased basis points to and the allowance as a percentage of non performing loans increased to the allowance increased due primarily to normalizing credit modest economic outlook changes and loan growth allowance for credit losses on the office portfolio increased from to importantly the single office loan on nonperforming status is paying as agreed additionally the vast majority of our office exposure is in class a properties located primarily within the sunbelt overall we continue to feel good about the composition of our office book and do not expect any meaningful loss in this portfolio while we expect net chargeoffs will continue to normalize over the back half of the year we continue to expect our full year net chargeoff ratio to be approximately basis points we also expect to return to our historical throughthecycle annual chargeoff range of to basis points in from a capital standpoint we ended the quarter with a common equity tier ratio at an estimated although we were not required to participate in this years supervisory capital stress test we did receive our preliminary stress capital buffer reflecting planned capital changes including the dividend increase john referenced our preliminary stress capital buffer will remain at from the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of additionally we have access to sources of liquidity at june totaling approximately billion including collateral we have in a ready status at the federal home loan bank the federal reserves bank term funding program and the discount window these sources are sufficient to cover all retail uninsured deposits plus wholesale nonoperational deposits by approximately a to ratio given current macroeconomic conditions and regulatory uncertainty we anticipate continuing to manage capital levels at or modestly above over the near term and finally we have a slide summarizing our expectations which we have addressed throughout the prepared comments with that well move to the qa portion of the call regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning everybody thank you for taking the question just wanted to ask a little on the deposit pricing thoughts so you kept the interestbearing deposit beta assumption which is great but softened the deposit growth expectation a bit maybe a thought or two on how youre thinking about the balance between flows and pricing and then when we think about that beta assumption potentially going higher into next year as you had suggested visàvis the current expectation what are sort of the major puts and takes as you think about i mean obviously sort of time is a big one but would just be curious to hear your thoughts david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure this is david so with regards to deposit pricing its important that if i understand that we think about our customers we talk to our business leaders in terms of what we need to do to support our customer base and whats going on from a competitive landscape and so through that we form an opinion as to what our deposit beta ought to be and i would tell you that going into last quarter weve had beta now for just beginning of the year and we had a little bit cushion in that we believe pretty conservative based on what weve seen and the competitive pressures that weve seen and obviously events of march its probably not as conservative we believe is the right number but we dont have as much conservatism in it as we had with regards to what were thinking about beta going into we really needed to understand what the feds thinking and right now if they have one more increase and kind of stay on hold for a while you probably have a couple of quarters before betas start creeping up on you so we had originally called for the end of the cycle at the end of because this has been elongated a bit the cycle is going to continue into to some degree and thats all dependent on when they stop and so if they have one more increase at the next meeting itll be sooner if they keep going another increase after that itll be later so those are probably the biggest drive individual drivers you have other things like competition whether we have to be competitive and so what our competition does we have to react to some degree so thats another driver and then the overall fed balance sheet so the feds down about billion since the beginning of the year fed balance sheet is going to continue to drip down a little bit which will take liquidity out of the system and put some pressure on there so theres several things thats why its hard to be precise on what the beta is going to be but i think there should be some expectation that theres a little bit of a increase in the amount of which we cant tell you precisely well continue to look and search for that and update you as we change our opinion on that regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co wonderful thank you very much and then wanted to ask just a super quick one on sort of the background behind the favorable million adjustment you made to the expected full year service charges numbers sounds like its simply a better understanding based on the early observations from the rollout of the new initiative but would love to hear any incremental color you have there as well please john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah it actually wasnt that the driver is because our whats embedded in service charge is also treasury management and our treasury management group has done a great job this year growing relationships were up about our relationships and if you look at revenue our revenue on treasury management is up some and so we saw that happen in the first part the first quarter we want to see if it continued it did in the second quarter and so our service charge from 24hour grace is about what we where we forecasted it so you add all that together and just on a run rate basis you can see were going to be higher than what we had originally guided and that was the single driver r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you again i appreciate you taking the questions john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp sure operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please proceed with your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning david john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp hi gerard regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc david can you share with us i know we dont know what the final outcomes will be from the regulatory changes that are on the horizon possibly if we get them next week but can you share with us how you guys are thinking about how it might impact you in terms of the longterm debt portion of the tlac as well as the higher risk weighted asset assumptions possibly from mortgages which came out i think this week and any other issues that are surrounding this whole regulatory change thats on the horizon david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so let me just give you an overall comment and then ill break down some of the elements so overall gerard what were hearing what were seeing we can well be able to adapt and overcome whatever it is that we have to we think the fed is going to give us all time to adapt to whatever those changes are going to be without any major disruption so specifically on debt were hearing potentially a of rwa number for those over billion maybe theres some tailoring but lets just use the for easy math thats an incremental billion of debt for us that we will have to raise over time we will be able to leverage that billion into our business and including putting some of it at the bank that will reduce our deposit insurance premium some and when you wrap all that together youre talking about basis points to basis points of allin cost for us on that billion so youre talking about million bottom line hit if that were to happen fully implemented so its just not its not something thats pretty easy to overcome we dont think its necessary but we dont get to make the rules we just have to adapt and overcome with regards to the rwa so were hearing conflicting things theres clearly some additional operational risk were going to have to put into rwas were supposed to get some benefit though on the credit side whether it be from mortgages or investment grade if all that happens like basel intended then its a push and no big deal on the other hand if we dont get the benefits were supposed to on the credit risk weights then that will cost us a little bit of capital and again well tether that in over time outside of basel but probably part of the npr that will be coming out will be aoci aoci is likely to be in the capital regime going forward which in a stress basis actually is helpful because your aoci is in a gain position but in a rising rate environment which is good for banking because thats where we make most of our money from a capital standpoint youll have to tether that aoci in over time again theyre talking about starting maybe in or and then giving you three to five years to do that and again we can well be able to handle that some of that takes care of itself just because of the maturities of the investment portfolio and so and then rates coming down the other way so again the bottom line is where i started whatever it is well adapt and overcome gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then i think you guys mentioned that you sold a couple of operation centers or youre in agreement to sell a couple of operation centers i didnt hear are you going to vacate them as well or is it just more of a sales leaseback situation and then second the price you receive for them how does that compare to what they may have been valued a couple of years ago at regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so the first part is we will lease one of the buildings some of the square footage for a relatively short period of time to help us transition but for the most part were going to be vacating both of those buildings i mean the world has changed since weve built all that and we just dont need the space and of course working remotely has been a piece of that too so we think its a good deal not only for our customer base but for our community because whats going there we think will be very helpful to the community were going to be able to get out sell that it will be a book value to a slight gain on the sale not anything to write home about but well make a little bit of money on that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and david was the values lower than what you think if you would have sold those two or three years ago just to tie into the whole commercial real estate lower values that were hearing about john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah hey gerard its john im not sure its a relevant question were selling to the taxing authority that so were selling to the city that we occupied and our tax valuation was unchanged over the threeyear period and so its based on tax valuation so im not sure that we can give you a good answer to your question gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay no i appreciate that john thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc david just wondering your expectation for deposits to go down a little bit towards the end of the year and you mentioned the additions of some of those brokered cds im just wondering what you think of the trajectory for regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 average earning assets from here if indiscernible coming down a little bit and loan growth kind of given your clear view of that and just wondering how that fits in with your securities and cash in between in terms of what indiscernible does david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah i think youll see a modest decline there ken i think the deposit decline normalization remember we had a lot of surge deposits weve been calling for runoff a bit we were pretty close to our number through the second quarter rates are higher longer i think thats going to have some switching costs associated with it theres going to be some offbalance sheet movement as well we think our noninterestbearing drifts down to that mid which is what weve been calling for i think today were at about so as a result of that decline you should expect average earning assets to decline along with that when we talk about modestly were talking to frankly and but well see were continuing to grow checking accounts the core of our franchise are checking accounts and operating accounts and we are all over trying to grow that and take advantage of the markets that were in which is very favorable as we see the migration of people and businesses into our market so we think this is some more normalization and then we think it kind of settles out after that modest decline ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great okay got it and just on the loan side im just wondering resi mortgage and enerbank have been the biggest parts of your loan growth for a while now just wondering does that continue to be your expectation of where youll get the majority of growth and within that i guess if you can just give us an update on how enerbanks been doing relative to your expectations thanks david david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp sure so our growth has really been driven thus far in total from the commercial side that is going to slow a bit we can just as we talk to customers we could see the demand for credit isnt quite what it was obviously there are transactions that are harder to get done in real estate because we are based on where rates are were requiring more equity in the deal and developers dont want to do that so things dont happen theres still a big demand for housing resi portfolio we will continue to grow some we have a good group of mlos that are out there the housing supply is still way below where it should be now rates are up and so thats going to mute things from an enerbank standpoint weve had pretty good growth they have met the expectations that we have laid out for them well see some slowing a bit in the second half and into we had a pretty big solar program going at one time the math on that got to a point where it was not as profitable as we had originally hoped for and so we are not going to change chase loan growth until unless we can get paid appropriately for the risk that we take as a result thats going to slow a bit in enerbank that being said were very happy with what theyre doing and youre going to see growth just not at the pace that we have had ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc perfect great thanks david regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 operator our next comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point please proceed with your question david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc on your nii guide was just wondering about the timing of the rate hikes youre factoring in there it sounded like you were assuming july but just wanted to confirm that and then on your deposit comment that youre factoring in that decline further on the dva side and just overall was just wondering what the rough average cost is of that incremental deposits that youre bringing in to replace some of that dva whats your assumption there is it or is it closer to maybe some of your lower core accounts david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah its right at and youre correct we did factor in the increase rate increase in july david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay great maybe on capital the plan to manage cet1 at or slightly above given youre there now just wanted to get your thoughts on the chances of your restarting that buyback once you get more clarity on the capital requirements next week or do you think theres maybe a better possibility that you restart that in david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp it is probably more likely a we keep thinking were going to get clarification we thought june has been pushed out so we dont know exactly when were going to get it but whatever we do well sift through the material and well come up with an appropriate plan until we know that plan just doesnt make any sense i mean we had i think the highest return this quarter on tangible common equity theres just no need for us to push on the to push on share buyback right now lets just be a little bit cautious and deal with the new rules and then after that if buying our shares back is appropriate then thats what well do david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc okay and then one last one on credit just wanted to get your thoughts on your office reserve ratio at this point i know you dont know whats in the other office books out there like some of these other banks that were just seeing reserve ratios that are a little bit more elevated at some of the larger banks and i know you mentioned you dont expect any losses in that book was just hoping you could just talk a little bit more about whats giving you comfort with that the 2handle that youve got on there right now on the reserve ratio thanks regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah sure sure yeah this is john ill answer that so our office portfolio is about billion roughly of that portfolio is single tenant and of that single tenant exposure is investment grade so we sort of look at that million and feel like that we understand that its well secured is performing so then we look at the billion portfolio that remains thats multitenant of that is in the sunbelt beyond that it is well diversified geographically largest concentration we have is in the dallasfort worth market where about of the portfolio or exposure actually resides there are about credits make up that billion so we have very good visibility into the relationships and to the performance of those particular credits when i think about how were doing weve been talking to customers well in advance of maturities and we have a fair number of maturities in and performance to date has been good weve had credits that have matured already this year and over half of those or half of those credits had an extension option which they were able to exercise another 20pluspercent renewed based on our current credit underwriting standards and the balance either paid off we have one credit that were still working on thats the one nonaccrual that we have in the portfolio and so all in all our assessment of our portfolio our office portfolio is pretty good we have said we dont think we have any significant losses in the portfolio and thats been confirmed by again in conversations were having with customers our visibility into whats occurred to date and what we think will occur over the next to months david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great thanks for all the color appreciate it john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc can you guys just remind us where you are on the system upgrades on the loan and deposit platforms and what the benefits are once thats done regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we are in the formative stage of putting in our new systems focusing on the deposit system itll be the biggest and all of them are important to us but that was really important to us we are planning right now we are laying the foundation we are spending some money weve been spending money for quite some time but youre not going to see benefits for a number of years matt weve got to go through and what weve learned from talking to others that have gone through these type journeys is it is much better to take your time and be planful and will reduce ultimately will reduce the overall cost so were going through a number of customer journeys and really thinking through not just putting in a new system but how can we really transform how we do business and how can we make it easier for our customers to bank with us how we can make it easier for our associates to take care of our customers and so its a lot of work and so youre going to see cost upfront which is what were experiencing today before youll see the benefits itll be a few years out matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and remind us of the timeline i think it was back in you first started talking about it and i thought you said it might be five or six years but update us on the timeline please david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp thats right its going to be yet another five years from now before you see this so we have a deposit system well be putting in a new commercial loan system and well be putting in a consumer loan system as well but the biggest one and the most expensive one will be the deposit system thats at least three years out before that gets put in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning first question is clarifying sort of the statements on nii david so based on your guidance the fourth quarter net interest income exit rate will be somewhere between billion and billion sort of based on what youre telling us should we expect perhaps a stepdown in the first quarter due to day count and like you said the continuation of data creep but then would there be stability from there or an opportunity for reprice if the fed cuts im trying to just triangulate your comments on nim which are very helpful to the nii quarterly cadence david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we wont confirm your number exactly but your thinking is spot on that as we get to the end of the year we start stabilizing a bit and the question is where does the fed stop if they go one more time and stop then regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 the only thing you really have bleeding into the first quarter will be slight beta risk and the day count that you talked about so i think you have stability from thereon however if the fed continues to push this out even more and has to go two three two more hikes three more hikes and you just push everything out we do have hedges that are becoming live this quarter you can see that on our page in our deck and so we put those on over a year ago with anticipation that there was risk that rates actually roll over start going down they didnt and so well be in a bit of a negative carry on those which is okay because the rest of our book is earning a whole lot more money than we thought at the time so thats all been factored in to the guidance that we gave you and right now were expecting that we get to the end of the year and things really start to settle out with exception of minor tweaks in that first quarter erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and could you remind us sort of how much in total the check fraud you should have in your expense base for and as we think about your natural indiscernible run rate david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so we have a schedule on our supplement on it let me flip see if i can find it real quick for you because we were anticipating this question we wanted to give everybody an understanding its on page of the supplement and its embedded in the operational loss number and that change related to check fraud was about million as we mentioned in the call but you could see our operational losses had averaged about million to million per quarter and we are back to that kind of run rate now and so we expect to be there about that number going forward erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and if i could just squeeze one more in and this is for john were sitting here now july and your firm is in a position of great strength im wondering and im asking about organic opportunities dont think im wrapping an ma question around this but as you think about indiscernible on more stringent rwa diet than you given where your capital is today how are you thinking about playing offense as we think through indiscernible how do you leverage that deposit base that will stay inexpensive and the capital that seems to be building nicely and the credit that seems relatively stable john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp erika were continuing to add talent so were continuing to hire talent were in some very good markets we have acquired a number of capabilities over the last number of years and so its really combining talent with opportunity and markets with additional capabilities we just execute our plan were asking our bankers to be active in markets talking to customers and noncustomers looking for ways to expand our business and while there is still some economic uncertainty and we want to be prudent and careful we start with soundness first followed by profitability and then growth we think we are in a position as you pointed out to win market share where opportunities exist and we are focused on those prospects that weve been calling on for a regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 long time and relationships that weve had for a long time to ensure that we use the capital and the resources we have to support those companies as they want to grow their businesses david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah erika this is david let me add to that so we do realize there could be opportunities for us to grow loans faster than what we just gave you the guidance on so we gave you guidance of to weve reduced that slightly because of the demand that i had talked about earlier we want to grow relationships we arent interested in taking advantage of somebodys rwa diet and growing loans only we cannot outstrip our funding base because that marginal profitability just wont be there if youre having to wholesale fund that growth so if we can get a relationship to bring say an operating account and other deposits were all over that but were not interested in just growing loans because somebody else wants to shed that risk erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please proceed with your question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial

officer regions financial corp thats correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then your strategy for the securities portfolio in general are you going to be adding to it over time or what are you doing with the excess deposit growth that you got thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so weve historically been to of our earning assets on securities we suspect well be roughly in that range we have to think through is what the new regime will be with regards to aoci as youre probably aware the aoci changes with regards to securities becomes part of your capital but the fair market value changes with regards to derivatives is not and so what that does is it causes you to at least think about if we need the duration protection that we use our securities book for along with liquidity that perhaps we use more derivatives than securities and well just have to see but i dont see that changing our securities book appreciably will it be down a notch or two perhaps but i dont think you would you should expect us to grow that book much past that range betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you operator our final question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please proceed with your question john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning

corp good morning regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the deposit beta i know you indicated the potential for an increase in indiscernible any way to help us indiscernible that look likely if we are in a higher for longer environment or could it be up there where some of your competitors are flagging in the mid and maybe even up there in the where some of them are at just curious if you can help us frame it out thanks deron smithy a executive vice president treasurer regions financial corp hey john this is deron smithy ill take that one so i think youre in the right neighborhood our expectations would be that if the fed is indeed done over the next couple of meetings what youre seeing is just that residual beta creep but that plays out over a couple of quarters and then you have very modest increases from there it obviously depends on how long were at that level but i think somewhere in the upper to around is reasonable in terms of how much it may continue to move john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it deron no thats helpful indiscernible that and then separately just back on that oconnors question on the systems conversion can you remind us of your expectation around the cost of the conversion i know you had originally indicated that you dont expect it to impact your it budget is that still the case or has it has that changed as you have landed on the vendor etcetera thanks david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions financial corp yeah so john were still in the formative stage of planning for that ill tell you theres a lot of things going on other than this the system integration with regards to technology the environment is changing to software as a service versus buying a system and capitalizing it and depreciating that over time and skipping several of the upgrades because you dont want to pay for that today its all going in the cloud its paying by the drink and thats more expensive and its so technology cost used to be technology costs go down over time that does not appear to be the case we are going to do our best to control that while making appropriate investments in technology because i think we can leverage that better than we do today we use a lot of human capital to do things i think over time youre going to see most everybody leveraging technology better and so i think that right now were at to of total revenue i can see that drifting higher a bit over time but right now thats our call of to and well update you as things change john pancari q analyst evercore isi and then to is the total it budget david jackson turner jr a senior executive vice president chief financial officer regions
