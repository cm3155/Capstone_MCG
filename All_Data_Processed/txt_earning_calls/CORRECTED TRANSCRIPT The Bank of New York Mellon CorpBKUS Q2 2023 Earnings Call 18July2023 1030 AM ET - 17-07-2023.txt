yearoveryear consistent with our focus on driving pretax margin expansion in and beyond we drove meaningful positive operating leverage as we maintained strong expense discipline while continuing to make significant investments to improve our growth trajectory and transform our operating model as a result our pretax margin improved to and we generated a return on tangible common equity of in the quarter as ive said many times before disciplined execution and consistent progress from milestone to milestone is the key to unlocking the financial opportunity inherent in our high quality franchise the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 while were conscious of the work ahead of us were pleased to see the momentum building across the company first were getting an increasingly firm grip on our expense base im proud of our people who are embracing the task of making bny mellon a more efficient and scalable company which gives me confidence in our ability to deliver tangible results in and beyond remember in january we committed to essentially cut expense growth in half this year roughly growth excluding notable items in compared to roughly excurrency in halfway through the year im pleased to report that were on track even a little ahead of our plans second the strength of our balance sheet the resiliency of our business model and our proactive balance sheet management continue to differentiate us with clients and create value for our shareholders net interest revenue and deposits were both bright spots in the quarter and the federal reserves bank stress test demonstrated our capacity to withstand an extreme stress scenario as a result of the test our preliminary stress capital buffer requirement remains at the regulatory floor of and while our overall approach to returning capital to shareholders remains unchanged we increased our quarterly common dividend by to starting this quarter third we remain laser focused on driving sustainably higher underlying growth across the firm weve talked before about the advantages of our business model businesses such as clearance and collateral management pershing depositary receipts corporate trust and treasury services offer us a breadth and diversification in comparison to traditional trust banks we saw strength in some of these differentiated businesses in the second quarter and new business pipelines are healthy across the board and importantly we continued pushing ahead with new innovative client solutions that we expect to become growth accelerators for the medium and long term less than two years after hiring employee number one pershing x is now live with wove our open architecture wealth management platform that addresses a major pain point in the advisory market by better integrating advisors core applications wove allows us to integrate some of the best solutions from around bny mellon including from our investment management business as well as from leading thirdparty fintechs our launch at pershings insite conference in june has garnered significant early enthusiasm from clients and industry influencers who see wove as a promising solution the client pipeline is growing nicely which we will report on more in the quarters ahead more broadly wove is a proof point of our ability to execute at speed we can deliver leading solutions quickly when we empower our people surround them with the expertise and tools that they need and drive forward with a product mindset leveraging our great platforms its also a reflection of the change in mindset we are cultivating here more commercially oriented with a greater sense of ownership and a greater focus on execution ill also call out treasury services which continues to innovate in areas like faster payments and banking as a service this quarter the business announced a strategic alliance with mobility capital finance or mocafi a blackfounded fintech whose mission is to enable underserved communities to access banking services this is just the latest example of how we are deploying our capabilities to advance financial inclusion in an innovative way now ive spoken in the past about the opportunity to do more things for our clients by connecting the dots for them through our 1bny mellon initiative and how were going to operationalize that to help us realize this potential and more broadly to sharpen our commercial focus and elevate the client experience across the firm in the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 may we welcomed cathinka wahlstrom as our first chief commercial officer and member of our executive committee in addition to taking on oversight responsibilities for global client management ive tasked cathinka to embed 1bny mellon into the operations of our company its important that we commercialize this opportunity through training by properly incentivizing our people to collaborate across the firm and by developing deliberate approaches to multiproduct solutions stepping back for a moment let me provide a few thoughts on the macro environment we acknowledge that the path of interest rates continued qt and elevated us treasury issuance activity carry meaningful uncertainties for the environment in the months ahead from our vantage point as the primary clearer of us treasuries and through touching roughly of the worlds investable assets our data tells us that more than half of recent tbill issuance has been absorbed by funds flowing out of the feds rrp but a good chunk of the balance has come from the banking system most of the money market fund demand for tbills has been concentrated at the very front end as funds have been less comfortable extending duration past the end of july ahead of an expected rate hike later this month and continued uncertainty on the path of rates thereafter were also not seeing much foreign demand as cross border flows into us treasuries of all maturities are negative and have been for some time together this is likely going to put some incremental pressure on domestic funding sources funds banks and corporates as well as state and local governments to absorb upcoming supply unless tbill prices cheapen materially from current levels for this reason we do expect some further pressure on deposit balances across the industry in the months ahead as you would expect we are positioning ourselves prudently given these uncertainties but see these flows as benefiting our broader cash ecosystem we manage over trillion worth of cash on behalf of clients across deposits money market funds repos and securities lending and were the biggest provider of collateral services globally as well with about trillion of triparty balances on our platform this trillion of relevance to money market flows allows us to retain a connection to the money when it moves around various short term investment alternatives and allows us to help our clients find the right solutions for their investment needs let me conclude my comments on a reflective note as ive acknowledged before strategy matters but execution and culture matter even more as we close the books on the second quarter were entering the back half of the year with good momentum and confidence in our ability to drive change by executing consistently and at pace over the past couple of years weve been able to attract highcaliber talent to upgrade multiple important roles across the company our existing team together with these new leaders are rising to the challenge of unlocking our potential and its clear to me that we have a tremendous opportunity in front of us by leveraging our unique combination of businesses our preeminent client franchise and the power of our culture and people im encouraged by the initial progress over the past couple of quarters and excited about what lies ahead with that over to you dermot dermot william mcdonogh chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thank you robin and good morning everyone let me start on page of the presentation with some additional details on our consolidated financial results in the second quarter the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 total revenue of billion was up yearoveryear net interest revenue was up yearoveryear primarily driven by higher interest rates partially offset by changes in balance sheet size and mix fee revenue was down driven by the sale of alcentra in the fourth quarter the mix of cumulative aum net inflows and lower fx revenue on the back of lower volumes and volatility partially offset by the abatement of money market fee waivers firmwide auca of trillion increased by yearoveryear this increase reflects the impact of higher market values client inflows and net new business assets under management of trillion decreased by yearoveryear the impact of lower market values driven by a yearoveryear decrease in the uk fixed income markets and the sale of alcentra was partially offset by cumulative net inflows over the last year and the favorable impact of a weaker us dollar investment and other revenue was million we continue to see strength in fixed income trading and positive seed capital results expenses were flat on a reported basis and up excluding notable items this was driven by higher investments and revenuerelated expenses and the impact of inflation partially offset by efficiency savings and the alcentra divestiture provision for credit losses was million in the quarter reflecting changes in the macroeconomic forecast resulting in higher reserves relating to commercial real estate largely offset by reserve releases related to financial institutions as robin mentioned earlier earnings per share were up yearoveryear or up excluding notable item pretax margin continued to improve to our return on tangible common equity improved to turning to capital and liquidity on page our regulatory capital ratios remained roughly unchanged the tier leverage ratio was down basis points quarteroverquarter primarily driven by an increase in average assets tier capital increased slightly driven by capital generated through earnings net of capital returned through buybacks and dividends the cet1 ratio was up basis points quarteroverquarter primarily reflecting higher cet1 capital as we said on our earnings call in april we tapered buybacks in the second quarter to maintain conservative buffers above our management targets being mindful of the uncertain environment overall we returned of earnings including approximately million of common dividend and approximately million of buybacks in the second quarter on a yeartodate basis we have returned of earnings the consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was an increase of percentage points compared with the prior quarter our consolidated net stable funding ratio which we are reporting publicly for the first time this quarter was well in excess of the regulatory requirements moving on to net interest revenue and further detail on the underlying balance sheet trends on page which i will describe in sequential terms net interest revenue of billion was down quarteroverquarter driven by deposit mix shift partially offset by higher interest rates overall deposit balances have remained elevated relative to our expectations as they increased sequentially on an average basis interestbearing deposits were up noninterestbearing deposits were down in line with our expectations average interest earning assets increased by quarteroverquarter underneath that cash and reverse repo was up loan balances were flat our investment securities portfolio was down turning to expenses on page expenses for the quarter were flat yearoveryear on a reported basis and up excluding notable items relating to litigation and severance as i mentioned earlier this reflects higher investments and revenuerelated expenses and the impact of inflation partially offset by efficiency savings and the alcentra divestiture to summarize we continue pushing forward with our multiyear investments to increase the growth trajectory of the firm and transform our operating model for greater scalability over time importantly the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 we remain focused on driving positive operating leverage and delivering continued pretax margin expansion as an example of the expense discipline that robin mentioned for the second quarter we selffunded the entirety of our incremental investment spend and importantly are on course to do the same for the full year turning to our business segments starting with securities services on page as i discuss the performance of our securities services and market and wealth services segments i will comment on the investment services fees for each line of business described in our earnings press release and the financial supplement securities services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear fee revenue was down within this investment services fees were flat fx revenue was down on the back of lower volatility and volume net interest revenue was up in asset servicing investment services fees were flat with healthy underlying growth from new and existing clients offset by lower client transaction activity reflecting the current market environment importantly strength in attractive market segments continued despite an industry slowdown for private markets and hedge fund launches we saw strong growth in our alts servicing business highsingledigit growth in both etf auca and number of funds serviced continued within issuer services investment service fees were up driven by our depositary receipts business here the impact of a large client corporate action in the current quarter was tempered by the absence of russiarelated client activity in the second quarter of last year next market and wealth services on page market and wealth services reported total revenue of billion up yearoveryear fee revenue was up net interest revenue increased by in pershing investment services fees were up the increase reflects the abatement of money market fee waivers and higher fees on sweep balances partially offset by lower transaction volumes consistent with the decline in us equity exchange volumes and the impact of lost business the net new assets number was a negative billion in the quarter reflecting the deconversion of a regional bank client that was acquired in may excluding the impact of this ongoing deconversion which we expect to weigh on our reported net new assets for several quarters net new assets grew at a midsingledigit annualized growth rate we remain confident in pershings underlying momentum and prospects importantly our continued investments to enhance pershings core platform as well as the business access to the strength and breadth of the whole company is being recognized by clients as a differentiator especially in the current market environment also as robin mentioned earlier wove is off to an excellent start in treasury services investment services fees decreased by reflecting higher earnings credits for noninterestbearing deposit balances and lower payment volumes partially offset by continued momentum across payment and liquidity solutions in clearance and collateral management investment services fees were up driven by us government clearance volumes reflecting elevated volatility and us treasury issuance following resolution of the debt ceiling we also saw healthy growth in collateral management fees as the largest truly global collateral manager we continue to increase market connectivity by expanding our triparty platform to include new markets trade types and collateral pools our average triparty collateral management balances increased by yearoveryear to trillion the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 turning to investment and wealth management on page investment and wealth management reported total revenue of million down yearoveryear fee revenue was down investment and other revenue was million in the quarter primarily reflecting seed capital gains and net interest revenue declined year overyear assets under management of trillion decreased by yearoveryear as i mentioned earlier this decrease largely reflects lower market values driven by the yearoveryear decrease in uk fixed income market and the alcentra divestiture partially offset by cumulative net inflows and the favorable impact of the weaker dollar in the quarter we saw billion of net outflows from longterm products as clients continue to derisk and rebalance their portfolios and despite competitive investment performance we saw billion of net outflows from cash in investment management revenue was down yearoveryear primarily reflecting the sale of alcentra and the mix of cumulative net inflows partially offset by improved seed capital results and lower money market fee waivers while in wealth management revenue decreased driven by lower net interest revenue and changes in product mix client assets of billion increased by yearoveryear reflecting higher market values and cumulative net inflows page shows the results of the other segment i will close with a few comments on our current financial outlook for the second half of the year number one our net interest revenue outlook for the full year remains unchanged for growth yearoveryear this is based on marketimplied forward interest rates towards the end of the quarter we are pleased with our net interest revenue trajectory and balance sheet management year todate but mindful that we are operating in a very uncertain environment with continued rate volatility a higher for longer rates market backdrop and uncertainty surrounding meaningful us treasury issuance in the coming months number two we are ahead of plan when it comes to executing on our efficiency efforts we remain focused on outperforming our target of expense growth excluding notable items for the full year and will work hard to drive this closer to in the coming months while we expect the operating environment to continue to weigh on fee growth relative to what we expected at the beginning of the year our progress on the expense side continues to give us confidence in our ability to deliver positive operating leverage this year number three we still expect to return of our earnings or more to our shareholders over the full year while continuing to position ourselves conservatively with respect to our capital levels considering the amount of operating uncertainty in conclusion i am pleased to report that the company continues to perform well against the backdrop of complex operating environment and we continue to execute with a great sense of urgency against our growth and efficiency initiatives with that operator can you please open the line for qa the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question will come from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my question dermot id love to robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning brennan brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning dermot id like to start with which you just touched on the unchanged nii outlook curious what youre seeing as far as deposit cost pressure weve begun to see that emerge there are peer firms of bank of new yorks that have flagged some upward pressure in the back book how is it that you are able to avoid these pressures and keep on your nii outlook that you had provided earlier dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp thanks for the question brennan and good morning everyone so i will accept the fact that the pressures are there but i think the team is doing a great job managing both sides of the balance sheet in a very dynamic environment so if we kind of look at the first half of the year i think were very pleased with where weve come out in the first half of the year and feel were on a very good footing for the back half of the year in january when we spoke to you we kind of gave a guidance of and that was with a midsingledigit decline in deposits over the course of the year if you reflect on the two quarters just behind us we had elevated deposits in q1 on the back of uncertainty around regional banks we had elevated deposits in q2 on debt ceiling which really speaks to the strength of our balance sheet and the strength of our franchise and clients looking to use us in times of uncertainty now when you look to the back half of the year and our average deposits in q2 were around billion up sequentially we do expect this growth to moderate in the back half of the year and we do expect declines in our balances as a result of the treasury issuance which i think is going to be announced in august in terms of what theyre going to do between bills and coupon payments and the interplay between qt rrp and bank reserves is something that were all watching carefully so we do expect our balances to go down to mid to highsingle digits from here but when we reflect back and do the bottomsup topdown and talk to clients and see whats happening in the marketplace we come back to the same place as where we started at the beginning of the year in terms of our overall feel good about the guidance of and specifically to your point on deposit costs look our client base unlike others is largely institutional and our betas are in the mid to high we feel our book is kind of we passed on the rate rises to our clients over the last years so we feel pretty good about where the book is we price competitively clients come to us not just for deposits they come for a broad range of goods and services and deposits are part of our overall product the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 mix so we feel very good about where the book is and where the cost is notwithstanding there are pressures given the higher for longer rate environment and people looking to optimize their net interest income so thats it brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc thats very helpful thanks dermot i appreciate that and so switching gears a little bit on the fee revenue side this was a pretty good outcome for you guys here this quarter how should we be thinking about jumping off into the next quarter is there anywhere in particular where you would flag some adjustments that we should be making to the baseline or is this a fair way to think about it dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so as it relates to fees brennan look i think when i look across the various businesses and the feedback that were getting from clients and when i talk to our teams our backlogs are good were winning our fair share of deals i have to say the enthusiasm and the energy of the team when they came back from the insite conference having launched the wove product gives us great optimism about the future and what we can do for our clients so overall i would say our backlog is good in a very uncertain environment were winning our share and our yet to be installed book of business in asset servicing is healthy and strong brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc excellent thanks for that color operator and our next question will come from alex blostein with goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi guys good morning thanks for the question just a quick followup first maybe around the deposit discussion so dermot if i hear you correctly no kind of catchup from the back book that you expect to see in your deposit pricing for the rest of the year but i guess if we look at the deposit beta over the course of this quarter it looks like it was pretty close to on a currencyadjusted basis maybe help us break down the deposit cost in us and nonus and maybe the type of what kind of deposit pressure and client conversations are you seeing in the kind of different regions dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so on the catch up alex i would say when we talked about this last quarter we kind of said our q1 results were kind of largely a little bit of the price lag there which we feel is largely behind us and that catchup has happened in q2 so overall i think we feel pretty good about the catchup cumulative betas are in the mid to high for dollars and look its reasonable to expect that they will continue to grind higher from here but i would say no meaningful change if you take the overall deposit book in total its largely a dollarbased book  and then split between euros and sterling and the betas for sterling and euros are roughly in the kind of to range and then ill just reiterate like the point and i think its a very important point the deposit book is largely the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 institutional sophisticated clients and weve really repriced our book quite efficiently over the last years and thats really the message id like to leave you with alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc makes sense thank you and then robin a question for you maybe a little bit more on the strategic side when we look at the investment management business at bny mellon therere some areas that one could maybe characterize as sort of subscale the organic growth has been muted and obviously margins is something you guys as previously said need to sort of work on so are there any strategic areas where you feel like you could address some of these issues by either divesting or adding scale to businesses that are subscale so just kind of thinking more holistically about that business in the context of bny mellon robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp yeah thanks for the question alex obviously this is an area a segment we spend a lot of time on just to remind you we did a series of strategic reviews all across the company going back over the course of the past nine months weve looked at every function weve looked at every business and we did spend a particular amount of time digging in to our investment and wealth management segment look in terms of im in particular if you think about it as part of the iwm segment two years ago that whole segment was a pretax margin segment theres no reason to think we couldnt get back there over time but there are a series of different things that we have set out to do ourselves and so the execution of all of thats going to be really important theres going to be a combination of improving top line what youd expect in terms of really focused on meeting client needs strong investment performance new products et cetera and also some of the desiloing and expense management thats really in there but the thing im going to call out to you which i really think of as the bny mellon superpower and i think everyone needs to have a superpower these days in investment management is our distribution and so thats a place where strategy for the whole company really meets strategy for investment management because if you step back from the way that we were organized investment management was its own silo in the company and frankly a bit landlocked over there in its silo but our distribution capabilities trillion worth of retail distribution as one example but obviously we have other distribution as well in the company on the institutional side was separately landlocked over in a different corner of the company so our plan here is really to lean in to what we think of as one of our superpowers distribution and then allow the business in this newly configured format to really be able to stretch its legs in this nonsiloed format and then go from there and we think that thats a good path forward alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thank you both robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and well take a question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i know we talked a lot about deposits but i did just want to drill down on how youre thinking about the life of the deposits and is that at all changed versus history and part of the reason for asking is just trying to understand if theres any impact on the securities portfolio as you put that deposit flow to work thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp when you say life of deposit betsy do you mean like tenor and duration of the deposit that stays with us just to clarify the question betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah what you are assuming the life of the deposit is because im expecting that drives how youre investing those deposits dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay so let me start like talking about the billion of average balance sheet that we have important point number one twothirds of those deposits are operational or what we call sticky here at bny mellon we dont classify between insured and uninsured we call it sticky and nonsticky so the vast majority of our deposits are with us because the clients are in our ecosystem for the longterm and need to have cash with us to execute their business so thats why we think about it in that way on the asset side of the balance sheet like i would like to go back months when we kind of made some strategic decisions about positioning for this rise in interest rates we took a view in terms of how we wanted to set up the balance sheet with a rapid increase in interest rates and so weve done a lot of work last year in terms of repositioning the portfolio in terms of higher for longer of our portfolio is in afs and a big part of that is of the portfolio is also fixed that has a weighted average maturity of about four years so think of about rolling off a quarter every year so if you take on the asset side the amount of money that we have in cash plus the amount thats rolling off from fixed to floating and the investment yield pickup of that is about basis points we feel when you look at both asset and liability together combined were really well positioned over the next months to months to manage through this rate environment betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and you would say that the deposits already reflect the rates that obviously have come through todate right the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp largely yes absolutely which is why cumulative betas are in the mid to high and we expect them to grind a little bit higher from here but we as ive said we pay our clients a competitive rate and they are sophisticated and they know what theyre doing betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah okay and then just a separate question on op risk rwa next week i guess were getting the basel iii end game rules and just wondering i know we dont have the final rule but im sure youve thought a lot about this our op risk rwa component thats being added to standardized maybe you can give us a sense as to how youre thinking through and how we should think through assessing your position when those rules come out next week thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so again look weve talked about this pretty much for the last months so just to kind of recap what weve said before based on what we know we expect operational risk rwas to be in the standardized approach and that will drive an increase in our standardized rwas based on our internal analysis we think that will have a smaller increase than what the qis has shown in the past and so we kind of feel like capital levels will be a little bit higher but we feel we will have the ability to adapt and live with whatever the outcome is but again its been delayed a couple of times so i think for us were just waiting to see and we will turn it around quickly and well communicate to you when we have something tangible to say betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks so much appreciate it robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks betsy operator and our next question will come from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning robin good morning dermot robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 so wanted to dig into noninterestbearing deposits theyre now firmly within your to guidance or target range your peers have offered more conservative guidance on nib deposit trends i know some of your businesses and your mix is pretty unique or idiosyncratic but i wanted to just better understand whats driving the resiliency in nib trends and your confidence level at that to range is still appropriate dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay thanks for the question steven let me again go back to my last call when it was at and i guess everybody on the call was looking to see why werent we guiding higher and we kind of said history has told us that through the cycle and the trough our history and our experience and we have data going back years and we look at that the history tells us we should be in the zip code so weve done a very much a bottomsup analysis looking at the history important point to make here is our mix of businesses today is a little bit more diversified than it was years ago premerger we have a more diversified range of business as you said we have corporate trust treasury services asset servicing clearance and collateral management and each of our clients in each of those business segments use us for different reasons and deposits behave in a slightly different way within each of those businesses and the mix between nib and ibs in those businesses varies and so that gives us a really good confidence level in terms of the diversified business model nature that we have so our internal analysis is kind of pretty solid and then we look at what industry is saying and what you analysts are writing about and we kind of take that into accommodation also what other people have guided and what our clients are telling us and we take all of that together and we kind of feel at the end of the day consistent with what weve said in the last two quarters is is the best we can give you in terms of through the cycle which importantly then feeds into our nii guidance of over the course of months so its important to remember its a 12month guidance as opposed to managing it quartertoquarter steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats really helpful and just for my followup encouraging to see the margin for securities services this quarter that said the iwm margin remains subdued running in the lowteens yeartodate i know robin you had talked about distribution being a big focus but what do you see as an achievable target versus that lowteens level youre running at today and how much of that margin improvement is contingent on the revenue opportunities like improved distribution versus efficiency gains robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so looking at the whole company the securities services margin was weve given previously the guidance and the target around getting that to were very pleased with the progress but theres no question that weve had some sort of easier tailwinds in the form of rates and we have to continue to get after this deliberate cost to serve and so i just put that as a footnote on the securities services point we are laser focused on continuing to drive that margin higher were not complacent about this at all just because it happens to be approaching our original target but look on investment management and this goes a little bit to the prior question two years ago this was a pretax margin segment so we look around the world we look at whats happened how has it come down the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 with the various causes some of which is obviously a little bit cyclical and our conclusion is we dont see any reason why we couldnt get back there but execution comes in a bunch of different pieces as i touched on before and we really have to get after that execution and i think for me this point about the superpower of distribution remembering that we are a diversified set of businesses at bny mellon and weve had these tremendous distribution capabilities which we have really not put alongside this investment management manufacturing capability as well as we could have and so thats a strategic change in the company and as we pursue that strategic change and it will take a little while that we think is going to have some important opportunity ill also call out the expenses ive talked to you before about the fact that one of the other problems with silos as well as not bringing all of our company to bear on problems is the fact that we have duplicate costs and investment management is a great example of this we have in our investment management central team additional expense that duplicates to the rest of the firm and we can find better ways of bringing those capabilities together to actually execute better so theres opportunity there as well so collectively were going to pursue all of these things its going to take us a couple of years realistically to see all of the benefit of all of this work but we feel reasonably optimistic about our path forward here and of course were going to continue to report it and well keep you updated as we go on the journey steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color thanks for taking my questions operator and our next question will come from glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello how are you robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp glenn glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi so the fednow platform is starting for interbank payments im assuming youre going to be playing a big role in this but im curious what you think the expected impact for the industry and for bk is like these things are usually good for expenses good for capital efficiency but bad for revenue but im just curious if you can tell us what you think robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so immediate payments which is the umbrella ill put both fednow which is the new service coming into production from the fed and also the clearing houses realtime payments rails that the whole immediate payments world does to us represent an interesting disruption opportunity in the ecosystem of payments because there hasnt been a ton of disruption over the course of the past sort of 20orso years and so when these evolutions occur we see that as an opportunity because weve been a bit underrepresented although were the seventh largest us dollar payments clearer we feel a bit underrepresented in some parts of the flows of that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 ecosystem so weve deliberately invested to be ready as a marketleading participant in the realtime immediate payments lets call it evolution so yes we think its important yes we think its an opportunity we were the first bank to do a test in the original rails weve seen good traction its still early days i think fednow will be a bit of an accelerant to this because it creates more awareness of realtime payments and it broadens out the overall sort of participation rate i think weve been very involved with them on this initiative and were trying to position our payments platform as rail agnostic and so clients of ours can come to us and say hey bny mellon i want to make a payment they dont need to care about is it going to be fednow or is it going to be the rtp rails how do they want to migrate away from checks how do they want to treat it a payment on the fed wire versus ach versus one of these new capabilities and remember we wrap them in new services so the ability to offer realtime request for payment bill pay capabilities the ability to wrap additional fraud services in this whole thing we think this will be quite an interesting evolution and to your point about volumes versus price one of the good things about being a disruptor when you dont have as big a share of some of the credit card flows and some of those other things which admittedly have a higher price on them we arent so we get the opportunity to bring this unconflicted approach and benefit from the upside frankly without sacrificing much on the other side glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi very interesting thank you for that separate but related i think you guys have done a very good job of taking that net interest income growth you expect this year offsetting a couple of percent expense growth and bringing that operating leverage im trying to think out loud the mid to highsingledigit expected deposit decline in the back half makes for a tougher full year so even with good expense control i guess my question is how much do you need more of those get clients to do more with bank of new york crossselling mentality to kick in to produce that operating leverage next year dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so look thats a kind of a crystal balltype question steven so i think its a bit too early for us to comment on therere three parts to the question its like 1bny mellon client franchise we go at it every single day with incredible intensity we want clients to do more with us across different parts of the firm and were really working hard at that the second point is expenses two quarters in were very pleased with where we are we like the forward in terms of how were executing and how the firm has set up to execute i would remind you like this time last year we conducted a bottomsup exercise where we took ideas across the company from all our team members around the world put a bit of investment dollars behind it digitization automation and eliminating manual processes and in the expenses flat quarteroverquarter youre beginning to see the dividends of that paying through and importantly in my prepared remarks i said that we funded the entirety of our investment plans for the second quarter from efficiency and we expect that to continue over the mediumterm and then nii well just prepare as we go and the outlook is uncertain but well manage through it the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp glenn ill add one thing to that which is as you look across our strategy we were very clear at the beginning of the year about what we wanted to achieve this year we set out these three points of our outlook our guidance for and of course the year is always going to evolve a little differently than you imagine it will right at the beginning of the year and weve certainly had a year like that this year where weve had unexpected things happening in all corners of financial markets and so what we have done is weve really stuck very deliberately to our medium term plan and weve not allowed ourselves while we manage every quarter of course very deliberately every individual thing that were doing every day generating more fees focused on nii focused on expenses what were really doing is preparing our company for this medium and longer term journey of delivery and achieving our objectives and so there are always going to be a little bit of pluses and minuses in the quarter but we really think that that sort of broader strategy is what were about just deliberately executing and bringing the culture to bear so i hear you on the next couple of quarters but i would just continually remind you and put you back to that guidance that dermot mentioned about what were trying to do this year glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi ill leave there thanks operator and we have a question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just had a followup dermot robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc on the nii side so heard everything that youve talked about youve done a good job in terms of forecasting nii and depositor behavior give us a sense of if we dont get any rate cuts over the next months where does nii trough given the repricing on the security side that you expect and assuming no big surprises on deposits relative to your current expectations just is there a natural trough to nii without before we bake into it any fed moves dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so look the path of its a difficult question the path of interest rate matters yeah level of rates timing if you look at the last eight months the market broadly speaking hasnt got it right relative to fed dots and has now come into line over the last several weeks i think the two things that im looking at are its pretty baked in that the fed will hike in july then you have jackson hole thats going to be a very important meeting and then what happens in november because if its one hike every two meetings between july and november is a long time and there will be a lot of data in that period and so if they pass on november its going to be very hard for them to restart again so i think when we look at our balance sheet we positioned it higher for longer and that the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 kind of has informed our guidance of for this year and the book over the next months to months were broadly neutral on the outcome for rates up a little bit or rates down a little bit and thats kind of how we think about it ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just one followup maybe robin you made efficiency improvement a huge focus for the last year or two and as we think about it and without sort of asking you for guidance into next year as we think about these efficiency benefits to the bottom line should we think about it in increments much like you achieved it this year or should we expect a larger move at some point as you had the time to assess operations and maybe we see something larger next year or so robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp its an important question ebrahim and im going to frame it slightly differently to you which is we have focused on things that are going to be relatively quick wins associated with cleaning things up that we thought were inefficient and weve also laid out for ourselves a series of medium term things and a series of long term things and so we have a variety of initiatives in each of those buckets of course weve been executing on them in parallel but youve only seen the benefits of some of the shorter term things right now so dermot gave you the example of the ideas that our people generated and were going after those and we said those were sort of a threeyear or so implementation to get after that weve talked about the fact that we did some work some de layering in the organization at the end of last year into the beginning of this year which has been quite helpful thats also been a slightly shorter term thing at the same time were looking very deliberately and remembering that we are essentially a diversified financial services company because of all of these different businesses that we have and we have a lot of embedded platforms within that platforms that have been operated in sort of nonplatform ways as a result of our sort of slightly siloed past so now were getting after organizing those things a little bit differently and as we organize that therell be some expense benefit from that but also then having organized them in that way we get to really deliberately go after the duplication of systems and processes that are inside the company and thats also when we really get to go after the digitization so its harvesting a little bit for the short term focused on the things that we think make the company a wellrun company organizing ourselves to be able to structurally operate ourselves as we think of the company and then harvesting the benefit of that so theres a oneyear story a two three four fiveyear story associated with doing all of those things but as with everything we have to execute it really well and we want our people to come along with us on that journey because a lot of this is change of behavior from how people have worked in the past which is why we have a strategy were laser focused on the execution and culture really matters ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for the color thank you operator and we have a question from ken usdin with jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 hey thanks good morning just a followup to your point about being able to beat that expense expectation for the year and in reaction to a little bit different outcome on the fees than initially expected i just wonder if you could just talk to us about both sides of that number one the beating on the expense side is that doing anything incremental in terms of either the severance effects or delaying investments or is it just the core and on the fee side im just wondering if you can kind of catalog for us which businesses have underperformed a little bit and do you have a better line of sight for a better rate of change for those going forward thanks dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp okay so ill take that on the expense side so like the guidance was okay so and thats kind of down from exnotables excurrency important point to kind of stress there and so then it really comes down to executing and operational excellence in everything that we do on all the points that robin made and i think the executive committee and the firm and the team coming together and seeing that it can be done in a different way and then executing on that if you double click into different businesses and lets take the market and wealth services segment for a second thats a segment that has a mid40 margin were growing that segment were investing in that segment were putting big budget dollars to work there and thats evidenced by our launch of wove if you go to our securities services segment that is about increasing our margin through the cycle to and within that were insanely focused on our cost to serve automation digitization serving our clients in a more differentiated way that brings down our cost to serve so it does mean different things to different businesses at different points in the cycle plus in the first instance its all about how we show up and how we execute on the fees i think generally we feel very good about our backlog we feel very good about the pipeline were winning our share of what the market has to offer and our clients like what we have to offer so on the forward we feel weve excellent momentum and were executing well with our clients ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks a lot robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks ken operator and moving on to brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks most of my questions have been asked and answered but maybe just a followon on the 1bny mellon initiative maybe on the revenue side of that it sounds like obviously theres a lot of low hanging fruit on the cost side that will run well over the next one to two years but on the revenue side of that i guess how would you just in a comparison perspective relative to expenses how would you cite the revenue potential for 1bny over the next couple years and if you can point to any one early example of crosssell traction the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure so let me brian im going to split this into two pieces so one is specifically on 1bny mellon which we think of as increasing wallet share with our clients being able to do more with existing clients also attract new clients of course to the platform and sort of dealing with this issue that the median client at bny mellon is a consumer of products from one of our businesses so that started as an initiative if i really look back to the very origin of it it was almost a bit of a movement so it was a hearttomind exercise around getting people focused on the fact that this was an opportunity and that was a good way to start we set ourselves targets for we exceeded them we set ourselves targets for by the way weve achieved at the half year mark of our full year sales targets for that initiative and at least of our sales force has made at least one referral so we feel good about the way that we started but as i mentioned in my prepared remarks actually kind of industrializing that embedding it into the way that we actually run all of our sales and relationship management groups all across the company thats the next critical phase of this and so thats when it becomes part of sales targets and part of the way in which we assess peoples performance and we incentivize them and we train them and to enable that we made an important new hire and i mentioned cathinka in my prepared remarks because we needed to put somebody and wrap up that strategy deeply in to how we actually operate the company so thats the specific 1bny mellon initiative we feel very good that that creates an underlying boost to whatever our growth would have been without that on the new business side in addition to that the point that i made earlier on about desiloing the company that has weve talked about that more through the lens of expenses but actually it has an equally important component in terms of growth and so were investing in growth in how we actually operate our existing businesses in addition to the new innovations that weve talked about like pershing x and outsourced trading and so ill give you a few examples of that let me give you one good classic example which is were a large clearing firm were known for having that as one of our businesses but we actually have two institutional clearing platforms at bny mellon one embedded in our clearance and collateral management business and one embedded in our pershing business and remember im talking about institutions here so this isnt including the wealth piece in pershing and it didnt make any sense because we had multiple platforms clients were confused we did it in different ways and so weve taken those two businesses and weve combined them and now we have one institutional clearing business at bny mellon were in the process of executing that change right now i can give you the same types of examples around the way that outsourced trading came into being which was originally landlocked inside investment management we took it out we aligned it next to our markets business we have another example of that with trading that we do for certain clients where we had multiple examples so we have a long list of things where we were operating kind of independently and part of our growth is by bringing those together yes we will get benefits in terms of efficiency but we expect more client business from it too brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thats fantastic color maybe if i could just finish up on the deposit one more on the deposit side for you dermot you mentioned that your pricing is already very good and youre not seeing a great deal of pressure on deposit costs other than the grind higher that you cited within the asset servicing segment specifically so the asset servicing part of securities services are you seeing a different dynamic there whereby clients are looking the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 to either shift out of nibs or look for better deposit pricing and then in those contracts that you have servicing contracts that you have do you have provisions for embedding sort of a level of revenue type of outcome depending on whether they pay via fee or compensating balance dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so look brian i think youre trying to do a read across so i think its not really appropriate for me to kind of get into the detail on any specific business because we aggregate up to the firm and we give you a firm view so i wouldnt say im not seeing anything within asset servicing as it relates to the mix of ibs and nibs that would cause me to think theres been an outlier change quarteroverquarter or something thats unusual and out of line with what we expected at the beginning of the year brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah fair enough thank you robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thanks brian operator and we have a question from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning gentlemen dermot robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc earlier robin pointed out that obviously theres going to be lot of treasury issuance in the second half of the year could you guys quantify the benefit or the monetary benefit that youll see from this type of issuance because youre the primary clearer of treasuries of course is there any way of quantifying that for us robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp well ill take that actually gerard so look when you look across all of our businesses we recognize that growth comes in lots of different forms our clients growing their wallet share with us we can have market appreciation we can have transaction balances the total addressable market can go up there are different ways in which we see opportunity and in the treasury market given the role that we play in the treasury market at the end of the day more treasuries is a benefit for us because there are more treasuries that get traded in the market there are more treasuries that need to get funded in the market there are more treasuries that get issued in the market so theres a broader set of benefits there and youve seen that as weve reported some of our results in clearance and collateral management which obviously has been a growing business now that business isnt the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 only about treasury its also about international clearance its about global triparty outside of the us so i dont want you to zero in and only think about that being driven by treasuries but clearly treasuries is a market we serve and so when there are more of them and more activity we regard that on average as good gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i appreciate that and then and dermot you were talking about the balance sheet and how the portfolios the securities portfolios are positioned going forward especially if were in a higher for longer rate environment what if we get surprised sometime in the spring of and the fed starts cutting rates how quickly can you reposition the portfolio for that or would you need to do that can you give us some color on the opposite of what everybody expects today of higher for longer dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so the kind of the quick answer is a large part of our portfolio is cash so reprices very quickly up or down so we kind of think of our balance sheet as broadly neutral so if they cut by basis points or basis points were okay i think also our cio has taken in a couple of a little bit of protection on nii for in terms of locking some of the gains in so i would say again to the question a little while ago were broadly neutral up or down over the next to months gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and then just if we were to move into this lower rate environment because your deposit betas are so high so far year to from the beginning to where we are today i would assume you would be able to cut rates pretty quickly deposit rates pretty quickly dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp symmetrical accurate gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great super dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp equally on the way down as on the way up yeah gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you operator and we have a question from rob wildhack with autonomous research the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp morning guys i wanted to go back to the theme of fees versus expenses and drill down a little bit into securities services and the margin in there i mean what portion of the margin improvement youre aiming for do you think will come from sheer expense discipline and then what portion do you think comes from all the fee opportunities that youre speaking to dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so im not too sure i would like to give guidance at that granular level of detail but what i would say is emily and roman are intensely focused on delivering a better costtoserve model than what weve done in the past and we want to give clients a better experience with respect to automation digitization and how we deliver our products to them and so that is an intent focus of the team also we feel we have were the worlds largest custodian were number one in a lot of different things in the securities services space and so we like our hands were winning our share as i said earlier our backlog is very strong and we have a good medium term opportunity set in front us that were looking to win and execute on our yettobe installed book of business is very healthy so i think were going after the two legs with equal intensity and both will deliver that margin of through the cycle very important this quarter we had a nice healthy pickup from the rate back up but as robin said in an answer to another question were just not relying on that we know we have a lot of work to do and were getting about it robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp thanks dermot and then just one more on pershing excluding the deconversion performed pretty well again in terms of net new assets can you speak to some of the drivers there remind us what the revenue impact is and how youre thinking about the pipeline for that business specifically dermot william mcdonogh a chief financial officer memberexecutive committee the bank of new york mellon corp so dont want to do a revenue outlook based on the deconversion because i dont think its right to talk about any single particular client but what i would say ex the deconversion over the quarter we had like growth pershing is a business thats grown really well over the last number of years were very competitive were number one top three in different things and so i would say the feedback from our conference in florida insite where we launched wove was really really good and robin spoke about this at length in terms of the appetite about wove so we kind of think over the next several quarters we like the business momentum we have a lot of stuff in the pipeline i think come october were going to have a couple of deals that were going to be able to talk to you about that are quite exciting and will make you feel pretty good robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research us lp okay appreciate the color thank you operator and our final question comes from the line of rajiv bhatia with morningstar the bank of new york mellon corp bk corrected transcript q2 earnings call 18jul2023 rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research ah good morning and thank you for taking my question just on that pershing business can you remind us how much of your revenue is from ria custody side and then can you talk about what youre seeing from a competitive standpoint goldman sachs seems to be expanding in this area envestnet has partnered with fnz sei has also made some moves here so curious how you see the competitive landscape evolving robin vince a president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp sure rajiv look we dont split out the ria versus the brokerdealer as you know were number one in broker dealer and were in the top three in ria so were clearly a market leader its interesting the names that you picked because none of them are in the top three on either of those measures so having said that were obviously not complacent about newer entrants into the market or other people who want to sort of get into this this is a business that weve been in for a long time we understand it and we have scale im just going to repoint you to the trillion of assets on that platform that we think is gives us a tremendous starting point with clients and then the innovation that weve got in it so weve gone multicustody which is very important in that business were innovating a lot of our services traditionally have been focused on the investor but now were delivering to the advisor as well with the wove platform weve innovated into direct indexing capabilities financial planning capabilities tax aware investing capabilities were deploying bny mellon advisors and the capabilities from investment management because we have a trillion investment manager we have existing technology from our wealth management franchise which is marketleading and were adopting a 1bny mellon mindset to that so were taking that technology and delivering it through wove to other advisor clients so weve got this whole breadth to how were actually approaching this opportunity and while we of course welcome the competition from some of these other folks i dont think any of them can deliver that breadth of capability to our clients and so for advisors and investors we feel very good about our direction of travel in this business rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research thank you operator thank you and with that that does conclude our questionandanswer session for today i would now like to hand the call back over to robin with any additional or closing remarks robin vince president chief executive officer director the bank of new york mellon corp thank you operator and thank you everyone for your interest in bny mellon if you have any followup questions please reach out to marius and the ir team be well operator thank you this
