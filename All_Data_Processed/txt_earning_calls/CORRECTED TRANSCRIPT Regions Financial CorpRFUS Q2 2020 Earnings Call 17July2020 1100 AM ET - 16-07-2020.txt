relations section of our website these disclosures cover our presentation materials prepared comments as well as the qa segment of todays call and with that i will turn the call over to john john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you dana and thank you all for joining our call today over the last four months we have experienced tremendous disruption and uncertainty covered by both covid19 and overt examples of social inequality the impact on our customers communities and associates has been profound and the resulting operating environment has been challenging as our country works through the current health crisis and takes steps to address the systemic racial injustices that impact so many people in our society we remain focused on things that we can control were committed to supporting our associates our communities and our customers through these difficult times by providing much needed capital advice and guidance and financial support its incumbent on us to use our resources and expertise in ways that create positive change providing value to all stakeholders creates the foundation to deliver sustainable longterm performance the disruptive and uncertain operating environment has presented both opportunities and challenges in the second quarter we delivered million in adjusted pretax preprovision income this was regions highest ppi in over years and a reflection of our decadelong effort to optimize our balance sheet and improve risk adjusted returns while making strategic investments all to deliver sustainable performance and reduce variability in our revenue streams however while the core business performance was solid it was more than offset by an elevated provision caused by further deterioration in the economic outlook and the resulting impact on the risk ratings and credit quality just a few weeks ago while acknowledging that conditions were fragile i said we were cautiously optimistic about the prospect for economic recovery in our footprint regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 the southeast had fared better than other parts of the economy as evidenced by the fact that the unemployment rate in the majority of southeastern states had been better than the national average and the number of small businesses that closed within the region because of the crisis was also below the national average most of the states where we operate had reopened consumer deferral requests had begun to taper off and consumer spend continued to increase toward more normal levels so clearly there were some positive signs that we felt pretty good about however by the end of the quarter certain areas in our footprint began experiencing an acceleration in covid19 cases and some states paused or reversed their reopening plans the potential for a second wave of covid19 infections coupled with uncertainty surrounding the extension or renewal of various aid programs including the cares act has impacted our view on the potential pace of the recovery while we have experienced positive momentum over the latter part of the quarter much uncertainty remains and our provisioning reflects that as a result of this environment we recorded a second quarter credit loss provision of million the provision reflects adverse conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic outlook combined with downgrades in certain portfolios particularly energy restaurant retail and hotel as well as the impact of million of net chargeoffs this quarters provision also includes million related to the initial allowance for noncredit deteriorated loans acquired in the purchase of ascentium capital which closed on april we are committed to assisting our customers through this difficult time however we have not modified our rigorous credit review process and have continued to make riskrating adjustments as necessary in addition all business loans granted to deferral have been reviewed and risk ratings have been adjusted in accordance with our existing policies based upon the work weve done and our assumptions around the economic outlook we do not anticipate substantial reserve bills during the remainder of we know the economy will continue to experience stress as we combat the public health crisis however we spent a decade strengthening our capital position and credit risk management framework which have positioned as well to weather the economic downturn in the most recent round of supervisory stress test conducted by the federal reserve regions exceeded all minimum capital levels while we were pleased with our capital resiliency ph under stress we believe our industryleading hedging program which became effective in will provide additional support to pre provision net of revenue with respect to our common stock dividend the federal reserve has introduced an income test where the common dividend cannot exceed the average of the trailing four quarters net income management will recommend the board later next week that we maintain the dividend for the third quarter of we are committed to effectively managing our capital strength and organic growth generate sustainable long term value for our shareholders and continue lending activities to support customers and communities during the economic downturn that being said we must continue to focus on what we can control and remain committed to prudently managing expenses in the face of a challenging revenue environment thank you for your time and attention this morning with that ill now turn it over to david david jackson turner jr chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thank you john lets start with our quarterly highlights regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 second quarter results reflected a net loss available to common shareholders of million or per share items impacting our results for this quarter included a significant credit loss provision pandemicrelated expenses branch consolidation charges expenses associated with the purchase of our equipment finance business ascentium capital and a loss on early extinguishment of debt partially offsetting the negative adjustments was a favorable cva associated with customer derivatives as credit spreads improved significantly during the quarter as well as net interest income derived from newlyoriginated paycheck protection program loans in total we adjusted an additional selected item as highlighted on the slide reduced our pretax results by approximately million lets take a look at our results starting with the balance sheet adjusted average loans increased loan growth was driven primarily by elevated commercial draw activity the addition of billion in loans related to our equipment finance acquisition and billion average impact from newly originated paycheck protection program loans during the quarter looking ahead our focus remains on client selectivity and full relationships with appropriate risk adjusted returns commercial loan utilization levels normalized during the quarter as liquidity concerns have eased and corporate borrowers have access to the capital markets in addition corporate borrowers were generally feeling better about the economic outlook as the economy started to reopen although the recent rise in covid19 cases may temper that perspective with respect to ppp loans it remains difficult to predict the timing of loan forgiveness currently we anticipate forgiveness requests to begin in the third quarter and continue into the fourth we will have a better idea around timing once the forgiveness process begins adjusted average consumer loans increased to reflecting declines across all categories except mortgage which was up reflective of historically low market interest rates now turning to deposits deposit balances increased to record levels this quarter average deposits increased while ending deposits increased as many of our commercial customers have brought their excess deposits back to regions while also keeping their excess cash from line draws ppp loans and other government stimulus in their deposit accounts on an ending basis corporate segment deposits increased while wealth and consumer segment deposits increased and respectively these increases were partially offset by a decrease in wholesale broker deposits within the other segment although commercial line utilization rates have normalized corporate customers are using cash held outside of the bank to pay down line draws which continues to support elevated deposit levels we anticipate funds received through government stimulus and ppp will be spent by the end of the year and the remaining deposits will stay with us until interest rates begin to move higher similarly consumer deposits have continued to increased primarily due to government stimulus programs coupled with lower overall spend the delay in the tax filing deadline until july is also a contributor we anticipate consumer balances due to decline in the second half of the year as consumers make tax payments increase spending commensurate with improvement in the economy and the current round of federal unemployment benefits expire at the end of july lets shift to net interest income and margin which remain a strong story for regions net interest income increased linked quarter and as expected net interest margin decreased basis points to net interest income remains a source of stability for regions despite an extremely volatile market interest rate regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 backdrop linkedquarter our equipment finance acquisition elevated loan and deposit balances and our significant hedging program supported net interest income the decline in net interest margin was mostly attributable to elevated liquidity specifically elevated cash levels at the federal reserve and higher low spread loan balances associated with ppp account for approximately basis points of margin compression efforts to reduce these elevated cash levels are ongoing during the quarter million of early extinguishment of fhlb advances and a million bank debt tender directly reduced outstanding cash balances the implications of liquidity on net interest margin are expected to abate over the remainder of the year however the impact remains uncertain given the amount of liquidity in the system now that most of our forward starting hedges have begun and given our ability to move deposit cost lower our balance sheet was largely insulated from the decline in shortterm rates this quarter loan hedges added approximately million to net interest income and basis points to the margin the benefits from hedging will continue to increase as the majority of the remaining forward starting hedges begin in the third quarter current estimates for the third and fourth quarters have hedging benefits approximating million per quarter recall our hedges have roughly fiveyear tenors and a quarterend pretax market valuation of billion an important relative differentiator total deposit costs were basis points for the quarter representing a linkedquarter decline of basis points regions continues to deliver industryleading performance in this space exhibiting the strength of our deposit franchise over the coming quarters we expect deposit cost to further decline to historical lows lower longterm interest rates negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin during the quarter premium amortization increased million to million attributable in part to an unusually low first quarter furthermore the repricing of fixed rate loans and securities at lower market rates reduced net interest income and net interest margin by million and basis points respectively looking ahead to the third quarter let me start by saying the uncertainty surrounding the timing of forgiveness for ppp loans may create volatility in net interest income across quarters given the impacts from fee acceleration we currently anticipate nii to decline between and linkedquarter mostly from the normalization of line activity that was elevated in the second quarter excluding ppp and excess cash liquidity our core net interest margin is expected to stabilize in the mid to high now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense despite the challenging operating environment adjusted non interest income increased quarteroverquarter capital markets experienced a record quarter producing million of income excluding favorable cva capital markets income totaled million growth in capital markets was driven by record debt and equity underwriting as well as record fees generated from the placement of permanent financing for real estate customers in light of the current environment it is reasonable to expect capital markets to generate quarterly revenue excluding cva in the million to million range mortgage income increased driven primarily by record production volumes associated with the favorable rate environment lower interest rates have contributed to a significant increase in yearoveryear production in fact our fullyear production is expected to exceed full year levels by mortgage remains a core business for regions and our strategic decision to add a significant number of mortgage bankers last year is paying off closed mortgage loans in the month of may represent the highest single regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 month in our companys history and we continue to experience elevated application volumes throughout the quarter in addition mortgage servicing continues to be a strategic initiative during the quarter we initiated the new floor arrangement allowing us to grow the servicing portfolio after experiencing several quarters of net decline we expect mortgage to remain a strength in the consumer bank for the remainder of the year wealth management revenue declined driven primarily by lower investment services fee income which has been negatively impacted by reduced branch activity service charges revenue and card and atm fees decreased and respectively driven by lower customer spend activity consumer debit card spend has improved across the second quarter in fact the month of june transactions were up slightly yearoveryear while spend was up over yearoveryear consumer credit card spend has improved as well although june transaction levels were approximately below the prior year while spend was down the current environment has led to reduced overdrafts and credit card balances are lower quarteroverquarter looking forward if current spend levels persist we estimate consumer service charges and card and atm fees will be reduced by approximately million to million per month from premarch levels so despite elevated unemployment consumers appear to be holding up well they entered the pandemic in a position of strength and while spend levels are improving customers continue to delever while carefully managing their finances ramping up noninterest income market value is associated with certain employee benefit assets improved during the quarter resulting in a significant quarteroverquarter benefit while this increased noninterest income it was fully offset by corresponding increase in salaries and employee benefits expense lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses increased compared to the prior quarter salaries and benefits increased driven primarily by the liability impact associated with positive market value adjustments unemployed benefit accounts elevated productionbased incentives temporary covid pay increases the addition of approximately associates from our equipment finance acquisition as well as our annual merit increases also contributed to the increase professional fees increased driven primarily by legal fees associated with the completion of our acquisition fdic assessment increased attributable primarily to the effects of unfavorable economic conditions at higher assessment base and a reduction in unsecured bank debt in addition expenses associated with visa class b shares sold in a prior year increased to million the companys second quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was and the effective tax rate was we continue to benefit from continuous improvement processes as we have just completed over of the current list of identified initiatives for example excluding our equipment finance acquisition we have reduced total corporate space by almost square feet or since the second quarter of last year through the pandemic we have learned how to interact and communicate with customers and each other in new ways we have seen a dramatic increase in digital adoption and continue to have success through increased calling efforts using video conferencing our video conferencing accounts have increased by since mid march and yeartodate we have already surpassed the number of video conferencing sessions conducted in all of this is clear evidence our associates and customers are embracing alternatives to inperson meetings regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 in addition yearoveryear mobile deposits are up deposit accounts opened digitally are up and digital logins are up further almost half of our new digital users in have come from customers years and over in fact digital played a significant role in our ability to assist our customers in obtaining ppp loans during the pandemic approximately of applications were submitted online and were closed using esignature weve been actively reducing the size of our retail network for several years now in fact we consolidated branches this quarter because of increased digital adoption and changing customer preferences we expect branch consolidations to continue customers have an increasing desire for an omnichannel delivery model for their banking needs so while we consolidate branches we will continue to add new modern locations that are best suited to provide the advice and guidance our customers expect similarly we are evaluating our digital and technology spend priorities to best leverage the digital momentum we are experiencing this shift will allow us to focus on enhancing digital banking capabilities further advancing our digital sales capabilities and leveraging esignature to make banking easier for our customers we also believe there are additional opportunities where corporate space is concerned whether through increased use of hoteling workfromhome or modified scheduling were confident overall office square footage will continue to decline our expense number this quarter has a bit of noise in it and i want to spend a few minutes walking through if you start with our adjusted total expenses of million and back out unusual items we dont adjust for such as the expense associated with the employee benefit accounts and total covidrelated expenses it gets back to a core quarterly run rate inclusive of our equipment finance acquisition in the million to million range to be clear we remain committed to making the investments needed to grow our business however our overall expense base must always be reflective of the revenue environment so to the extent the revenue environment is challenged we will look for additional efficiency opportunities lets move on to asset quality the credit loss provision for the quarter totaled million the provision reflects adverse conditions and significant uncertainty within the economic outlook combined with downgrades in certain portfolios as well as the impact of million in net chargeoffs portfolio level downgrades were made primarily within energy restaurant hotel and retail while economic outlook uncertainty is centered primarily on the impact of unemployment and the benefits of government stimulus already enacted and the potential for additional stimulus this quarters provision also includes million establishing the initial allowance for the noncredit deteriorated small business loans acquired as part of our equipment finance acquisition which closed on april the resulting allowance for credit losses is of total loans and of total nonaccrual loans importantly excluding the fully guaranteed ppp loans our allowance for credit losses increases to of total loans annualized net chargeoffs were basis points this quarter the increase reflects charges taken within the energy and restaurant portfolios additionally for the first time our results now include chargeoffs related to our recent equipment finance acquisition these chargeoffs contributed to million decline in total nonperforming loans total delinquencies and troubled debt restructuring loans increased and respectively business services criticized loans increased despite our willingness to work with our customers during this difficult time we are not relaxing our credit policies and continue to revise risk ratings as necessary this approach as well as specific portfolio level downgrades led to significant increase in criticized loans we have regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 executed a bottomup approach to review all of our stressed business portfolios until this gives us good insight into potential loss and underlying stress over the second half of the year with respect to consumers they entered the pandemic in good shape in relation to jobs income loan to values et cetera they have clearly benefited from the government stimulus and recent momentum in the jobs numbers has been positive however resurgence of covid19 cases has slowed some reopenings and the expectation of certain federal benefits ending in july create some downside risk based on the work we have completed and what we know today we do not anticipate substantial reserve builds during the remainder of additionally we anticipate net chargeoff levels for the remainder of the year to be consistent with the second quarter in addition weve continued to refine our view of atrisk portfolios resulting from the pandemic through our engagement with customers and actual market observations gained through the quarter we have a more informed view of which sectors can withstand operations in this new normal as a result the portion of our portfolio we consider to be at the highest risk of potential loss due to the pandemic declined from billion at the end of last quarter to billion at june this amount includes loans acquired during the quarter from our equipment finance acquisition with respect to loan deferrals we will have better insight in the next few weeks as the initial deferral periods expire but we continue to see positive underlying trends as of july approximately of clients have made mortgage payments while in forbearance in the last days for home equity payments while in deferral have been credit card is at and autos at and approximately of our corporate banking clients in deferral have made a payment in the last days while we have modeled second business loan deferral request at approximately early trends indicate requests are tracking at less than for both commitments and relationships lets take a look at capital and liquidity our common equity tier ratio is estimated at in late june we received notice that the company exceeded all minimum capital levels out of the supervisory stress test our preliminary stress capital buffer for the fourth quarter of through the third quarter of is currently estimated at this represents the amount of capital degradation under the supervisory severely adverse scenario and is inclusive of four quarters of planned common stock dividends these results allow regions to manage capital in support of lending activities and focus on appropriate shareholder returns our current capital plan reflects a previously announced suspension of share repurchases through the end of with respect to the common stock dividend management will recommend to the board that the third quarter dividend remain at its current level looking ahead we expect to maintain the dividend however future payout capacity will be dependent on earnings over the second half of the year and any constraints imposed by the federal reserve also it is important to note that we have approximately billion of pretax security gains in oci that are not included in our regulatory capital numbers unlike advanced approach banks we exclude oci from our capital calculations but nonetheless it is available to absorb potential losses as previously noted we have an additional billion of pretax gains on our cash flow hedges in oci which is also excluded from regulatory capital terminating these hedges would not provide immediate recognition in income or capital as a gain would be deferred and amortized into income therefore supporting capital over the remaining life of the derivatives regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 these transactions are hedges designed to protect net income in a low rate environment we believe theres incremental value in leaving the hedges live based on the current forward fiveyear libor curve however we continue to evaluate and discuss positioning points this demonstrates significant additional loss absorbing capacity which is not reflected in our regulatory capital levels with respect to liquidity significant deposit growth during the quarter has contributed to historically elevated liquidity sources for the company deposits ended the quarter at record levels and contributed to a percentage point decline in our loantodeposit ratio to so in summary our robust capital and liquidity planning processes which are stressed internally as well as externally by our regulators are designed to ensure resilience and sustainability this gives us confidence that we can continue to meet the needs of our customers and communities during this exceptional period of economic uncertainty despite the uncertain environment we remain focused on helping our customers associates and communities navigate through this difficult time we have a solid strategic plan and are committed to its continued execution rest assured during this extraordinary time regions stands ready to help and support all stakeholders with that we are happy to take your questions considering the current environment we do ask that each of you ask only one question to allow for more questions and participants we will now open the line for your questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks very much david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi okay a couple of questions one just on the outlook here for net chargeoffs you highlighted flat in or so and i guess im just trying to understand how youre thinking about the trajectory from there is it that at this current run rate you feel like youre anticipating the nearterm impact on the portfolio or is it that you dont expect an uptick in net chargeoffs until things like stimulus roll off regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp its barb and ill go ahead and respond to that betsy its a couple of things one is weve done a deep dive on all of our portfolios virtually of our business services portfolio weve had conversations with the first line and credit together weve talked to customerbycustomer et cetera weve had ongoing discussions that some of them are happening weekly some of them monthly some of them biweekly et cetera so we really feel good about the information we have on which to look and say which customers may create an issue but we also made a change in our thinking over the since the last great recession which is we dont want let problems age so as we see a problem out there and we think it might head towards a chargeoff we are actually moving it towards chargeoff hoping well get a recovery in due course that recovery is going to be much further out so as we think about getting to and thats part of whats in the second half thinking as we get to the beginning of next year what we anticipate is that on our business services side the commercial part of the book that those numbers will indeed come down and consumer is a bit of the wild card because youre right once the deferments roll off and the stimulus rolls off how will they behave but so far im pretty encouraged by what i see relative to people asking for things like second deferrals et cetera early on but still encouraged somewhat on that front betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thats helpful color i noticed yes the ncos were up a little bit qonq more than what weve seen out of other institutions so that reflects your more proactive stance i guess with moving people into the npls maybe you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah and betsy just to correlate that you see a little decline in nonperforming loans quarteroverquarter which i think is again a reflection of the fact that were moving those chargeoffs through the system betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah exactly okay followup question just on the outlook for nii guide down to in qonq could you just give us some color around the inputs to that with regard to what youre thinking about for average earning asset growth versus the nim and then i know with the hedges your core nim is mid to high youve got some benefit from ppp at some point through the next couple of quarters as well so maybe you can give us some sense of the trajectory for the main pieces into and then as we look for ppp how we should anticipate that flow through from here thanks david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah theres a lot in there let me see if i can boil it down so what we dont know is what the regime is going to be on forgiveness of ppp so we dont have anything meaningful really coming through other than the carry that we are getting which is pretty low carry probably the biggest driver is reduction in the loan book that we see there were a lot of draws that happened in the late first quarter and in the second quarter we saw about of those be repaid by the end of the second quarter but theres still some more that are going to be coming through and so i think its reflective of that continued decline in loans regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 the other is so our deposits were up some a big part of that we believe is also driven by the fact that the tax payment date was moved to july and so we should expect a runoff of deposits in the quarter and therefore using some assets from that standpoint so when you kind of add all that up were going to have premium amortization in terms of prepayment so we had talked about that being up in the million range this quarter thats probably going to be close to the upper this next quarter as we see prepayments increase and then weve talked about the reinvestment of cash flows from fixed rate loans and securities that have to go on the books at prevailing rates that component of it cost us billion this past quarter and thats harder to hedge out so were fully protected on the shortterm moves but we still have some exposure to the reinvestment piece so you add all that up and thats where that decline in nii is coming from betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc ph super david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp betsy i should also point out that the benefit from our hedges in the first quarter were about million what we saw this quarter was about million and the benefit well see in the third quarter assuming rates are in the third quarter and beyond all the way for five years is about million so the hedges were very thankful that we have those and thats a big part of us keeping the stability of our nii and resulting core margin betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and so then i know you dont have anything in your numbers for or your guidance obviously for ppp but as those loans are forgiven you get a temporary uptick in your nii and so youre just going to treat that as a kind of a oneoff is that how we should be thinking about it david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well again it depends on what the regime is if we end up having an unusual bump in any given quarter well point that out so that investors understand that if it comes in over time and its just kind of part of our business maybe we wouldnt but right now its just so we dont know what the regime is going to be and when we get further guidance on that well tell everybody and reforecast for you ronald g smith a senior executive vice president head of corporate banking group regions bank david this is ronnie smith betsy just to reiterate there has been an extension from the initial eightweek period that businesses were able to count the funds that qualified for uses under ppp so that weeks has pushed that out a bit depending on which process the customer select betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay all right thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you betsy operator your next question is from ken usdin of jefferies john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hi ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks hey good morning everyone obviously with the big reserve this quarter the cet1 ratio slipped a little bit below the zone where you talked about being comfortable and i just wanted to ask you to kind of flesh that out visàvis your other comments about continuing to recommend the dividend the back and forth between comfort on where your ratios sit where do you think that cet1 can get back to and then put that in context of the income constraint and how you think about that too thanks david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp sure so i assume everybody is looking at the slide where we have our waterfall and you could see the positive contribution generated from our core engine our ppr and then the impact of the dividend so between those two is basis points to the plus we did have provision expense that drove that down as well as our acquisition of ascentium in the first quarter so i think wed all acknowledge were in some form of stress in the country and weve always said our mathematical calculation would lead us to desiring a common equity tier of we were holding a little excess capital to take advantage of opportunities which one occurred ascentium and so you should expect as you look at that waterfall chart and again we dont expect to have a provision at the level we just had so we could accrete that capital back pretty quickly while we also have pretty robust reserves if you look at our coverage distressed losses now so we couldnt pick the timing of when that particular transaction hit we went to were comfortable where we are the dividend is not a capital adequacy issue you can glean that from the dfast analysis that came through now we are going through some form of a stress test in the fourth quarter and were not sure exactly what that regime is going to look like what we do know is that we have for the third quarter the dividend limitation on the past four quarters based on our math as we mentioned in the prepared remarks well be recommending to our board to sustain the dividend in the third quarter as we think about the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year we dont know if that regime will continue we have to suspect that it might and therefore we gave you guidance that we believe our dividend is sustainable going out into the fourth quarter and into the first quarter based on our expectations of forecasted earnings regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 that being said the two caveats are lets see what the economy looks like when we prepare the financial statements for september and well make whatever adjustments are necessary and then whatever the federal reserve and supervisors may do in this fourth quarter analysis we dont know so those are the two caveats so based on what we could see we feel good about sustaining the dividend john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you ken operator our next question is from stephen scouten of piper sandler john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning yeah i was wondering if you guys could give a little more color around the loan deferrals i know you said your expectations for second deferrals are maybe youre tracking under and im also kind of wondering how much of those maybe deferred loans that are still performing were downgraded from a rating perspective because it feels like you guys are ahead of your peers in terms of changing risk ratings but i want to see if you can frame that up for us a little bit john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp barb do you want to speak to that barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp sure yes so as we talked about deferrals in general begin with let me ill start with consumer work my way to business services really quick stephen and so for consumer what we saw is that deferral rate allin in fact for the company is about what i was looking at in fact earlier this morning is that those numbers are in fact coming down and so far in consumer weve had no requests for a second deferral yet mind you its early and some of the first deferrals are just rolling off but its still a good encouraging early sign for the business services portfolio allin its about as well and again talking to our customers of again the benefit of these onebyone conversations weve heard very limited need for a second deferral so again very encouraging news from that front relative to those that are deferred and the percent that are criticized within those weve given a chart on page but doesnt give the criticized portion of the deferrals but you can intuit from that the criticized a large portion of those criticized percentages were do include a deferral john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp ronnie smith do you want to talk about the wholesale book regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 ronald g smith a senior executive vice president head of corporate banking group regions bank yeah john just from just numbers if i step back into it stephen we have clients in the wholesale book that have requested deferral and out of that particular universe we are seeing and i think david said this in his opening comments but were seeing a very low request for a second deferral period and we are using that though as a leading indicator to go in and provide a scrub on a namebyname basis to appropriately assign risk ratings to those clients who had requested a deferral were finding as you can tell in the early returns and i want to stress its early less than of those requesting a second deferral period and so that shows the strength of cash flows liquidity that they have built up and so we feel good about where we are at this point but theres a lot more deferrals that need to mature as we continue to work with each of these clients stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay very very helpful if i could ask david one clarifier on the expense guidance information you gave you said million to million is kind of a better longer term run rate maybe when do you think you can get to that level and what level of kind of ppp related expenses are within that number if you have any guidance there john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah so we think we can get there now its just this past quarter i acknowledged theres a lot of noise in our numbers and thats why we actually gave you a little better guidance to what to expect going forward we had some expenses that came through ppp that werent particularly material in any of those that were related to loan originations are deferred as part of the fees that we get and would be amortized over the life of the loan so i wouldnt expect anything material from that standpoint to hit us in the third quarter and going forward stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great thanks for the color appreciate the time john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matt hi regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i know you guys touched on this a little bit but coming back to credit id say its an interesting day because your stock is getting hit because folks think you have worse credit because you reserve for more another company came out today and it was taken from ph heed for maybe underreserving so from an outside point of view its a little hard to tell like whos being aggressive whos maybe behind and i guess from your point of view like why do you think you are able to kind of be more aggressive than maybe some others is it the loan mix is it just the data that you have as youve mentioned has changed quite a bit in your markets the last six weeks is it the pain that you live through in the last downturn just anything else you could add on that thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah it is only i think last quarter we were criticized for potentially underreserving and this quarter there are some questions about credit and i think i cant speak to what other banks are doing what i do know is what were doing over the last years we worked really hard to improve our credit risk management processes and as ronnie and barb described on the wholesale side of our business weve been through the large majority if not all of our portfolios highrisk portfolios large exposures and we have risk credit those credits we think appropriately and as a result our allowance for credit losses reflects those risk ratings weve considered companies industries their ability to repay and were actively monitoring our portfolios and so have presented what we believe to be an appropriate allowance given the risk thats currently in our portfolio based upon the economic assumptions were applying and expected life of loan losses and its our anticipation that the portfolio will as david has described performed consistent with in the future at least next two quarters will chargeoffs will approximate where the current levels and we dont anticipate any significant additional provisioning if there are no changes in the economic environment and if our credit quality doesnt further deteriorate because of changes in the economic environment john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah matt were trying to help everybody on our page showing the allowance waterfall and you can see the economic outlook component of million that was added to the reserve and thats a reflection of the primary driver for this is unemployment so when we were at the first quarter our expectation of unemployment was closer to today its thats a big delta and the question is how quick is the recovery going to be whats the impact of the stimulus so theres a lot of work that goes into ultimately determining what the allowance needs to be we are risk rating and barb may want to chime in on this risk rating and relative to what we see in the book from the groundup process that was earlier described and thats the million that you see in the middle of that page now remember on top of that is the chargeoff number of about million so if you add to that its about million of our million provision so barb you want to talk about the risk rating john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 well i think weve covered that the point id make is though that there is its hard to distinguish between deterioration and the credit portfolio and changes in the economic environment because one effectively negates the other david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp i think it visually represents what is just overall our assumptions based upon the current stress environment that were in matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right that was helpful thanks for going through that again operator your next question is from peter winter of wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc hi good morning john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hi peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning i was just wondering when i look at the dfast results it seemed like they werent as strong as they should have been on ppnr and is there anything that the fed is missing or anything that you can do to address that with the fed especially when it comes to the stress capitals ph out there david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp so peter we as we laid out in our prepared comments we have a unique benefit of our forwardstarting hedges that we had put in place a couple of years ago but they didnt become effective until the first quarter of this year for a piece of them the second quarter had another piece and then the third quarter theres one more stepup and you can see that in the chart that weve put in the slide deck because that benefit wasnt in our run rate we dont believe we got the full benefit of that in our ppnr estimation in that last dfast as a matter of fact our ppnr which we believe should outperform our peer group in that test so it was in the middle of the peer it was a median part of the peer group so were in having discussions on how that can be reviewed by them differently obviously were going to go through some form of a stress test this fourth quarter they will have the knowledge obviously of our derivatives and how they come in to protect our ppnr in the stressful times especially in a lowrate environment so lets see what happens as they continue to regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 evaluate both the scb so its a preliminary scb the final wont be out till august and then on top of that well have the fourth quarter stress test of some type peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc all right thanks john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator the next question is from jennifer demba of suntrust john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning a question on deposit service charges they were million in second quarter down from million what kind of run rate are we looking at for that line item in future quarters and how much of fee waivers are coming back in david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah jennifer so we tried to give a little bit of guidance so let me roll it forward from the first quarter if you recall spend was down quite a bit on the consumer side and that we were concerned if that stayed at that level it was going to cost us about million a month between service charges in card and atm fees in our prepared comments because of the spend coming back in particular on debit card usage that number is down to million to million per month at this current level now in the month of june we started to see that pick up a bit but still not to the level that we had seen precrisis a big driver of that is the amount of stimulus thats still sitting in the deposit accounts of our customers therefore you dont have ph nsf fees for instance coming through and you dont have a credit card interchange coming through so right now were guiding to million million to million per month from the premarch numbers that you really ought to think through as you model jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks so much john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 operator your next question is from saul martinez of ubs john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning saul saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning hey i wanted to go through the dividend math a little bit in a little bit more detail and i know you guys said based on your best estimates and realizing theres a lot of uncertainty here you should be able to pay your dividend but if the fed does extend the dividend cap into the fourth quarter by my calculation you guys would have to do about million of the net income for preferreds in the third quarter to keep your dividend at a share and if its extended into next year then thats just even more difficult as rolls off because presumably that goes up closer to million so i guess what i want to get a better sense for is that when you say that youre confident in meeting your dividends are you basically saying that youre confident that youll be able to meet that kind of net income threshold over the next couple of quarters david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp thats what were saying saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thats good ill be respectful of the one question rule so thank you david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp okay john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you saul operator your next question is from dave rochester of compass point david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 hey given all the work you guys have done with the more atrisk book and those credits under stress which drove a lot of these downgrades and the quantitative reserve builds you guys have here was just wondering what the reserve ratio is that you have on that atrisk book or what youre seeing as the overall potential loss content there barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah this is barb and right now we would have a reserve ratio on that atrisk book of about a little over and then if you look at some of the subsectors energy as an example of the high risk segments that we point out at to give you a sense restaurants over so we think we have a pretty healthy reserve on it david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great all right thanks guys appreciate it john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning i just want to followup on some points that barb was making earlier so given the changes on the business criticized and the reserve build this quarter what has to change to see if that further deteriorate do you feel like youre ahead of that with the changes that you made this quarter barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah i would say were certainly on top of it and of course the indiscernible as we all know is whats going to happen in the economy so our best view of the economy is whats incorporated into what our thinking is if all of a sudden we get a second wave that comes in and it closes everything down theres going to be some more pain but based on what we know today im back to yeah im really confident on it as ive said weve gone through weve had the discussions theyre not a oneanddone discussion they are an ongoing discussion we have these meetings set up with ronnies team again and we have them all in there we have credit in there we spend hours going through it so again that gets back to giving me that level of confidence that theres nothing thats happening that were not talking about or seeing and more importantly reflecting in our thoughts around what are we going to call a criticized loan or a classified loan an npl or a chargeoff for that matter regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i think the other caveat is we really the level of federal government relief is unprecedented and it is very difficult for us to apply any sort of modeling to that and so depending upon whether the relief is extended or not what that looks like certainly is a factor as we look forward but that of course would influence i think that the economic conditions that were currently assuming as well so it is an unusual time but as barb said we feel like were on top of our reserving and credit issues barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp absolutely christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for the additional color appreciate it john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah thank you operator the next question is from vivek juneja of jpmorgan john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp vivek good morning vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi morning thank you just a couple of clarifications around credit you mentioned i think david mentioned no more reserve build david am i to presume that your and at the same time you gave a guidance for net charge offs to remain at secondquarter levels so two elements to that where are you expecting chargeoffs where is the in your line of sight that youve given this guidance youre obviously expecting chargeoffs in some categories which are those and then to your reserve point related to that david are you expecting provisions will at least match chargeoffs are you presuming reserves to indiscernible going to start to come down so youre not starting to release reserves yet right david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp well let me start with your back part of the question and then barb will answer the first part so the way cecl works is were supposed to reserve for all losses in the portfolio at the balance sheet date based on all the factors that we can observe economic indicators and the like and so if we do that right and portfolio the economy doesnt change theres no degradation in the credit metrics loans arent growing then you wouldnt expect to have provision you cant have provision necessarily equal to chargeoffs its kind of whatever it takes to get the reserve to the level it needs to be at at the balance sheet date regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 so right now we think we have it all but as we did in the first quarter the caveat we gave you then were going to give it to you now we dont know what the economy is going to look like at september but based on what we do know even subsequent to closing of the books the economy hadnt degraded materially from where we were when we set the reserve so were feeling better about that going into the third quarter which was different than going into the second so barb you want to answer the indiscernible barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah first part of the question which is where are the chargeoffs going to come from in our estimation based on the analysis that weve done the conversations that weve had again primarily from the two portfolios weve already talked about energy and restaurant we have to see the rest of that play out theres going to be some retail and some hotel that could impact as well but thats generally what i would size it up to vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you vivek operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john how are you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good thank you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc ive got some questions on the forbearance part of the portfolio ones a technical question on are you accruing all the interest for those loans even though the customers that may not be paying versus the ones that are paying and then the second part of the question is have you had any conversations with the fed on when they may go back to their more traditional stance on forbearance and on how banks have to carry the higher capital levels against those loans regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 and then the third part of the question is once you go off forbearance the fed says it ends with say second quarter of and you still got loans on forbearance will they immediately start going into a nonperforming status meaning being meaning days past due or will you just immediately put them into nonaccrual because theyve already been in forbearance david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp gerard this is david ill start with the first part so when loans go into forbearance we still accrue interest unless that loan was already on nonaccrual status or it had it didnt have the ability to pay all of its principal and net contractual principal and interest in which case any payments that we were to receive we actually write down the principal balance thats our accounting policy so for the most part this type of forbearance that youre seeing you can see the performance where people are still making their payments but even if theyre not and theyre not on nonaccrual we are in fact accruing interest on those do you want to talk about the second part john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp the second part of the question is weve not had any conversations with the fed about when they may change their guidance about how we work with customers in respect to the coronavirus and their initial guidance gave examples including sixmonth periods of forbearance as examples of how we might consider working with customers and we really havent had any guidance since then the third part of your question i think was hypothetically what do we do if we get out months months and a customer still cant pay and barb do you want to talk about that barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah i dont see a cliff at that point in time because what were doing is with the process we have in place right now is were taking all of that information we have in place today the customers on deferral thats one input point were looking at their cash flows were looking at a lot of other things to make the determination on the risk rating which is why youre going to see customers who are paying that we may have sitting in the nonperforming loan category or move to a criticized or classified category so we are making those risk rating changes not because of the deferral but as i said deferrals simply a point so i dont see a huge cliff on any of that john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp and barb were using the deferral as a leading indicator to go dig deeper gerard into that relationship not looking at trailing months but what the current information is today and what challenges that that relationship is facing so were to barbs point were calling it as we see it today david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah and i this is david i hate to pile on this but its important that people understand that we are because you are given leeway on forbearance from a regulatory standpoint if we believe it needs to be riskrated in a certain way were doing that so thats why you shouldnt see a cliff effect regardless of what the fed says about how we can treat loans or tdrs or anything were calling that independently regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah barbara i godin a deputy chief risk officer chief credit officer regions financial corp exactly gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you gerard operator your final question is from john pancari of evercore john m turner jr a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john rahul patil q analyst evercore group llc hi this is rahul patil on behalf of john i only have one question on the efficiency ratio i believe its like the efficiency ratio was around adjusted basis of youve talked about your willingness to look at expenses a little bit closely if the revenue environment is a challenge can you talk about how youre thinking about the efficiency ratio going forward what sort of level is reasonable assuming that the current conditions kind of stay or persist to at least yearend because i know in the past youve talked about a mid50 im not sure if theres any update on that one david jackson turner jr a chief financial officer senior executive vice president regions financial corp yeah so we still have that as our longterm goal to get our efficiency ratio down into the mid and then when we get there were going to be pushing it even harder so we have a little bit of volatility obviously and revenue given the changing rate environment well have a little bit of pressure on nii as weve mentioned just a minute ago for the next quarter but when you have challenges on revenue then you have to go back and work on expenses and thats part of our program so while you may see that percentage change a bit ph and you get quartertoquarter i think where we are right now is sustainable over time and perhaps working that way down over time as we continue to work on expenses and the benefits from further hedges that actually come into force in the third quarter will help us from a revenue standpoint regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q2 earnings call 17jul2020 john m turner jr president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay well if there are no further questions we really appreciate your participation today thank you for your interest in our company have a good weekend operator this concludes todays conference
