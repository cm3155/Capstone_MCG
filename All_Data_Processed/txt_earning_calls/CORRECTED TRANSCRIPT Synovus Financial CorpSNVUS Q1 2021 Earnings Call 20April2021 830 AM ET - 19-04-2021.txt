more than capable and ready to take the helm i am so proud of all weve done and beyond excited about whats still ahead and thats where id like to focus the remainder of my comments in a presentation the last month kevin identified three tenets that are core to our delivering sustainable topquartile performance the first is being positioned for success which includes capturing the growth in our southeastern footprint and capitalizing on our strong reputation with customers and communities second is providing an exceptional customer experience in which we continue to invest aggressively through efficiencies generated by synovus forward and third is delivering core organic growth which remains our top priority for capital deployment with expectations for core customer loan growth this year consistent with our guidance of to excluding p3 loans our results in the first quarter demonstrated our ability to deliver in these areas adjusted diluted earnings per share were compared to last quarter and a year ago total adjusted revenue of million adjusted expenses of million and a million reversal of provision for credit losses led to strong earnings that further increased capital levels core transaction deposits grew billion helping reduce the total cost of deposits by basis points to commercial loans excluding those under the paycheck protection program increased million or from the end of the year through midapril we processed new phase applications for billion and have funded approximately million for our customers net chargeoff remained low at basis points npa npl and past due ratios all remain near historical lows and we remain confident in the credit performance of our portfolio we continue to be pleased with the progress in our synovus forward initiatives by the end of the quarter weve achieved a pretax run rate benefit of approximately million of the million expected by the end of kevin will provide more detail later on the call again our team did an outstanding job delivering strong results for the quarter and i look forward to continued progress throughout the year and with that overview ill now turn the call over to jamie for the more detailed financial update beginning with loans on slide andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kessel total loans increased million in the first quarter highlighted by million in fundings from the second phase of p3 as well as the million indirect auto portfolio purchase in march with backend loaded growth periodend loan balances were million higher than average balances loan growth of approximately million in commercial loans excluding p3 was led by our specialty verticals while we saw declines in balances associated with our smaller commercial customers total ci loans excluding p3 balances increased million in the first quarter despite total commitment growth of million line utilization declined million and the ratio remained stable at with the recent trillion stimulus plan we expect ci line utilization to remain at or near these historically low levels for longer as synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 customers prioritize use of their own excess liquidity before making meaningful withdrawals returning to a more normalized average of would add approximately million in funded balances total cre loans increased million as the recovery of commercial real estate markets continues total consumer loans excluding lending partnerships declined million the reductions are a continuation of the postcovid trends witnessed across the industry as consumers use government stimulus to reduce revolving credit balances and deleverage this trend was particularly apparent within our consumer mortgage and heloc portfolios which declined million and million respectively we continue to deliver on the p3 program for our customers we have processed billion of p3 loans and funded approximately million todate as part of the second phase of the program we also continue to work through the forgiveness process on phase loans in the first quarter we had million of loans complete the forgiveness process total p3 loans ended the quarter at billion more details related to these loans are available in the appendix total lending partnership loans held for investment increased million led by the purchase of prime auto loans we will continue to use lending partnerships as a strategy to manage the balance sheet which ill discuss further in the capital and liquidity sections as shown on slide we had total deposit growth of million the main drivers of the change include the deposits associated with phase of p3 the clients and public funds and continued remixing of our deposit base deposit growth was led by an increase in core noninterest bearing deposits of billion allowing the continued strategic runoff of higher cost deposits the more favorable mix supports further declines in the total cost of deposits which declined another basis points in the quarter to at the end of the quarter total noninterest bearing deposits accounted for of total deposits which improves our cost of deposits and nii sensitivity the cost of money market deposits fell by basis points and we will continue to manage these costs down in this lowrate environment in the first quarter we were able to reduce the cost of time deposits by basis points to the reduction then included a decline in brokered tds which included million at an average rate of approximately further reductions in deposit costs will come from time deposit maturities as well as further price reductions in nonmaturity deposits slide shows net interest income of million or million excluding p3 fee accretion those figures represent a million decrease from the fourth quarter largely due to lower day count and the continuation of lowrate pressure this includes a greaterthanexpected increase in refinance activity and higher premium amortization within the securities portfolio these headwinds were partially offset by lower deposit costs and the continued deployment of excess liquidity in addition to the increase in lending partnerships the million i referenced earlier we increased the size of the securities book by billion in the first quarter we realized million in p3 fees at quarterend the net unrealized fees were million for phase and million for phase we expect most of the remaining phase fee accretion will occur in the second quarter and phase fee accretion will pick up in the second half of the year as a reminder most phase loans have a twoyear term its a fiveyear term for phase loans securities accounted for approximately of total assets at the end of the quarter and we continue to expect further growth within that portfolio for the foreseeable future to deploy excess liquidity based on current market synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 conditions and our loan growth expectations we reiterate our expectation that our core nii should trough in the first quarter exclusive of accelerated p3 fee accretion as we progress through the year we expect to see increases in nii driven by loan growth deployment of liquidity a deceleration of prepayments and further deposit cost reductions the net interest margin was down basis points from the previous quarter we will continuously monitor our forecasted liquidity position as we consider the appropriate size and composition of our securities and lending partnership portfolios slide shows noninterest revenue of million after adjusting for security losses adjusted noninterest revenue was million up million from the prior quarter and million from the prior year core banking revenues increased million as a million increase in account analysis fees following the first wave of our pricing for value initiative offset declines in nsf fees of million increased customer derivative activity and interest rate movement contributed to a capital markets improvement of million we saw continued growth in assets under management which were up quarteroverquarter and yearoveryear net mortgage revenue of million remained strong although were seeing some normalization in activity from the extended lowrate environment while first quarter mortgage production levels remained elevated the recent increase in interest rates is likely to reduce production levels going forward moving on to noninterest expense on slide total and adjusted noninterest expenses were million adjusted nie was down million from the prior quarter and million from the prior year the employment expense increase of million from the prior quarter includes seasonal first quarter increases in employment taxes and other related employment expenses that were partially offset by the benefit of synovus forward initiatives including a full quarter benefit of the voluntary early retirement program last quarter professional fees declined million from the prior quarter primarily from lower expenses associated with synovus forward p3 and cares actrelated initiatives kevin will share an update on our synovus forward progress shortly we remain committed to prudent expense management enabling us to continue investing in areas that position us for greater success deliver a superior customer experience and promote profitable growth we remain confident in the credit performance of our loan portfolio as you can see on slide key credit metrics remain stable with npa npl and past dues all remaining near historical lows id further note that our allowance estimates show reduced lifeofloan losses versus the prior quarter net chargeoffs declined million to million or basis points given elevated levels of liquidity and continued economic recovery particularly in the southeast we are not expecting a significant change in net chargeoffs in the near term the million reversal of provision for credit losses resulted from the improved economic outlook and stable loan portfolio metrics that were partially offset by the increased size of the loan portfolio as expected we saw an increase in criticized and classified loans that reflects the timing from our grading process which uses trailing quarterly financial statements and reflects the lower levels of revenue experienced during the pandemic approximately of the million increase is hospitalityrelated including hotels and fullservice restaurants the most recent cash inflow data which is located in the appendix shows positive momentum in yearoveryear activity we expect to see a significant reduction in criticized and classified levels as the realtime improvements were seeing in cash inflows which serve as a proxy for revenues translates into improved quarterly financial statements for borrowers synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 this more positive outlook is reflected in the ending acl ratio of excluding p3 loans it is the first quarterly decline since implementing cecl over a year ago the decrease aligns with the more positive economic outlook and reduced uncertainty the allowance at the end of the quarter incorporates an outlook with moderate economic expansion and benefits from the recently approved stimulus there is more detail included in the appendix as noted on slide the cet1 ratio increased basis points to from strong core earnings despite a risk weighted asset increase of billion the rwa increase is primarily from balance sheet management efforts i referenced earlier as well as a million increase in loans held for sale the cet1 ratio grew more than basis points over the past year and we remain above the top end of our to operating range for cet1 we are wellpositioned to complete our key strategic objectives including our commitment to profitable growth our top priority is to deploy our balance sheet to core multisolution relationships we also believe its important to return a portion of current earnings through dividends targeting a longterm payout ratio of to when we are comfortable that our capital is sufficient to cover our primary objectives we consider secondary priorities like share repurchases and noncore growth before handing it over to kevin id like to highlight the active balance sheet management efforts weve taken shown on slide because that goes hand in hand with our ability to deploy excess liquidity as well as capital above the top end of our operating range the first graph is a historical view of our cash position to give a sense for where normalized operating levels were precovid weve talked about the impact on nim but theres also the opportunity cost of not deploying that liquidity current interestbearing funds with the federal reserve of billion are about times higher than normalized levels and weve actively managed our balance sheet the past few quarters to monetize that excess liquidity one way we were able to accomplish this was our lending partnership portfolio which a year ago had approximately billion in held for investment loans with our actions in restructuring the greensky relationship and active management of the other lending partnership portfolios our total lending partnership exposure at quarterend was billion with approximately billion in held for investment loans and approximately million in held for sale loans we will continue to manage this portfolio as we navigate the current capital and liquidity environment in the first quarter we purchased auto loans because we believe that the riskreturn profile twoyear average life and the auto loan market liquidity was a good fit under current market conditions as you can see in the third graph we also increased our securities as a percentage of total assets the yield on first quarter purchases was about the last graph is a historical view of the loantodeposit ratio which currently stands at this provides significant longer term opportunities highlighted by the ability to be more selective and efficient with our funding which youve seen us actively manage over the past year this includes deposits and other liabilities with excess liquidity and capital above the high end of our targeted operating range we can increase assets including securities and loans which results in much higher yields than the overnight rates with the federal reserve we can accomplish this without sacrificing core organic loan growth our highest priority for capital and liquidity deployment ill now turn it over to kevin who will provide some comments about our strategies and provide an update on synovus forward synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 kevin s blair president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thank you jamie id like to begin by thanking kessel for all of his contributions that have helped transform synovus and position us very well for the future the entire synovus leadership team and i sincerely appreciate the unwavering support and especially skillful and influential leadership kessel has provided as ceo and were grateful hell remain in the mix in his role as the executive chairman of the board kessel and i have worked very closely together since i joined the company in hes taught me and our entire team a lot as weve watched and listened to him steer us through challenges no one ever dreamed wed face its certainly an honor to take the helm of this incredible company as we continue to build on the strong foundation that is part of his legacy as kessel stated during his introduction we have been working intently not only to perform in the present but also building upon our core foundations and further transforming the company to be in a position to deliver sustainable topquartile growth slide provides a basis for which we believe creates a compelling formula for our ability to achieve and sustain our topquartile objectives it begins with being positioned for success which is a combination of the longevity and resulting value of a strong core franchise as well as the more recent transformation of the company in the appendix weve included a timeline with a series of highlights under kessels tenure as ceo we certainly dont have time today to discuss all of the accomplishments and transformation over the last years spanning the four phases of stabilize rebuild invest and accelerate however i want to highlight a couple of imperatives that have been instrumental in better positioning synovus for scalable growth and winning in the marketplace during this timeframe we moved to a more centralized banking model without impacting our agility and customer connectivity that has long been a staple of synovus we built out robust and comprehensive risk management procedures and practices while strengthening and diversifying the balance sheet to better withstand periods of stress and lastly we have enhanced our products and solutions as well as expanded our coverage through the addition of talent and through the global one and florida community bank acquisitions as we evaluate our performance over the prior months these previous initiatives and efforts have been essential in helping to weather and overcome the challenges of the economic downturn while continuing to strengthen the bank for the future synovus is wellpositioned competitively within our industry we are large enough and aligned with the right fintechs and partners to deliver the capabilities and functionality of our largest bank competitors we have also doubled down on remaining local and focusing on delivering a personalized approach to banking which competes well with the smaller institutions lastly we have solid coverage across our markets customer segments and industries but we continue to have opportunities to expand our asset classes products and solutions and talent base we also believe were in the best footprint in banking this belief is strongly supported by the demographic and economic data as we evaluate relative comparisons of metrics such as gdp employment rates home prices and many others our fivestate footprint is performing at levels far better than the national averages and we believe this trend will continue and will likely become more pronounced with population and business flows into our markets in addition our capital levels have increased significantly throughout and into and we have demonstrated prudence given the unprecedented changes in the underlying economic environment and we are synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 now in a position to fully utilize our capital to support the organic growth as our current capital levels are in excess of our stated target levels in addition to being wellpositioned we fully understand the importance of and are committed to delivering a superior customer experience the industry attempts to make this more complex than it really is it is all about making it easier to do business with us and through our actions over time building a strong level of trust with our customers we accomplish this by putting their interest first and partnering with them as advisors we have a long and successful track record with high levels of customer loyalty as evidenced by our net promoter scores but we know theres an opportunity to continue to improve we are redesigning customer processes and leveraging technology to further strengthen relationships with a model of hightech meeting high touch with our highly engaged and experienced team members serving as a key point of differentiation it is not about addition by subtraction but rather building synergies from the combination of both aspects the line between service and sales is also becoming blurred customers want advice and guidance and they expect their financial partners to provide it in a proactive manner in order to support their financial objectives we are prioritizing investment in data and analytics as well as the channels that support customer interactions in order to be more proactive and timely in providing insights and advice not only is it leading to creating longer term sticky relationships but it is also generating new sources of revenue which brings me to our third area of focus profitable growth jamie summarized our capital priorities well as we will continue to prioritize core organic growth as our primary objective given the strength of the economic activity in our footprint and our calling activities we are starting to see pipelines and production levels return to prepandemic levels we continue to expect the second half of to be the strongest in terms of growth we have also had a concerted strategy to accelerate the growth in our fee income generation businesses including wealth management treasury and payment solutions and capital markets the first quarter results continue to show good momentum in these areas with increases in wealth management revenues up million or from the fourth quarter as well as aum continuing to grow as jamie referenced earlier treasury and payment solutions overall production and onboarding efforts continue to hit record levels combined with the repricing efforts produced a million or increase in service charges versus the fourth quarter despite increases in customer liquidity and lastly the addition of key talent will serve as a catalyst for growth synovus continues to be a model that is attracting top talent we continue to double down on businesses where we have the right to win and present the opportunity for profitable growth we have increased the producing team members in our wholesale and specialty banking units treasury and payment solutions as well as wealth management ongoing disruption in the industry as well as a targeted approach for expansion will allow us to opportunistically add top talent in areas where we continue to see relatively short payback periods and sources of longterm growth moving to slide this outlines our synovus forward initiatives which weve shared previously we are confident these initiatives will help us achieve our stated objectives and align with the three tenets that kessel outlined earlier as a reminder we expect to achieve a pretax run rate benefit of million by the end of we prioritized efficiency initiatives as we kicked off the program in late in order to fund our journey forward and these initiatives will result in approximately half of the million anticipated pretax benefit synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 at the end of the first quarter we have achieved a pretax run rate benefit of approximately million with about million in cost reductions and million in incremental revenues we are in the process of realizing the additional phase efficiency initiatives and announced in january that we expect to generate an additional million in phase we have initiated the phase program and over the next two quarters we will begin to make decisions that will lead to the incremental savings with the goal to have all of the efficiency programs executed by the fourth quarter of as we continue executing the synovus forward plan the mix of benefits will shift towards revenues as such we are very pleased with the progress weve made in both our commercial analytics and pricing for value revenue initiatives we are currently in the pilot phase of our commercial analytics enhancements which include the smart tool that i detailed on our previous earnings call our team is now receiving and closing actionable leads from this tool and youll begin to see the benefits in both net interest and noninterest revenue lines going forward the smart tool will be fully adopted and in production by the third quarter of this year we remain confident in our ability to generate a pretax run rate benefit of over million by the end of the year we are also in the initial phases of developing a similar tool to be leveraged by our retail and wealth management bankers and expect to have a program in place by yearend our pricing for value initiative in treasury and payment solutions began in the fourth quarter and will continue through the second quarter of results todate have exceeded our expectations with fees increasing million quarteroverquarter and we expect to maintain and even increase profitability in these products as we continue to increase our value proposition in treasury and payment solutions including our new synovus gateway platform priority service and enhanced solutions delving deeper into our focus on expanding our products and solutions sales in our new merchant solution continue to outpace our expectations and we are turning our attention to rolling out additional functionality and capabilities in including international export financing integrated payables and receivables and a one card digital wallet solution to achieve sustainable topquartile growth we understand that continued investments in technology and talent are paramount as we evaluate the need to balance shortterm headwinds from interest rates or economic activity we have emphasized not making shortterm decisions that impact our longterm valuation or growth opportunities as such it requires more rigorous prioritization and focusing more intently on businesses where we have the right and proven track record of winning synovus forward is predicated on supporting our aspirations as a growth bank and not simply cutting our way to prosperity now before i turn it back over to qa i want to make a couple final comments regarding the ceo transition since our announcement in december weve been asked a lot about how the strategies will be changing under new leadership while therell be some changes over time like kessel i will continue to execute the synovus forward plan we have both been aligned with the companys direction and areas of emphasis outlined in synovus forward and our other strategic initiatives we are both clear on our strengths as well as our opportunities for improvement also we both have a lot of confidence in the synovus team and our ability to win versus the largest and smallest competitors and lastly we are both committed to lead our company forward to deliver on both our short and longterm objectives while not losing sight of what makes synovus a great company its team members its customers and the communities we serve synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 with that ill turn the call over to our operator for qa question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning guys kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning ph ebi ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess first and foremost congratulations on pulling off what has been one of the most remarkable turnarounds in banks postfinancial crisis so job well done and i guess in terms of the question im just trying to reconcile what jamie talked about in terms of loan growth and the impact from stimulus and savings both on the commercial and consumer side and i think kevin you mentioned about like pipeline and production levels back to prepandemic levels just talk to us i think theres a fair amount of debate around whether or not the banks will see a pickup in loan growth give us a sense of given that a wide swath of the economy in your footprint is already open are you seeing a pickup in loan demand and i guess i understand the second halfweighted loan growth but should we start expecting better sort of color from you in terms of loan growth picking up over the next few months just give us the puts and takes on that kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp ebrahim its interesting when you think about the puts and takes as you state when you look at the liquidity that exists in the marketplace today we were talking about this yesterday the average balance per checking account in commercial is up yearoveryear and on the consumer side its up yearoveryear so when you think about the headwinds that exist that are leading to lower loan growth its really the amount of liquidity thats sitting on the customers balance sheets synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 now we know that over time that will abate a bit but the things that were seeing that give us confidence first and foremost as i mentioned our pipelines are increasing they were up in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter of last year we know that our bankers are becoming more active theyre going on prospect calls theyre having discussions with customers who are starting to plan capital expenditures for the second half of the year we also know that there is a tremendous amount of opportunity with some of the new tools that were rolling out through our smart tool it does give us insights into opportunities where we have lending opportunities where in the past we may not have known that with existing customers and then when you think about our footprint and you look at some of the data unemployment in our fivestate footprint is all below every state is below with the national average at you look at the net population inflows all five states are in the top in the country so when you take into consideration that there could be some demand coming from infrastructure coming from second half of the year economic activity combine that with where we see our footprint growing and then you add into that the increases in talent and the productivity gains were making we feel like the second half of the year is going to be constructive but again the biggest wildcard there will be the liquidity that sits on the balance sheet and how long that sticks around andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hey ebrahim this is jamie let me add one thing we reiterated our guidance for to loan growth in and as youre aware we had an auto loan purchase in the first quarter our guidance remains the same on the to loan growth excluding any sort of thirdparty lending portfolio purchases like what we saw in the first quarter so as kevin mentioned we feel good about our pipeline we believe its weighted to the back half of the year and were excluding in that guidance any sort of portfolio purchases like you saw this quarter ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats good to know so thanks for clarifying that jamie and i guess just as a followup to that on slide where you have the liquidity and you talked about that is the message there that you would now pick up steam in terms of bringing down those cash balances which historically used to be i think million to billion to bring them down via loan purchases or investment securities deployment over the next few quarters just give us a little more color around the thought process of when liquidity levels could get back to normalized levels andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ebrahim that is our intent our priority is to deploy that liquidity and excess capital to customer loan growth however this is an unprecedented environment and government stimulus programs remain including quantitative easing and so we expect core transaction deposit growth to continue and we believe that the liquidity situation may stay at a similarly elevated level through and so we are prepared for that we will consider using strategies like what you saw in the first quarter be it with the securities portfolio growth or thirdparty assets were going to be very prudent in how we deploy that liquidity and that capital but you may see continuations of those strategies in january we gave guidance of the securities portfolio growing to to of total assets in the first quarter you saw that we increased that to and i would say that its likely that that trends to the topend of that range as we proceed through synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator the next question is from brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey kessel congrats on a great tenure and run as ceo youll certainly be missed on these calls but congratulations kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co yeah jamie i wanted to start maybe with to follow up maybe on the revenue guidance of down to in it seems youre off to a little bit of a faster start in some of your fee revenue categories for this time in the year and then also last quarter you talked about steepness of the curve better performance with ppp obviously you guys have talked a lot about your thoughts around loan growth in the back half of the year indiscernible perform at the highend of that range it would seem kind of given your start to the year you could do that but just kind of wanted to see if you could maybe frame that up a little bit more kind of why youre stuck with that guidance is it just really kind of more the uncertainty thats out there but it seems like there are several things going your way at this point andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp brad thanks for the question youre right that the first quarter was strong especially in our fee revenue businesses mortgage continues to perform well in this environment and i believe thats just a testament to the mortgage team and us delivering for our customers in an environment lowrate environment where theres so much mortgage activity that was strong in the first quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 we expect it to continue to be strong as the normalization continues through so we expect mortgage revenues to decline to prepandemic levels over the next few quarters but we expect that those revenue declines will be offset by broadbased growth in our other fee revenue businesses and products such as credit card trust and fiduciary deposit service charges and capital markets and so we do expect to see those trends generally in fee revenue and then with regards to interest income we expect the first quarter to be the low point for the fullyear and we expect to see growth as we proceed through in nii and to your point and your question thats due to two things one is the balance sheet and we just discussed that with ebrahims question we do expect growth the to growth we are reiterating that but were also seeing growth in assets based on strategic decisions were making in treasury and thats the thirdparty lending thats the securities portfolio growth and we also expect to see a tailwind to your point on interest rate the steepening of the curve and long rates increasing are a positive to us and if rates can stabilize or even increase from here the pressure weve been experiencing on loan origination and mortgage prepayments will abate and they may become supportive of future interest income it also reduced the premium amortization that we saw in the first quarter on the securities portfolio which led to the lower book yield on the securities book brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful and then this is my followup adjusted expenses were down maybe a little less than million yearoveryear i think you talk about million being in the run rate at this point is sort of the delta there mortgage commissions or other commissions that you might see reverse out or do you think about maybe you spent some of those savings in other areas just trying to kind of bridge the gap in expenses with the numbers youre talking about with synovus forward andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah you are exactly right as mortgage revenues remain elevated you will see elevated commission expense associated with that but ill also just point to the seasonal impact of normal personnel expenses in the first quarter they remain elevated that was also a component of the first quarter brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you guys kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks brad operator the next question is from brad gailey from kbw please go ahead brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks its brady good morning guys synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brady kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning brady brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so i wanted to start just with the thirdparty lending partnerships youre at i think about billion as of the end of the quarter thats about of nonppp loans whats the appetite to continue to grow that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp brady thats a portfolio that we look at in multifacets specifically when you look at the held for sale portfolio thats a different risk profile than a typical held for investment loan portfolio and thats why we segregated it on our slide in the earnings presentation so we view that risk differently so its lower risk because of the commitment to purchase component of it but then when you look at the held for investment portfolio we feel confident in our ability to manage that portfolio and to grow it from where we are today if you look at the assets that we are purchasing we believe that the liquidity and marketability and credit risk that were taking by investing in those assets relative to the securities portfolio is were paid for that risk we believe we can manage that risk and we have experience managing that portfolio in all environments if you consider the actions we took in as well and so we feel confident in that portfolio we feel confident in leveraging it as a way to deploy capital and liquidity and ill specifically point to the auto purchase in the first quarter because the way we look at that is we look at it as a prime auto portfolio with about a little more than a 2year average life and that profile fits really well with how we view capital and liquidity and so thats the type asset were looking for something that fits well with our longer term view but also an asset class thats very marketable and very liquid brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then my followup i wanted to ask you the stock has done well all bank stocks have done well recently but synovus is now at times tangible so maybe that makes the share buybacks a little less attractive but on the flip side you now have a currency that you havent had in a while so maybe bank ma is a little more realistic for you guys but how do you think about what the stock price has done and what impact that could have on buybacks versus bank ma kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp well look brady this is kevin in the capital priorities weve said our number one way to invest capital is back in organic growth and with excess capital we would look at share repurchase we would look at nonbank ma and we would look at alternative use of capital as jamie mentioned with thirdparty purchases so we evaluate all of those on a return basis synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 but as you think about ma we talked about having our right to win i would just reiterate that we think our best investment today is an investment in synovus and we believe that because as jamie mentioned earlier we love our footprint we think it provides us with outsized opportunities for growth we also feel that weve been very capable in attracting talent and adding new products and solutions to our another arrow in our quiver to be able to promote growth we also feel like a lot of the reasons that people are doing ma is to just generate efficiency and weve been doing that internally jamie touched on the efficiency initiatives but i think its important to note that weve reduced fte in the last two quarters or roughly of our workforce and were doing that through synovus forward and so were generating efficiencies internally and we like the size of our company i think there is a lot of conversations that go into scale and having to invest to be more relevant on the technology front we feel that were relevant today we have the right partners and the right fintech solutions that we feel like we can compete with anyone and then audio gap you have to integrate cultures and theres a mismatch there and then you have to look at what potentially could be the lost revenues that are a function of team member attrition as well as customer attrition so when you take all of that into consideration we still believe that the best investment is in synovus and thats what were doing going forward now from an ma perspective if we were to do anything weve said very clearly it would be a functionality or capability or technology that would be additive to our portfolio of solutions and would be additive to our existing customer base and any of those would be relatively small brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great hey kessel its amazing what youve done with this company and the transition over the last decade congrats on a job well done and good luck with the transition kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp okay thanks a lot brady operator the next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared maybe first just drilling into the expense picture again on the fourth quarter call i think the guidance for was a reduction of to that was pretty much covered here in the first quarter i guess as we look ahead maybe help quantify what else is going to drop to the bottom line and if that to reduction announced last quarter if thats still a good rate that we should be expecting for the year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah this is jamie great question we do reiterate the guidance of down to and as we were discussing earlier higher revenues in some of our fee businesses may impact commissions but we still feel confident in our guidance of that decline of to as we look forward in obviously we have announced today that we synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 as of we have million in run rate benefit in the synovus forward initiatives and as weve mentioned from the outset we expect approximately twothirds of the first million to be expense initiatives so we still have a ways to go in along the expense side through synovus forward initiatives and thatll come through later in the year youll see that in the second half of the year and so we believe that thats going to be a tailwind to the second half we would reiterate that we expect second half expenses to be lower than first half and well see those flow through in the second half of the year we announced today that were closing four branches in the second quarter thatll be a piece of it and then we continue to have benefits on some of our other work streams that have been in progress like thirdparty spend corporate real estate as well as personnel initiatives timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you and then as a followup just looking at the securities purchases made during the quarter it looks like the duration in the securities book increased a couple of years maybe just talk about utilizing some of the excess liquidity whether its through securities or thirdparty purchases your willingness to take on duration and how you balance that with balance sheet positioning for potentially a steeper yield curve andor higher rates down the road andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thats a good question youre right the duration did extend in the first quarter and that was largely due to the increase in interest rates just the convexity profile of that portfolio if you were to see interest rates continue to increase on the long end we would expect to see further extension even though i would say that at some point you get to a terminal duration on some of these mortgage assets we have remained diligent with the assets were putting on the books we have been buying mortgages at a premium and its fairly well split between year mortgages 15year and 20year mortgages and some with structure to protect against extension and so we havent changed our investment profile the duration extension really is due to interest rates alone but youre right we did have a significant amount of investments in the first quarter approximately billion the going on yield of those investments was around to depending on the asset and we will look to grow that portfolio this year approach the topend of our guidance that to of total assets as we go through the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great again echo my congratulations for you kessel and thank you for the questions kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah thanks so much operator the next question is from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 hey good morning thanks for taking my questions kessel congrats again on a great job as the ceo as everyone else has stated my question is around credit i did notice that criticized and classified were up a little bit obviously the credit picture continues to improve i guess what drove that and then just from a provision standpoint i think youve talked about getting the loan loss reserve back to kind of day one postcecl day one levels at some point down the road has the outlook improved where we could see very low levels of provision as we move forward for at least the next couple of quarters thanks kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp hey michael this is kevin ill take that and this may be a bit of a lengthy answer just because i want to be comprehensive but i think its important when you look at the credit metrics this quarter to look at the entire body of work as jamie mentioned were relatively stable with npas npls chargeoffs and our provision is showing an improving environment but as you ask looking specifically at criticized and classified i think its important to note that our grading process is largely a function of historical financial statements so the movement you saw this quarter was more of a result of the headwinds that we saw back in and those revenue headwinds being incorporated into the respective financial statements for this year as weve been doing our grading process most of the increase was related to our covidimpacted industries hospitality and restaurants indiscernible related to some consumer mortgages that remained on deferment under the standard gse standard guidance and ill remind you that with most of those covidrelated industries despite the revenue challenges as we said back in we felt strong ltvs and sponsorships would mitigate much of the risk that we saw there so i would tell you that the criticized and classified ratios are really a rearview mirror perspective on credit and i think its important to note even with the increases our absolute levels for criticized and classified are below that of our peers now i think to truly reflect and assess what the credit environment and the expectations are going forward i think you have to look at more of the realtime data and forwardlooking measurement so in our appendix we did provide the updated cash inflow data from january and february and i think when you look at that michael youll see that in aggregate our businesses have returned to prepandemic levels in terms of cash inflow we also know through our second round of p3 that we had another billion in application volume so we know many of those covidimpacted industries are being supported through economic stimulus and then when you look at some of the underlying data in things like hospitality youll see that adrs in the hotel industry are returning to normalized levels weve seen occupancy pick up significantly in florida with all of the markets there with the exception of orlando in recent months having over occupancy and we expect that to continue into the summer indiscernible and people starting to go out and travel into the footprint in these drivable destinations and then on the same front you look at restaurants qsrs are performing at or above where they were prepandemic and youre starting to see full and limitedservice restaurants back to of the levels that they had so very strong improvement there and then lastly i would tell you to look at as you go forward and have an outlook the as jamie mentioned on the call the cecl lifeofloan estimates continue to decline with this reversal in provision this quarter and based upon our economic forecast we would expect this to continue and we would also expect to see a significant level of upgrades in the coming quarters while our chargeoffs are going to remain fairly low in the nearterm so hopefully that addresses the credit question jamie ill let you cover the provision andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 thanks kevin as kevin mentioned the allowance ph for loan ratio declined quarteronquarter we believe thats indicative of the environment we would say that theres a significant amount of uncertainty in the outlook we still have a large weighting to adverse scenarios in our cecl modeling but we also i would point to the fact that weve made adjustments to model inputs in our quantitative portion of our allowance calculation at a high level these adjustments are due to our expectation that stimulus will serve to delay chargeoffs rather than cure them if our outlooks change if our outlook changes to the expectation that stimulus is a cure then our lifeofloss estimates would decrease fairly significantly so i would point to that as one impact and we will see how this plays out as we get further along but that is a key assumption in our allowance calculation michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc its a very comprehensive answer so i appreciate it just one quick followup so last quarter you talked about mortgage revenues being down to it seems like its going to be better than that just based on your pipeline the hirings that youve made and kind of the strength in your markets any sort of gauge for what youd expect that to be down now this year thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah michael this is jamie i would adjust that range to down to i would acknowledge that thats a broad range and hopefully we end up at the highend of that range but i would definitely expect to see it higher than what we were expecting in january michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking all my questions andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thanks michael kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thanks michael operator the next question is from john pancari from evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning john synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning john kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi kessel i just wanted to say best of luck i hope you make the most of retirement and certainly welldeserved kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks john pancari q analyst evercore isi so just i just want to start on the nii outlook i know you had indicated that you see the first quarter as a trough and you expect upside from here what can you just maybe talk about what margin assumption is behind that just how you think about the progression of the margin from here given the shape of the curve excluding the impact of ppp thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah john when you back out the impact of the paycheck protection program we actually would expect to see margin improvement as we head through the year depending on how you would calculate the impact of ppp its we would say that the paycheck protection program impact in the first quarter was somewhere along the lines of to basis points which is less than the straight fee income impact but also including the rate on those loans which is nondilutive and so we expect just like we expect nii we would expect the margin to increase as we go through the year due to the benefit of interest rates longterm interest rates and higher interest rates than where we are now and the improved going on yields and so we think thats a tailwind but i would give it a big caveat that there were not its uncertain how much liquidity will be on the balance sheet and so the cash impact is significant youre well aware that the impact is approximately basis points per billion and so that is uncertain and that could be very dilutive to the margin but not impactful to nii as we go through the rest of this year john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks jamie thats helpful and then in terms of the loan growth it was more about timing is kind of what im interested in in terms of how are you thinking about it internally in terms of the timing of the return of your line utilization off that level to that normalized and i guess the same goes for the production levels reaching the prepandemic point how do you think about the timing given how things are trajecting are we looking at if not through the back half of this year is it in the first half of next year i just want to get an idea of how you expect that progression thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah john its a great question and theres a lot of assumptions and uncertainties that go into that to your point were pointing towards the second half of the year and thats just based upon our trended data that shows as i said earlier pipelines are up in the first quarter and production is only now about down versus the first quarter of so were continuing to see improvement and as pipelines improve as bankers become more active were optimistic that well start to see loan growth pick up now as jamie mentioned this quarter a big reason for our core growth being down was because of the consumer book so we saw more churn on the consumer mortgage portfolio and that led to about million reduction in heloc but i think its important to note that we did see a growth in both ci although it was modest and cre so we expect that trend to continue and as we said at the beginning of the year we expect that mid singledigit growth in cre and ci and consumer was going to be a challenge now jamie also mentioned earlier how we are able to offset some of the runoff in mortgage and home equity with the purchase book but we remain optimistic on the commercial side john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks so much kevin operator the next question is from david bishop from seaport global securities please go ahead david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities yeah thank you good morning gentlemen id like to reiterate my congratulations to kessel on a stellar career there at synovus kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp thanks david david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities hey a quick question sort of drilling down maybe on the margin and more on the maybe taking a look at the deposit side here obviously you guys are bumping along near historic lows there just curious where if you think you could take them even lower here and maybe where you see the bottom for deposit cost here over the nearterm andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 yeah dave this is jamie thanks for the question we do believe we have opportunities to further reduce deposit cost as we go through for multiple reasons first is time deposits we have billion maturing here in the second quarter at approximately just a little bit more than a rate and we believe that well likely continue to run those off as we go through the year the higher cost time deposits and we believe we also have opportunities to further reduce nonmaturity deposits weve had success working with our customers on nonmaturity deposits over the past few quarters and we expect that to continue so if the rate and liquidity environment remains similar to the current expectations were targeting a total deposit cost in the midteens this will rely on future efforts to further reduce all of these deposit costs but we feel confident in the teams ability to achieve those david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities got it thats good color then maybe sort of conversely on the loan yield side it looks like those are stabilizing just curious what youre seeing across the various markets and in products there just with the economy opening up across your footprint and across the country there are you seeing sort of risk premiums being washed away somewhat are you able to better price for risk here just curious what youre seeing just in terms of loan yields present and just loan yields in general across the market thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah no dave its a great question i think if you look at our entire book ex fees our portfolio is about and production is coming in a little below that in the range on the yield side and i think it goes back to jamies point with the excess liquidity that exists not only in banking but across the entire spectrum that we havent seen people changing strictures or changing their risk profile but we have seen people competing on price and obviously thats easier to do when youre carrying the cash balances that most commercial banks are carrying so its becoming look in my career its never been a call where ive said that its not competitive on price but now its as competitive as ever but its on the high credit quality type loans its not on chasing risk and trying to price for it its everyones trying to stay down the middle of the fairway but price appropriately to win business which means that we have some pressure on the margin there david jason bishop q analyst seaport global securities got it thank you for the color operator the next question is from steven duong from rbc capital markets please go ahead steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steve kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning steve synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc so just first i just noticed that aoci had a good drop this quarter can you just speak to what were the drivers bringing down the aoci account andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah steve that really has to do with the unrealized gain on the securities portfolio and interest rates increasing steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so that was just simply okay yeah and kevin youd mentioned that the synovus forward will youre going to start shifting more towards the revenue side with some of that coming from net interest income so is that essentially meaning that its coming from increased loan growth looking forward kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp its really all of the above steve when we look at our revenue initiatives we talk about the million that we had accomplished in the quarter about million of that came from our treasury repricing and another million from deposit repricing and we had million in some of our ancillary fee income as we look to the future revenue initiatives there will be an expansion through our analytics program where if you just break it down analytics is providing insights to our frontline bankers who then are able to go out and proactively sell new solutions some of those solutions are going to be lending some of them are going to be money market and savings accounts which obviously have an impact on the margin others are going to be related to treasury and payment solutions and so thatll show up more on the fee income line so we havent given a specific mix and where those are coming in because part of it is as we execute on those leads well have a better recognition of where the revenue is coming from but what we have seen from the pilot phases of the smart tool the majority of the leads in this first round are coming on the fee income side so were seeing it more on the treasury side now as we go forward in some of the revenue initiatives that we have in play into itll be bringing on new specialty lending teams itll be adding new products and solutions to the lending platform so there will be additional nii that comes from that so as we execute on those revenue initiatives well provide a better delineation of the geography of where its hitting the pl steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it i really appreciate the color on that and kessel just echoing everybodys sentiment best wishes on the next stage kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you very much operator the next question is from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning i wanted to ask about the comments kevin made earlier in the call about the ability to price for advice and i was curious if any of the revenue gains thus far i know its early on synovus forward has reflected that or is there some price increases that youre getting or would we think about this as just net new business kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp chris its a great question i think its both so when we see today the we just mentioned the million quarterly run rate impact that weve gotten from what we call pricing for value comes out of our treasury and payment solutions area so we have increased pricing there but those are increasing to market levels and i think not only is it important to reference their market levels i think its important to be able to maintain that pricing you have to provide value and so for us its about increasing the amount of advice and consultation were providing to our commercial customers as it relates to cash management services and what we can do for them to save them time and money as it relates to new products i think a lot of the advice from a revenue standpoint will be about how do we execute its bringing over assets under management by being a financial advisor its doing financial plans in our branches to be able to unearth some of the opportunities that our branches are getting with our consumer customers and on the commercial side were running things like its called client planning where were sitting down and understanding all of the opportunities that we have with the client based on what theyre using today so then it results in having to go out and sell those products so advice to me is something that you can get paid for you just have to deliver it in a timely manner and it has to be something where the customer finds a benefit in the solution christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it thats helpful kevin and real quick you are getting new business out of the florida fcb franchise i know its evolving but i just want to confirm that kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah were getting growth out of florida look thats one of the reasons that we liked the florida acquisition was that that marketplace is growing now in general i was going to mention earlier that when you look at just account growth this quarter we had consumer net new accounts this quarter we had net new commercial checking accounts this quarter and that came from all over our fivestate footprint but both of those numbers are high watermarks for new accounts and thats net new so were seeing account growth across the franchise and i think south florida and central florida have been big contributors to the growth christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks again for all the information this morning and kessel best wishes in your next chapter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks chris operator the next question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is anthony elian on for steve a followup on the revenue outlook kevin you identified on slide the three areas that should help the company deliver sustainable topquartile performance but you maintained the guidance of adjusted revenue to decline to this year i know you said youre starting to see strength in some fee income products but when could we expect to start seeing a more material pickup in total revenue growth is this more of a second half of event or more of kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp anthony its a great question because i think to your point when youre evaluating growth on top line revenue one thing thats important to note as we enter and as we move throughout the year is that weve been hindered a bit by our asset sensitivity so the reduction in rates is putting some headwinds on top line i dont think that takes away from the fact that we still feel very confident at some of the underlying levers of growth as i mentioned earlier were starting to see opportunities where the loan growth is starting to play out in the second half of the year we had cre growth in the first quarter and were expecting ci to pick up with or without utilization we talked about our ability to generate growth in fee income were up in fiduciary and asset management up yearoveryear in card fees up in brokerage so the fee income businesses are continuing to contribute weve also talked previously about investing in specialization and specialty lending within our wholesale bank if you look at where weve grown there yearoveryear were up million in loan growth in our specialty finance area public finance is up senior housing and specialty healthcare up i give you all those because we believe that there are core pockets of growth that are going to start to be seen once the overhang of the reduction in interest rates kind of falls out so latter half of into we think the story is going to be more compelling anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then my followup how much of the billion of core transaction deposit growth you saw this quarter would you say is sticky versus temporary due to things like stimulus payments kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp well i think you can look at the amount of funding that we said we had on p3 and that was about million so lets just say you subtract that out it would still suggest that more than half of the balances came on as sticky deposits now when we say sticky deposits as jamie mentioned earlier is it sticky for the next years or is it sticky for the next years but we do believe there was high quality growth outside of the p3 balances that we were able to fund this quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 anthony elian q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thank you and echoing everyone kessel congratulations on everything and best of luck going forward kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator the next question is from brody preston from stephens inc please go ahead brody preston q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone thanks for all the time this morning ill try to be brief here jamie i was hoping maybe you could just help us ringfence a dollar amount around in the salaries and personnel expense how much was seasonal and sort of where you would expect that to go in the second quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah brody in the first quarter we had approximately million to million that was seasonal just annual increases in personnel expense and so thats what will go away as we go through this year brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and the four branches that you outlined i think the previous benefit from the last closures was about per branch is that a similar kind of benefit this go around andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp i assume per branch brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay okay great and then just one on the loan portfolio i noticed that the senior housing ticked up quite a bit this quarter just wanted to ask how much of that was ppprelated and how much was nonppprelated and then just more broadly on the entire loan portfolio jamie or kevin maybe you could just give us a sense for what percent of the portfolio is floating rate at this point kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah ill take the first on senior housing brody none of the growth in senior housing was related to p3 it was all organic growth we actually brought in seven new relationships to the bank this quarter in senior housing they continue to do very well we have none of those loans that are in deferment we have none that are past due so that portfolio has held up extremely well and now theres opportunities for expansion as you know that team has been doing this for quite some time they follow operators around the country and so theres going to be synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 continued new opportunities there we have taken the opportunity to grow that book but none of it is related to p3 when you look at the growth this quarter in general healthcare continues to be a good area of growth for us in general not just senior housing weve also seen growth in the construction industry as bob has mentioned in the past we also saw growth this quarter in professional services financial and insurance as well and a little bit of growth in manufacturing so were starting to see it broadbased across several industries which is good but senior housing is just one of those areas jamie ill let you answer the variable rate andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah were variable rate brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay and i guess what percent of that would you consider floating andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp all of that is floating rate and of that about of loans are primebased and you have around that are based off of libor brody preston q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you for taking my questions i appreciate it guys kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director

andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi jennifer kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc kessel congratulations on an amazing tenure were going to miss working with you kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp thanks jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc two questions really quick kevin you mentioned youll likely be hiring some specialty teams over the next one or two years can you give us some more color on that and my second question is if you look at the submarkets across the synovus footprint which one seemed particularly ripe for more market share gains for you right now thanks kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp yeah thanks jennifer look as you think about specialty it really come out of two forms one would be industrytype specialties focusing on specific industries and id throw things out there like qsrs transportation logistics things that fit within our footprint where today were covering them and not always covering them with specialists but with generalists were looking to build out our capability there weve proven that when you bring in specialty teams it provides a value to our customers and it generates growth so were looking at industry and then the second would be on product as you think about the products that we offer today we dont have a full set of asset classes so we may look to expand into leasing or equipment finance or accelerate some of our specialty lending areas into new forms of assetbased lending so those are the two areas we would look and then in terms of growth look i would start with the markets that were already strong in you look at markets like atlanta where we have a strong market share when you have that sort of density it provides you with an opportunity to continue to grow we think the underlying market is growing and as you know theres some disruption in that market but i would also look at the florida market i mentioned earlier south florida central florida tremendous opportunity when you see the number of businesses and the amount of population growth thats happened in florida we need to make sure that we continue to exercise our right to win in that footprint and then i wouldnt leave out some of these secondary markets that we often talk about greenville charleston augusta georgia places where we feel like we have an opportunity to win and were picking up market share and its probably not on the radar of some of the large bulge bracket firms jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 thank you operator the next question is from kevin fitzsimmons from da davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone kessel d stelling jr a chairman chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin s blair a president chief operating officer director synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co first real quick can i ask about the reserve ratio that i recognize the change in expectations and that led to the negative provision assuming there is no material change in where expectations go from here would we expect a positive provision as you have better loan growth but for that ratio to come down more gradually than what we saw this quarter i know thats tough without you put the different inputs in the model but assuming what you see looking out from here thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp kevin its jamie what i would say the way i would answer that is similar to what we said in indiscernible theres uncertainty we believe that our allowance is adequate given our outlook and the uncertainty in the outlook but we do see scenarios where credit costs remain low and chargeoffs remain low like what were our guidance right now is for chargeoffs to remain low in the nearterm we feel like we have line of sight into that and then well see where it goes from there and as i mentioned earlier at some point you will come to a resolution around the question of did stimulus delay chargeoffs or did it cure chargeoffs and for us thats the important question with regards to our allowance and i believe that thats more of a function of time because we need to get past the incremental stimulus efforts to really know the state of all of our creditors all of our borrowers and so thats what were looking for but we feel good about where we are right now as you see our allowance to loan ratio declined basis points on the quarter adjusted for p3 if you look at our guidance on chargeoffs its for stable at a very low level we feel good with what we see in the loan book today and thats something that well constantly reassess as we go through we do remain of the belief that in a more normalized environment assuming no material changes to loan mix that we will approach a day one allowance level and for us that was but were uncertain of the timing of that kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2021 thats great thank you and last but certainly not least i just want to say congrats to kessel its been a privilege and honor for me for several years to cover synovus and to

thats a loaded question thanks for those comments you might make it tough for me to close i dont know that i have a proud moment im proud of this team and im proud of the tenacity of the team if i look back to charterers consolidated when people thought that that could never change i think of the gosh the recapture of the dta the repayment of tarp in a way that was much more efficient i think than the market expected gosh the creativity of the cabelas transaction which was kind of lost where we received a million fee for facilitating a transaction that quite frankly has called on our regulatory standing and our knowledge of that industry and then two i think great acquisitions global one fcb but the glue that held that all together was the again the tenacity of the team the united nature of our board which never wavered throughout my tenure when there were some tough days kevin as you remember and then again our customers never left us we had sticky customers through the crisis we have sticky customers today and again im proud of the relationships we formed with those of you on this call ive received so many notes not just nice things said today but notes as weve been on this call from many of you ive traveled with many of you ive probably argued with many of you but i have deep respect for what you all do for our industry and you really do help make our company better i will just add one last thing many of you have congratulated me on retirement i dont consider this a retirement its a new phase as i move into executive chair i am allin in helping this team and this company succeed as a matter of fact at this morning we gathered in jamies office and i in a very serious way asked jamie and kevin to think about and i was pretty serious they werent to think about what role they wanted me to play in preparing them for the next quarter earnings call and i got kind of a blank look so i think more to come on that but im allin for this company so i guess kevin i always said i wanted to leave this company better than when i found it there were some great leaders before me i hope ive done that again im proud of the relationships im proud of i hope the reputation we have for transparency with you guys transparency with our regulators and again the support that ive enjoyed from board to executive team to the indiscernible in the most remote branch its just been an honor to serve this company and i appreciate your comments and thank you for that question kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co congrats again thanks kessel kessel d
