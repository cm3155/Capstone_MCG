director discover financial services thanks craig and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call in these uniquely challenging times im pleased with discovers results and how well our business model has performed in the third quarter we earned million aftertax or per share we clearly benefited from the actions we took in the first half of this year to protect employees manage credit risk and control costs while preserving momentum on longterm investments while significant uncertainty remains as to the extent and timing of a recovery we were pleased to see the return to yearoveryear sales growth in september managing credit remains a top priority we entered this recession from a strong credit position due to our traditionally conservative approach to underwriting as well as actions taken over the past few years to reduce our contingent liability and tighten credit at the margin we quickly implemented changes to credit policy at the onset of the pandemic including tightening criteria for new accounts and line increases and additional income verification while we saw a very strong credit performance this quarter we expect to see deterioration in the coming quarters as the prime consumer may be impacted by increasing permanent whitecollar unemployment that discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 said we believe we have taken the appropriate credit actions and dont see the need to make significant changes at this time the improvements in sales volume continued during the quarter with a return to growth in the month of september sales have improved across all categories with particular strength in online retail home improvement and everyday spend categories partially offset by continued weakness in travel and entertainment spending loan growth continues to be affected by the pandemic with total loans down yearoveryear including card loans down and personal loans down the drop in spending during the pandemic and our own credit tightening has impacted loan growth but another driver has been a significantly higher payment rate in our card and personal loan portfolios consumers have had improved household cash flows due to reduced spending in government stimulus and have taken this opportunity to boost savings and make larger payments against their loans in our student loan business originations in the peak season were down yearoveryear reflecting the large number of students who chose not to enroll this fall even in this challenging environment our organic student loans were up reflecting innovative features like our multiyear loan and our strong competitive position in terms of operating expenses we remain on track to deliver million of cost reductions this year while continuing to invest in core capabilities such as advanced analytics to increase efficiency and drive longterm value in conclusion this quarter our business generated high returns as weve remained focused on disciplined credit management profitable growth and an industryleading customer experience supported by our usbased customer service the economic environment remains uncertain but our strong capital and liquidity and the actions we have taken to strengthen the business position allows us to continue to drive longterm value for our shareholders ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you roger and good morning everyone thanks for joining us ill walk through our results starting on slide we earned per share driven by solid credit performance of our portfolio and significantly lower operating expenses while total revenue was down from last year reflecting the slowdown in the economy sales volume turned positive in september and net interest margin expanded nicely net interest income was down as the impact of lower market rates was partially offset by lower funding costs in addition average receivables were down contributing to the decline in net interest income noninterest income was down driven by lower fee income reflecting fewer late fee instances and the impact of lower overall spending on cash advance fees the decrease in net discount and interchange revenue was driven by sales volume in the quarter the provision for credit losses improved by nearly million from the prior year as a result of a decline in net chargeoffs and a lower reserve build operating expenses were down yearoveryear driven by marketing expenses and professional fees turning to loan growth on slide total loans were down from the prior year driven by a decrease in card receivables lower card receivables were driven by three factors a higher payment rate as customers continue to discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 be mindful of their debt obligations a decline in promotional balances as a result of credit tightening which will benefit net interest margin going forward and third lower sales volume in the quarter sales were down just on a yearoveryear basis sales returned to growth in september up yearoveryear with improvement in all categories grocery retail and home improvement were very strong the trend continued through the first half of october with sales up in our other lending products organic student loans increased from the prior year and personal loans decreased moving to slide our net interest margin bottomed out in the second quarter and improved basis points to in the current quarter relative to the second quarter nim increased primarily due to favorable consumer deposit pricing since june we have decreased our online savings rate basis points down to approximately twothirds of our consumer deposits are indeterminate maturity accounts primarily savings which has provided an immediate benefit from deposit rates decreases average consumer deposits were up year overyear and up billion from the second quarter looking at slide you can see how our funding mix has changed over time were also providing details on our funding maturities and corresponding rates over the next couple of years given our current excess liquidity position we expect to issue very little wholesale debt in the near term the majority of our new deposits have been in online savings and we would expect this trend to continue in the current low rate environment as we move towards our target at to of funding from consumer deposits we expect to see continued benefits to net interest margin turning to slide total operating expenses were down million or from the prior year marketing and business development expense was down million or the bulk of the reduction was in brand marketing and card acquisition professional fees decreased million or mainly driven by lower thirdparty recovery fees related to court closures as well as favorable vendor pricing adjustments employee compensation was up million or driven by staffing increases mainly in technology as well as higher average salaries and benefit costs to date weve realized approximately of the targeted million of expense reductions we discussed over the past two quarters were on track to deliver the remaining in the fourth quarter and continue to review the business for efficiency opportunities turning now to slide showing credit metrics credit performance remained very strong in the third quarter card net chargeoff dollars actually came down million while the rate increased basis points sequentially the card net chargeoff rate improved basis points the 30plus delinquency rate improved basis points from last year and basis points from the prior quarter as credit performance of our card portfolio continued to be stable demonstrating the strength of our prime revolver customer base our private student loan portfolio had another quarter of strong credit performance with net chargeoffs down basis points compared to the prior year excluding purchased loans the 30plus delinquency rate improved basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially credit performance in our personal loan portfolio continued to be very strong this quarter reflecting our disciplined underwriting and the benefit of credit actions implemented over the past several years net chargeoffs improved basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points from the prior year while overall credit performance remained strong through the third quarter we expect the economic environment to lead to deterioration in consumer credit with delinquencies likely increasing in the timing of the rise in discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 delinquency and subsequent losses could be impacted if there is a second government stimulus program or economic trends shift materially slide shows our allowance for credit losses in the quarter we added million to the allowance driven by a million increase in organic student loans other loan products were generally flat from the prior quarter with the backdrop of an uncertain but improving macroeconomic environment we modeled several different scenarios and maintained a conservative view in the quarter our key macro assumptions were an unemployment rate of at the end of and slowly recovering over the next several years we also consider the current trends in unemployment and the increasing number of covid cases moving to slide our common equity tier ratio increased basis points sequentially primarily due to the decline in loan balance in march we suspended our share buyback program in response to the economic environment at that time and it remains suspended we have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at per share we are in the process of preparing our second stress test submission and will determine our share repurchase and dividend actions subject to the final stress capital buffer regulatory and rating agency expectations and board approval in summary solid results in the third quarter the portfolio remained stable with improvements in overall delinquency levels reserves were flat except for those pertaining to student loans where the balance and commitment levels increased net interest margin improved from the second quarter and is trending positively as a result of our aggressive deposit pricing and finally strong execution on our targeted expense reductions with that ill turn the call back to our operator maria to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of sanjay sakhrani of kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning and good quarter appreciate all the color on reserves and provisions roger clearly theres nothing that we see within the credit metrics that suggests weakness outside of the headlines on potential whitecollar layoffs are there any specific signs that youre seeing inside the portfolio that leads you to be concerned and how significant the change in the environment would there have to be for you guys to have to build reserves again roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so ill let john cover the part about reserves sanjay but in terms of the environment i think the jobless claims numbers and well see what this week has but seven straight weeks over and more and more of that permanent unemployment and whitecollar is a reason for ongoing concern but i think as you look at our portfolio i am very pleased with the performance across all products and you can see that from the broadest metric we disclosed the 30day delinquency rate john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah and sanjay in terms of reserving we modeled a number of different assumptions and took a conservative approach across the board what we saw was actually as roger said excellent underlying portfolio performance there is that level of concern in terms of jobless claims and the impact on prime consumers but to date we dont see anything thats out there that would suggest that reserves are ill say weak or deep strengthening at this point we did model a second round of stimulus we dont know if thats going to happen theres some reason to be optimistic but no one can tell on these sorts of things these days so well see but well look at it through the quarter the fourth quarter and make the call in terms of whats appropriate from a gaap standpoint sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rick shane of jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys and good morning look were entering whats historically the most important part of the year in terms of spending and consumer behavior im curious two things youre seeing an uptick in spending which is a good sign im curious how you will approach this from a marketing and rewards perspective we know you pulled discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 back a little bit to this point to manage expenses but given the consumer seems to be rebounding will you be a little bit more aggressive on rewards or marketing as we head into the holiday season roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thanks rick in terms of marketing while we did cut expenses in line with the economic environment we have continued to market across all of our products and have been very excited actually about the quality of new accounts were bringing in on the card book as well as some of the costs were seeing as competitors pulled back more aggressively now i do expect some of that to normalize over time but again were going to continue marketing through the fourth quarter in terms of the rewards program our program is well suited to this environment consumers prefer cash over miles i think a lot of the miles programs i see in the marketplace are struggling to add relevance in redemption options in particular our strong partnerships with paypal and amazon some of the programs were already putting in market with amazon will serve us well in the fourth quarter richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thats very helpful thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of don fandetti of wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning so roger i mean these are the times where you can potentially step in and gain share and be opportunistic we saw american express buy kabbage do you have any thoughts on your position of strength how you could use that maybe on acquisitions or are you going to just sort of hold tight given the uncertainty roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think we are leveraging that position of strength i believe were gaining share both in terms of sales and loans and card and had a very strong peak season for student loans acquisitions are a little more challenging and so as we think about how we use capital the top priority is supporting organic growth next comes a mix of dividends and buybacks acquisitions tend to be a distant third our primary interest is in the payment space but while valuations have come in a bit especially where cross border type companies theyre still very high and so a lot of what were seeing are opportunities for either investments partnerships so well look at it but i think were probably more likely to be aggressive on the organic side subject to our conservative credit policy than making acquisitions donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and just one quick clarification what percentage of the portfolio is promo right now because it sounds like thats going to help on the card yield going forward discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes its come down recently weve been intentional about that in terms of taking a look at promo balances as well as balance transfers so donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so where does that stand i think usually you guys are in the midteens or somewhere in that range john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah its right around or so donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thanks a lot john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services trending down operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning roger and john its encouraging to see positive operating leverage in this environment thats consistent with what weve seen over the last decade plus from you guys but there had been some concern among investors when you guys gave guidance earlier this year precovid that discover may have lost its expense discipline and thats the reason that you guys had at the time guided to negative operating leverage was due to years of chronic underinvestment roger understanding that there will always be oneoff investments that need to be made but that aside can you speak to your confidence level in being able to continue to generate consistent positive operating leverage as we look to the other side of this roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah thanks bill so first having been here for over years i have to maybe disagree with the phrase chronic underinvestment i think our investments have been appropriate but at the beginning of the year we saw an opportunity to invest more and so i would characterize it that way clearly the year changed dramatically and hopefully youve seen very strong expense discipline in terms of the target we put out there and how well were progressing against that target its a little challenging just to look at operating leverage because that includes what ill call sort of daytoday corporate type expenses that were always trying to bring down but then discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 also marketing investments to drive profitable growth and highreturning accounts and so its a blend of those two but again i think you can expect to see the continued expense discipline that i think has always been a hallmark here at discover our overall lower cost operating model but we will invest according to the opportunities we see in the marketplace and i guess id point to the returns were generating as an example of the effectiveness of that business model even through extremely challenging cycles bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of ryan nash of goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning ryan john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc john on the net interest margin you saw some really nice expansion you talked about the benefits that youre seeing from lower promo activity can you maybe just talk about some of the puts and takes from here asset yields are obviously going to be improving and it seems like the funding tailwinds are sizable over the next couple of quarters so if we had peaked out in the low2 could we actually potentially see the margins somewhere in excess of that over the next few quarters john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we were mindful in terms of what we included here in the presentation as well as in terms of the comments to provide frankly an additional insight in terms of whats happening to the funding mix the maturity profile and the cost of our debt stack and what you can see there is based on the maturity profile and the cost were seeing versus online deposits that there will be an opportunity to expand net interest margin now thats subject to a lot of different things right obviously theres one piece which is the health of the portfolio and thats been strong certainly the mix of revolvers and transactors will also have an impact and typically impacts the fourth quarter a bit but overall as you look at where we are this quarter i see some upside from that from my vantage point today discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe if i can ask a followup question from a topic that was hit on before so john i think in your prepared remarks you commented that youre looking for additional efficiencies maybe can you just help us understand and maybe roger can hop in on this too of the of the million that youve saved how much of that is just investments that have been deferred versus actual core efficiencies that you guys have identified and taken out and what could this mean for the trajectory of the cost base outside of marketing as we look into thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so thanks so i would characterize it this way is the million of cost savings from the previous guidance i wouldnt necessarily call that a deferral what i would say is we took a look at the economic environment and took million of our planned spending now as i said in the remarks which you clearly picked up on ryan was that the bulk of that has been on marketing and brand now as we look through the balance of this year and some of the actions that we took we saw benefits across a host of pl lines expense lines specifically and were going to use that frankly as a new benchmark in order to really make some determinations on what we need to spend in to ensure that we continue to grow profitably i would say this if the economic environment continues to improve its natural that were going to spend more money on customer acquisition in order to drive profitable growth into the future but the other expense lines professional fees information processing other miscellaneous expense were going to keep a foot on those to ensure that were disciplined about how were spending the dollars ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for all the color operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch of credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks most of my questions have been asked and answered but i guess i sort of am struck by the fact that the efficiency ratio in the quarter was actually better than it was in and youre kind of demonstrating certainly likely to be the best growth in spend volume and one of the better growths if not the best in receivables or smallest decline and i guess im also struck by stuff we see in the industry that theres continued more cash back mail from some of your big competitors where that wasnt as big a focus and so kind of maybe some of this has been discussed already but im sort of struck by that it seems like you have an opportunity and where does where can you direct that attention and how much do you have in kind of available whether its spending on rewards or marketing like what are the tools and how are you going to use them over the next few quarters particularly now as were going into the holiday season thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 yeah thanks moshe were using all the tools we have available i would point out there still is a good amount of economic uncertainty and so we are not changing credit policy on the card side i think we want to see more and more signs of sustained recovery but the cashback program is resonating well as i said earlier and theres always a lot of competition in cash rewards from major issuers so i wouldnt necessarily characterize it as more intense than ever but it is a time where consumers are rethinking which cards they want do they really need another frequent flyer mile at this point and then the other part is the only major issuer with no fees on any of our card products but knowing a fee message resonates surprisingly well and then finally id point you were seeing great strength on the other side of the balance sheet on the deposit side where we compete the same way right good value but an outstanding customer experience so were really excited certainly uncertainty as to what the holiday season will bring as i talk to retailers out there but i feel good about our ability to continue to gain share moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc thanks very much operator our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good morning id just like to follow up on some of the nim comments i mean youre seeing some a little bit more resiliency on the asset yields in particular some of the personal loans and card rates could you talk about the competitive environment in both of those products and your expectations for those yields at least in the next couple of quarters just given the resiliency that weve seen in the near term john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we look at the card yields theyll overall be relatively stable subject to kind of the mix of balance transfers and promos and as i said earlier were going to be mindful in terms of those sorts of decisions if we can do that do some promos or balance transfers safely in a credit environment well do that because it would be highreturning customers but the leverage that were going to get in future quarters will come out of the funding base roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and kevin maybe one thing id add too as we set pricing given how hard it is to reprice cards after the card act were not reacting to specific competitors in a given quarter were working closely with finance a very disciplined through the cycle look and so its really where our growth is occurring and that promo mix that will drive it as opposed to reacting to competitors kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 yeah that all makes sense and then regarding the liability side the order of magnitude in the drop and liability costs over the last couple quarters are obviously very strong just given the rate environment i mean how much more room do you feel like you have to bring deposit costs lower just given the current rate environment and the outsized amount of liquidity on your balance sheet john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we continue to look at that and the decision would be subject to two factors one the amount of liquidity we have on the balance sheet and right now were in a situation where we have excess liquidity and then the second piece of the equation is the competitive landscape and then third which is a consideration of the business is certainly the customer relationships and ensuring that our longterm good quality customers arent feeling like theyre impacted in a way thats unfair now with all that said im seeing a persistent lowrate environment and with a persistent low rate environment i do believe that there is some amount of room to price downward but again its caveated by all those points that i just mentioned kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of bob napoli of william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc yeah thank you and good morning just wondered what youve built into your reserves as far as the trajectory of chargeoffs and i would expect i mean i guess youre not really given where delinquencies are youre not expecting to see chargeoffs move up much in the fourth quarter and then more backhalf weighted to john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so i would start off by stating that the portfolio performance versus what we thought it potentially could be when we closed the book in march has been extraordinarily strong and were really really pleased by that in terms of trajectory of both delinquencies and chargeoffs yeah we are seeing certainly a push from into and the absolute quantum of that will obviously depend on all the factors that we built into our reserve calculation gdp unemployment new jobless claims stimulus or lack thereof so were going to monitor the portfolio but just to kind of net it for you and the other folks on the call looks super solid level of uncertainty and we expect the bubble to push through into certainly beginning maybe in the midpoint of the year into the second half of robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc got it thank you and then a followup just the jobless claims this morning a big improvement but ridiculously high report of that sort discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc but i mean direct bank your position roger as a direct bank i think is the right strategy for the long term are there new products or services that youre planning to build through that direct bank i mean we have obviously a lot of these neobanks that are delivering different products and maybe to a different demographic than discover focuses on but where do you see opportunities to leverage off of your direct bank strategy roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so in terms of positioning ourselves as the leading digital bank i think were in great shape and its leveraging the products we already have i dont see the need for expanding our products if you look at the breadth from home equity to a broad range of deposit products including checking or debit accounts great strength of course on the card side personal loans so we have the products i think the opportunity is building awareness of the products we have and that can drive a lot of growth so im very excited about where were positioned id say maybe one of the big differences versus the neobanks is perhaps a different focus around profitability so well see how that plays out over the long term but i couldnt be more excited about where were positioned robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you appreciate it operator our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia of bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning thank you for taking my question first i just wanted to clarify did i hear correctly you said you have modeled a second round of stimulus in your modeling for credit john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yes we did there is an input in our modeling reflecting a second round of stimulus mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch understood okay and then just one quick one on the i was hoping to get a little bit of an update more on the network business specifically i was looking at it looks like your volumes are growing pretty nicely in both pulse and network partners but yet as you attributed the revenue declined in both those businesses so i was just wondering what is happening there is it just competitive factors is there a mix issue just hoping to get a little more color there thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks for the question so it was actually a combination of two things so there was a bit of a mix shift to some products with lower fees and rates there was also some higher incentives that came through based on the mix that we enjoyed in the quarter i would say that in terms of overall volume it was up yearoveryear at least for pulse and certainly we are happy about that we are continuing to look at the mix and incentives to ensure were driving appropriate level of profitability for the investments were making there in the payments business mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america merrill lynch right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning betsy john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc couple questions just first off on the outlook for growth i know typically its a function of account growth and balances per account and obviously youve had some shrinkage recently because of the spend levels that we all know about im just wondering if we could dig into the account growth aspect of that equation just to understand how account growth has been going what covid has meant to account growth how you flexed and do you see any opportunity to accelerate account growth from here as we go into the back half of the year and into thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so just one thing on the receivables growth the higher payment rate is a big factor as well so good news on what its doing on the deposit side of our business but that is having a significant impact on loan growth for both card and personal loans in terms of new accounts while we dont disclose a number on that what i would say is that we think weve probably sustained new account marketing more than a lot of competitors as i look at industry metrics and so we feel good about that and kept our marketing spend sort of appropriate for the environment and for our discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 somewhat narrowed credit box with the changes we made earlier in the year so i would not expect dramatic changes until we get more certainty in terms of the pace of recovery but weve continued to market across all of our products betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay so youve been pleased with your account growth that youve generated over the past couple of quarters thats what im hearing from you roger is that right roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah and in particular i think we called out on the last call some of the cost per account that we were seeing in different channels as competitors pulled back more betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right okay and then just separately on credit and the outlook for credit here one of the questions is around stimulus and if you dont get it how much does that impact potential changes in the reserve and then the other piece is on the mortgage forbearance i think i believe a majority of your customers have mortgages and im wondering if you know through credit data checks how many of those people are benefiting today from the mortgage forbearance and does that feed into your reserve analysis as well thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay yeah so look ill talk about the credit outlook and then handle the mortgage question on the back end so in terms of the stimulus that we modeled in it is one of many inputs and well look at what happens in the fourth quarter and see how the roll rates are progressing in the portfolio through the quarter to get ill say a bottomsup view of actually the impact there so no specific information on that other than to say that underlying roll rates are far more positive than we thought they would be at this time and if another round of stimulus doesnt come in i think thats going to be tough for a number of people that have been impacted by the pandemic and progressively it will start to impact the prime revolver base and thats why were conservative in terms of our reserve outlook here for the third quarter but overall again were pleased with our positioning now in terms of the mortgage forbearance actually we really dont have any data on that what we are seeing is our home equity business continues to its open for business our underwriting standards have tightened mildly through this and its positioned pretty well and open for business betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks john appreciate the color john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 operator our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great good morning thanks for taking my call i wanted to take a look at capital trends and buybacks and i know that you guys are in the midst of preparing your second stress test submission but i was wondering in terms of timing as to when you would get a better sense of the economy in order to possibly execute the buybacks one more time is it in the back half of more into just any thoughts on when you guys feel you would have more clarity in terms of the economy in order to reinstate that buyback program thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great thanks for the question so were submitting our second round of stress test in november and included in there are a number of judgments im not going to get into any of the details itd be premature on that i would say as you take a look at the capital trends for the business theyre super solid our capital levels are higher than our targeted levels and roger was specific in terms of our tiering of capital allocation priorities so theres no change to that and were going to work through kind of the details with the fed other regulators rating agency and then our board sorry i cant be more specific than that at this point craig a streem a vice presidentinvestor relations discover financial services maria next question operator our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks just wanted to drill down a little bit further on the funding tailwinds could you give us a better sense of kind of what mix youre targeting between the dtc and affinity deposits and the brokered is there a minimum level of brokered that you want to maintain and also kind of whats the funding difference between those two just to give us a sense of how much your deposit funding on average could compress john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we want to keep the brokered cd channel open so well continue to kind of test that the relative change or difference between the directtoconsumer and the brokered deposits narrowed significantly in the early stages of the pandemic there was a substantial difference and the market took care of that and narrowed the gap we do enjoy a slightly better pricing if its a direct relationship versus through a broker so that will be our focus in terms of overall kind of mix of those i would expect the broker channel to continue to contract a bit and the direct channel expand mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 okay with such a low funding on the abs why not maintain that or expand it are there like liquidity concerns of having assets unencumbered that youre managing to or is there something else im not thinking about john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah no the cost there on the abs thats reflected is net of the hedge impact so fortunately we hedged those and have a nice benefit coming through over the next couple of years the actual ill say contract rate on those abs transactions quite a bit higher than that so that would frankly that was the rates were enjoying there is just good work on the part of our treasury team to hedge that so well continue to ensure that the abs channel is there and present and available to us but it will certainly come down as maturities profile indicates mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay got it thank you operator our next question comes from the line of dominick gabriele of oppenheimer dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc hi good morning thanks so much for taking my question i just wanted to see if we could kind of square the circle around unemployment and where the unemployment rate is and the kind of liquidity that the consumer has been given up until this day and it sounds like we obviously both agree that delinquencies probably given this liquidity dont even start rising until the first of the year and so when you think about your expectation for unemployment at by yearend and where we are and the idea of a whitecollar rush of unemployment that would be quite the rush of whitecollar unemployment versus the amount of people that are unemployed now versus a steady state and so can you just talk about where the perhaps the job losses come from and why such a large magnitude of whitecollar versus still unemployed call it bluecollar that we saw now and how thats influencing your outlook for the unemployment rate thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks dominick so you touched on a lot there and i would sum it up by saying theres a level of uncertainty around what actually will happen on unemployment now the does feel at this point like a ill call it a robust number but what were trying to get a good clarity on is as the service workers who initially were impacted by the pandemic containment activity went to the unemployment ranks some of those have returned we certainly have seen some indications across the economy that across the nation and frankly the world that it could be a tough winter here from a covid standpoint so thats going to further impact not only service industry but the entire economy and so as we sit here today were mindful of that as a risk and continue to kind of maintain the reserves where they are so we dont expect there to be a rush of whitecollar unemployment but what will be clear and weve seen some of this already is businesses are sizing both their professional staff and the bluecollar staff for the business at hand and theres enough indications today that there could be some contraction and as such the unemployment numbers not exactly an easy number to predict but we feel like as an input to our model its appropriate at this point discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc great thank you and if i could just have one followup here i really appreciate that and if you look at the other expenses on the expense base it looks like the acceptance incentives came down as well as fraud even though were kind of in this more online environment could you talk about what youre doing on the fraud side and how that was and did you renegotiate any of the global acceptance or is it a function of just volume and mix year overyear versus the third quarter of on how your expense base and other expense came down thanks so much i really appreciate it roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so in terms of fraud it doesnt reflect any renegotiations with any of our merchant partners fraud is one of the areas where were deploying advanced analytics and nextgeneration modeling and leveraging additional information sources so im really excited about the progress the team is making there and its part of why were so committed to continuing to build out our analytics capability john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah and then i would just add in terms of the other expense line so we did see lower global acceptance expense in the quarter and thats a function of two things a little bit on the economy and liability associated with some of our partners executing on kind of terms associated with previous incentive agreements and then frankly just a level of uncertainty thats caused us to be cautious on the ill say signing up new rich incentive deals now were still doing that where it makes sense but in terms of timing a little bit cautious on that one but weve seen actually great effectiveness from our procurement team driving yearoveryear savings on the entire indirect cost base and were still as we said in the remarks investing in advanced analytics and some digital capabilities thats driving up information processing but my expectation is that we continue that we are and we will continue to get more efficient in overall information processing and technology spend dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc great thanks and congrats on the quarter john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services thank you operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you a quick followup on credit there had been a lot of consternation around booming credit headwinds in the tdr portfolio can you discuss how thats been performing discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so thanks for the question bill so you folks dont have the tdr disclosures but theyll come out in the q when its published and what youll see there is relative to the first quarter tdr volumes will be substantially down but there is also the impact of the cares act with a regulatory exclusion for certain modifications that banks such as ours make so if you put those two together and compare where we are in the third quarter versus where we were in the first quarter and call the first quarter prepandemic relatively stable so the point there is that theres not an abundance of activities or a massive jump in any sorts of activities there thats impacting delinquencies we do these programs to improve the cash flows of the company and ensure that when theres a temporary issue with a customer that they can manage through it and return to paying their bills so from a kind of credit standpoint tdr standpoint theres been good execution from our customer service teams bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thanks john operator and ladies and gentlemen that was our final question id like to turn the floor back over to craig streem
