our trust preferred securities these actions evidence the strength of our capital position which allows us to return capital to our shareholders while we continue to invest in our franchise please turn to slide our annual net income of million reflects an increase of million above our annual net income of million the increase was largely driven by lower provision expense higher fees and higher

year please turn to slide our quarterly net income of million was million lower than the third quarter and million higher than the same quarter of the sequential variance was driven by a lower benefit in the provision for credit losses higher expenses and lower fee income partially offset by higher net interest income loan growth was solid in the quarter particularly in popular bank with some commercial loans increased by our margins continued to be impacted by the low rate environment and our asset mix however we are encouraged with the margin expansion and the us business credit quality

quarter we continue to be optimistic about the prospects for the future yet will remain attentive to how the evolving health situation may impact the economy and ill turn the call over to carlos for more details on our financial results carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning before we turn to the fourth quarter results let me expand on populars full year performance which is included in the appendix to this presentation and todays press release our net interest income increased by yearoveryear to billion due to the growth in earning assets in we reported a provision benefit of million compared to a provision expense of million in the provision benefit was driven by the current recovery the continued strength of economic projections and low levels of chargeoffs noninterest income increased by yearoveryear with most segments higher in versus operating expenses increased for the year to billion higher personnel technology and regulatory costs were the primary drivers our capital position is robust we ended the year with a tangible book value increasing by more than per share to notwithstanding the repurchase of million of common stock please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the third quarter net interest income for the fourth quarter was million an increase of million from q3 noninterest income decreased by million to million in q4 the impact of two items in q3 contributed to these results a million gain associated with the sale of two corporate office buildings and income from investments held under the equity method that are million lower in q4 these negative variances were partially offset by million higher seasonal contingent insurance commissions and million higher credit card fees going forward we expect that the average quarterly level of noninterest income will be around million to million the provision for the fourth quarter was a benefit of million this was million lower than the benefit recorded in the third quarter total operating expenses were million in the quarter an increase of million from q3 this increased price was impacted by higher employee compensation caused by million mostly driven by salary increases higher incentives and commissions equipment expense up by million and seasonal business promotion expenses up by million including million higher credit card rewards expense popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 other operating expenses increased by million due to higher sundry losses by million which includes million related to the termination of a white label credit card contract and high impairment losses on undeveloped properties of million also amortization of intangibles rose by million due to the writedown of a trademark excluded million of impairments and writedowns just mentioned our expenses would have been within our prior guidance for q4 for we expect average quarterly expenses to be around million the increase from is driven by higher expenses in the following categories firstly now as we continue to invest in training and compensation with the related benefit cost also increasing this is driven by a tight labor market in puerto rico and in the regions where we operate in the mainland technology as we continue to modernize our digital capabilities pure obsolescence and address regulatory cyber and compliance needs and finally business promotion especially in expenses related to reward programs for our clients some of these higher technology and reward expenses are related to our expectation of higher levels of client activity obviously we will strive to come in below this expected level of expenses our effective tax rate for the quarter was and for the full year was in we expect the effective tax rate to be between and a higher tax rate in was related to the tax effect of the provision releases during the year please turn to slide net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis was million million higher than the third quarter the increase in noninterest income on a taxable equivalent basis was mainly related to the repayment of pcd loans and higher ppp fees as one of the activity recognized in the quarter from our recently acquired lease financing business deposits grew by billion in the quarter the growth was in bppr with a million increase in our retail and commercial deposits and a million increase in public deposits net interest margin was essentially flat the total loan yield increased by basis points in q4 again mostly on ppp fees and repayment of pcd loans ppp loans yielded in this quarter compared to in q3 due to higher accelerated recognition of fee income of our forgiveness in we recognized million in income from this program the outstanding yearend balance of ppp loans is million the remaining unamortized portion of fees for this portfolio is approximately million which we expect to recognize during the first half of as of the end of the fourth quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion given the approval of the plan of adjustment we anticipate that approximately billion to billion of public deposits will leave the bank by the end of the first quarter or early in the second quarter this will reduce loan yielding assets on our balance sheet as of every billion decrease in public deposits would have increased our net interest margin by to basis points its important to reiterate that this anticipated outflow of deposits will not be a liquidity event for the bank as by loaning puerto rico these deposits must be collateralized we continue to be asset sensitive due to our large cash position driven by elevated public deposit balances even with the expected outflow of some indiscernible deposit we will continue being asset sensitive as of december each basis points change in fed funds would correspond to a million to million change in net interest income per quarter our ending loan balances increased by million in the quarter this increase occurred despite million decrease in ppp loans excluding the impact of ppp loan balances grew by million in q4 reflecting higher commercial loan balances of popular bank and to a lesser extent higher auto personal credit card and commercial balances in puerto rico the increase in the us included the acquisition of k2 which added million in loans these balance increases were of same part by lower construction balances both in the us and puerto rico as well as continued trend like runoff in the mortgage portfolio in puerto rico of million we are popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 encouraged by the demand for credit at bppr and already seeing growth in most segments despite these positive trends we do not expect overall loan growth to materialize in puerto rico until the middle of this year when demand resulting from expected economic growth should outpace the forgiveness of ppp loans and the mortgage runoff please turn to slide capital levels remain strong our common equity tier1 ratio in q4 was flat with q3 tangible book value decreased in the quarter by approximately to primarily driven by the higher accumulated unrealized losses on investments our return on tangible equity was in the fourth quarter to review our capital action last year we repurchased million in common stock increased our quarterly dividend by per share to per share redeemed million in high ph cost prefs and finally acquired a national healthcare equipment leasing business for million as ignacio mentioned at the start of todays call our announced capital plan includes two actions first an increase of populars quarterly common dividend by to per share starting q2 secondly we will be executing a common stock repurchase program of up to million while our recent buyback programs have been executed via asr the implementation plan for this buyback is still under consideration we have returned to our normal capital planning schedule which should result in an announcement of populars capital actions no later than our january webcast we will continue to explore opportunities to manage our capital structure during the remaining of and in future periods with that ill turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall popular continued to exhibit strong credit quality trend and low credit costs with net recovery and decreasing nonperforming loans we continue to closely monitor covid19 pandemicrelated risk on borrower performance and changes in the pace of economic recovery as new variants continue to emerge however were optimistic given recent credit performance economic outlook and improvements in the risk profile of the corporations loan portfolios turning to slide number nonperforming assets decreased by million to million this quarter mainly driven by an npl decrease of million offset in part by an oreo increase of million the decreasing npls was mainly in puerto rico driven by lower commercial npls of million primarily due to payoffs and paydowns related to troubled loan resolution also contributing to the decrease were loans that returned to accrual status during the quarter coupled with lower mortgage npls of million and lower construction npls of million in the us npls increased by million mainly due to mortgage loans that did not resume payment at the end of the pandemic deferral period yearoveryear npls decreased by million or mostly in puerto rico due to improvements in economic performance compared to the third quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans increased by million driven by an increase of million in the us due to the higher mortgage inflows as discussed before offset by lower commercial and mortgage npl inflows in puerto rico the oreo increase in the quarter was driven by the resumption of foreclosure activity in the puerto rico mortgage portfolio at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans heldinportfolio was compared to in the previous quarter and in the year ago period turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to a net recovery of million or an annualized negative basis points of average loans heldinportfolio compared to million or basis points in the previous quarter popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 the variance in net chargeoff was mainly driven by the resolution of the previously mentioned commercial non performing loans for the year the net chargeoff ratio improved by basis points from basis points in to basis point this year driven by improvements in both regions across all major loan categories the corporation allowance for credit losses decreased by million to million driven mainly by improving credit quality improvements in mortgagerelated industries and indiscernible values coupled with releases from our qualitative reserves the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans heldinportfolio decreased slightly to from in the third quarter and is down from as of cecl day the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls heldinportfolio was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses was a benefit of million compared to a benefit of million in the previous quarter please turn to slide number the variance in allowance for credit losses was driven by changes to qualitative reserves and economic outlook as well as portfolio credit quality and mix offset in part by changes in economic scenario indiscernible during the quarter we released million from our qualitative reserves prompted by the economic environment and improvements in borrower performance portfolio changes driven mainly by credit quality and volume mix caused the acl to decrease by million this quarter in response to uncertainty caused by omicron and the setback in president bidens build back better plan we increased the pessimistic scenario weight which contributed to an increase of million in reserves however the macroeconomic scenarios from puerto rico and the us continue to show a positive outlook for the economy to summarize our loan portfolio exhibited strong credit quality metrics with net recoveries in the chargeoffs and decreasing nonperforming loans were optimistic given recent credit performance economic outlook and improvements in the risk profile of the operations loan portfolio with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates was an outstanding year for popular driven by record earnings improved credit quality record deposit levels continued customer growth and the successful execution of our capital actions we are optimistic about the economic outlook in addition to the unprecedented level of federal stimulus related to covid puerto rico still has a significant amount of hurricane recovery funds that have yet to be disbursed but have now begun to flow at a faster pace the combined impact of these factors along with the continued progress on the resolution of puerto ricos fiscal issues should generate considerable economic activity in many sectors for the coming years and we are wellpositioned to benefit from such activity im very proud to report that both bppr and popular bank each now offer bank oncertified deposit accounts bank oncertified accounts were created by the cities for financial empowerment fund a national nonprofit organization to promote financial inclusion for underbanked and unbanked consumers through standard account features that ensure low costs while offering robust transactions capabilities in puerto rico we are the only bank that is currently offering a bank on

members of our community that have for numerous reasons remained outside the traditional banking system we are also proud to have been included in this years bloomberg genderequality index as we will

values inclusion respect and accountability doesnt just make us a better employer it makes us a stronger organization and last but certainly not least id like to thank our entire team for their patience and resilience in helping us achieve our record results it goes without saying that our employees continue to be our greatest source of strength we are now ready for your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question today comes from brett rabatin from hovde group brett your line is open brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning brett ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc i wanted to first ask congrats on the loan growth in the us bank and that changed the tonner on the path of loan portfolio can you talk may be a little bit about the continued momentum if possible on the us side and k2 and if the trends we saw in the fourth quarter if that might continue to translate during and if the puerto rico bank starts to maybe have stronger trends as well that kind of contributes to a better trend for positive net growth and maybe were thinking a quarter or so ago ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc brett yeah i think the fourth quarter was actually a great quarter for the us operation but it did follow to be a slower third quarter so i would have projected the fourth quarter would be the normal rate of growth but we are anticipating solid growth in the us and puerto rico i think weve been very consistent of saying were starting to see loan demand pick up and we continue to see that and as carlos mentioned in his remarks we expect that by the second half of the year that loan growth in puerto rico will outpace our mortgage runoff and our ppp repayment so we continue to be optimistic but i think i wouldnt project the fourth quarter us as their run rate but they have a strong book and i think were looking forward to that production but i would not project the fourth quarter as a normal rate of growth popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay fair enough and then was the deposit outflow well if i have this right if youre deposits are down billion its marginally up around basis points if i heard you correctly it was basis points per billion of deposits was that the correct number carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc that is correct brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay okay and then on the expense guidance for million would there be a progression during the year of that or is that more of how you kind of view the quarters in general and either theyre kind of flat throughout the year carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc brett there usually is some volatility in our expense our total expenses on the ph fourth quarter basis so they very rarely are flat during the year they sort of tend to go up during the year actually so that is the reason weve described it as million average quarterly for the year it may be that we have a couple of quarters that will be lower and then we may end up with a couple of quarters that will be higher but again there has historically been some seasonality in our expenses as you know it probably will repeat itself this year but were not sure brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay okay and then the last is kind of a housekeeping issue i dont have ive seen a couple of different numbers and so you mentioned the funds disbursed still to come for puerto rico and ive seen a few different numbers and the number i guess ive seen a lot billion would you guys have a better number for the funds that are yet to be disbursed in puerto rico ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah i think i agree that its hard to figure out but if you if you take the fema cdbg you had that the covid relief and then the infrastructure bill we think theres probably between billion to billion left to be disbursed brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc really okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc great thanks for all the color congrats on the quarter ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator our next question comes from brock vandervliet from ubs brock your line is open brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah great thanks emily good morning guys carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc lets see capital return talk about the asr under consideration is that just the timing issue where its technically always under consideration at this point or might you really do a different structure there and secondly can you talk about whether its refinancing sub debt or other items kind of other organic uses of capital carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc right on your first question we have as i mentioned used asr in the last few years but we have no predecision made every year we actually sit down and we look at the market and we look at what we think is going to happen and consider all the alternatives so the real answer to your question is an all alternative to execute the buyback are still open and as soon as we make a decision we will let the market know but at this point in time all alternatives are open on your second question yeah as i mentioned in the prepared remarks i mean well look at opportunities into the rest of the year and next year and again if we make any decisions or when we make any decisions we will probably announce them to the market popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and separately on the noninterest revenue guide million to million if i cut that correctly that looks just a bit below your current run rate and especially showing momentum on the fee side just wanted to dig in that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah the run rate has been a bit higher but if you break down the summation of all those lines of fees brock for the last couple of quarters theres been a number of things in those quarters are unusual so my commentary was more directed to sort of the run rate of the normal fees as opposed to trying to incorporate unused items in it brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay but carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc it has been a bit higher in the last two quarters youre correct brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it and if any of that guidance due to elimination of ph ncf fees thats a constant question i get carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc as every other bank is i guess we are in the process of concluding our analysis of all overdraft and overdraft fees theres a lot of lines that are wrongly described as overdraft fees that are not necessarily the same activities by the client so were in the process of going through and analyzing what our personal practices are and what we could make sense we have not concluded that analysis but what i can tell you is that in our case the summation of all those fees is about million a year and of course not all those lines of fees will be affected because some of those people will continue moving forward but we havent concluded our analysis yet brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks for the questions carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 operator next question comes from ph tima brazilla from wells fargo ph tima your line is open q hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning q hi maybe just circling back on expenses maybe another way of asking that question so you pointed to a personnel expense technology and business promotions activity in driving that average rate higher i guess of the planned personnel technology and business promotion spend how much already is accomplished and maybe give a timeline as to some of the bigger projects that are slated to come online during carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean our expense lines tend to be rather volatile so thats one of the reasons we have shied away from giving guidance on a per line basis and we keep our guidance on the aggregate expense level what i can tell you is that a significant part of the increase will be in the personnel line as were seeing very real pressure on competitive pressure on the personnel side as weve made public for example at the beginning of this year we increased our minimum wage in puerto rico from to an hour so that will obviously affect the full year we also increased our minimum wage in the virgin islands and in both of our us markets so that is a big part of it the technology one is broken up in our expense lines in a whole bunch of different lines its a little bit unusual for us in our case about the technology expense in personnel or professional fees because our relationship with evertec with the equipment lines so theyre broken up all over the expense lines and again thats one of the reasons we try to stay away from line by line guidance however give you general guidance q okay thank you for that and then maybe looking at the residential runoff of the puerto rico book there it looks like the pace of runoff slowed in the fourth quarter a little bit i guess whats your expectation with higher interest rates to the pace of refi activity and could we actually get kind of normalization and stability in the indiscernible book sooner than expected with the help of rates carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 i mean youre right the runoff rate was slightly lower i think it was around million or something like that in the third quarter as million this quarter i would expect with rates going up the runoff rate may slow down somewhat yes but even in an environment where rates werent changing as much the runoff rate was still million million a quarter so yes it could become lower than million im not sure if its going to become immensely smaller than million million but with higher rates it should become smaller yes q okay thank you and then just lastly from me maybe a bigger picture question can you just provide us with an update on the evertec situation and kind of whats your ongoing plan is with that investment could we see something in the near term or are you really reluctant to do much with that i think the service agreement runs until if im not mistaken are you likely to do something prior to that or do you want to go through that process first before making any decisions ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah we have three and a half years to go on that obviously we would try to reach an arrangement with evertec before the end of the period for the benefit of both going forward but still its too early to say much more than that q understood okay thank you operator our next question comes from alex twerdahl from piper sandler alex your line is open alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co hey first off i just wanted to clarify carlos your comments on the rate sensitivity the million to million per hike per quarter which is definitely above what you saw coming down that just assumes the static balance sheet correct popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc correct yes alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay so then just dig in a little bit more into that if we do get some loan growth later in this year which were all very much hoping for can you just remind us what kind of the new loan yields are that youd be deploying cash at if that growth comes in the various categories carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well it will depend on the mix alex i think the best thing you can do is look at the years which weve closed every one of the different business lines in the press release and start thinking about that and hopefully rates go up some of the businesses may do a little bit better but it is hard because if we end up for example indiscernible a lot more higher fico credit card higher fico auto loans then the yield may not go up even though market rates are going up simply because the risk profile is changing alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay but in terms of the sort of the expected yields that youd see unlike a commercial loan today those are pretty close to that sort of range that were seeing on the average balance sheet carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean if we actually look at the yields in our loan books they dont move as much as market rates do theyre being a little lower so theyre probably going to be around that ballpark again the thing that could swing it is the big change of mix though if we end up doing bigger loans in different sectors or something alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then in the past youve been hesitant to deploy carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc by the way alex one more thing about onethird of the book is floating rate so alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co onethird of the commercial book or onethird of the total portfolio carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc the total portfolio popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then in the past youve been hesitant to deploy liquidity to securities just given where the tenure was and were up about basis points since we last had this conversation i know you did some purchases in the fourth quarter can you give us some color on the timing and what you actually deployed in terms of liquidity in the fourth quarter and then kind of how your outlook is from here in terms of security purchases early in carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yes as you know for the last i think four quarters weve been moving cash into the securities portfolio every one of the last four quarters the increase in the fourth quarter was about million roughly ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc a bit more carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc a bit more so its something that we have been doing for the last few quarters as we found rates a little bit more interesting this is literally a decision that we make in our weekly alco committee and we have a very capable treasurer whose job it is to do that business for us so well keep looking at alternatives to the extent that rates continue to go up and are more attractive we will be our probability that we will redeploy cash will go up but theres no specific plan i can describe to you right now alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay can you give us some color on the carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc do remember that we hold treasury securities in our investment portfolio puerto rico the income from those securities is tax exempt so its important not to forget that alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co yeah and thats an important point but just in terms of what you did in the fourth quarter or that been done late in the quarter or early in the quarter just so we can kind of get a sense for whats already impacted the nii line in the fourth quarter carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc it was done late in the quarter alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 okay and then just switching to loan growth and you talk about some of the maria money coming in and if you drill into some of those programs there is a pretty large component especially some of the cdbg money that really requires bank funding i was just wondering if you can give us an update on kind of what that pipeline could look like i heard from another bank down there that that a lot of those applications that theres a huge number of applications for some of the programs that are kind of awaiting government approval at this point and maybe you can just give us a little bit of color on sort of what that process is like and when you could actually see some disbursements for those types of loans and hopefully whether or not its in ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah its a kind of a complex answer because its a complex situation we have different sources of funds right so you get the fema funds youve got the cdbg fund youve got covid relief money and now you have the infrastructure i think the cdbg has gone through a process requesting proposals and theyre pretty advanced a lot of people have filed proposals and theyre in the process of analyzing them so what i would expect that by the end of the year its a process right because the proposal is going to approve and you have to get the plan the permit but the money is starting to flow not as in the massive amounts what theyre submitting but money is starting to flow especially the covid relief funds had very few restrictions so that money youre seeing already in indiscernible and things like that on a lesser extent i think the cdbg will begin to flow this year certain of their programs and fema goes at a slower pace but its also moving in the right direction theyve awarded a number of projects now and theyre in the design phase so i think this year wont be the year where the ph sprinkler will be wide open youll see and its hard to predict because im not trying to be elusive it is very hard for everyone to predict how fast these things move theyre beginning to move so i would expect to well see more on this christmas this year the infrastructure bill has a lot of money for highways and roads and bridges also so if i think well begin to see this year especially the second half and next year picking up again and the next year picking up again i mean some of the big big money projects like the rebuild of the energy sector take longer because thats a very complex process where they have to go through the energy board and they have to go to the review process but i think some of the money for housing and for other projects for economic development in the cdbg will start to flow this year alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co right and if you just kind of peel back the onion a little bit on the loan growth guide ppp is obviously going away in the next couple of quarters we know that residential runoff is going to be a persisting issue if we just look at the commercial portfolio just the commercial standalone portfolio in puerto rico which i guess would include commercial real estate and construction would you anticipate that portfolio to grow exclusive of course the ppp over the next couple of quarters and maybe talk a little bit about what the pipeline could look like utilization rates and whether or not you have any construction loans that maybe have been approved but havent really seen disbursements yet ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i wouldnt get into single construction projects our book is big enough but i think as we said before we do expect our portfolio to grow the second half of the year and that we do expect the commercial loan portfolio to grow there have been lines granted for different construction projects those lines the utilization really probably isnt as high as theyve been in the past because for example the ones that are used to build residential units are being sold much faster than in the past and people now are more prudent how they build off so they build in popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 stages so they dont build the whole project at a time they build in stages to get repaid but yeah we expect i think there will be infrastructure projects therell be commercial projects so we do expect loan growth in the commercial sector in the second half were seeing a lot of interest in different things as you know the king of spain was here the other day and they brought a commercial mission a lot of interest from us investors but also we have a lot of spanish investors very interested in different types of projects so again we do think commercial in general is going to see growth in the second half we dont have this particular pipeline because our book is just too big and i think too complex to get there but generally were optimistic and positive in what were seeing in terms of clients coming in carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc actually exppp commercial book indiscernible so were positive in that construction can be a little bit more volatile depending on the project and stage and stuff like that alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co understood and then just one more question that i wanted to make sure you guys address on this call when i look at the press release you guys put out a couple of weeks ago on the capital return cant help but to notice that the language that you put in last years press release about the i think last year you said that that announcement on the buyback was it for the whole year that language missing from this years press release am i reading too much into that or is the door just open for kind of everything at this point we know that were going to have a million buyback and growth really picks up maybe thats all you get this year but if the growth doesnt materialize and you dont see ma as a potential that maybe there could be some more buyback later in the year as other uses of capital either do or dont materialize carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc we stand by what we say alex well continue to indiscernible capital structure the remainder of alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc indiscernible alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co thats it for me thank you thats it for me operator our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc your line is open popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning ignacio good morning carlos ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning gerard carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i have to ask before i ask a real question with being degrees up here im seeing sea snow above the ocean how warm is it down there today ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc its a beautiful day today carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah ph no ladies ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc ph no ladies gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc not so warm but not too warm huh gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc there you go there you go im you today thank you for taking the questions and stuff carlos you talked about the deposits with the government i think you said they totaled billion youre expecting billion to billion to be disbursed to them over the first and second quarters will there be more disbursements later in the year or next year whats the outlook for that the remaining amount popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc i mean they havent concluded all of their transactions okay there are still some restructuring indiscernible lot of companies are pending so there could be some more outflow related to those those are smaller i think when this amount of liquidity moves out the government will finally get back into a normal course of business of running the government so i think the flow of funds will probably get money coming in and coming out will increase as well so i think what was going to happen is that well end up normalizing to some level of balances that were very good in the year as you know it always goes up in the second quarter tax savings come in and then it goes down during the year but as far as we know it might be slightly smaller than the billion thatll be left or billion thatll be left after this but its hard for us to figure out exactly what that new number is going to be because as you know a lot of these accounts were not with us before so we dont have a long history with them there used to be a indiscernible before but so yeah there could be some additional outflows there should not be of this magnitude and we will end up with a more normalized level of probably the buses moving forward again probably less than the net amount of this outflow but exactly where were not sure gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you and then in your slide deck you guys showed the unsecured credit ratings you have and i noticed the sp one is on positive outlook indiscernible theres is a slightly below moodys and fitch do you guys have any idea when they may come out with their determination whether theyre going to reach their credit rating carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc not very clear i am not sure if they will wait till they relook at the government before they relook at the rest of us they dont tend to move very fast gerard so not very clear were very hopeful that these developments will be the catalyst for some changes in our ratings so we are ready to get closer to what we think the company really is but we dont have a clear view or timetable here gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay i think ignacio you talked about the commercial loan growth here in the united states and in your slides as you show that your total deposit costs at popular bank are about basis points which i know thats on an absolute level low relative to history but relative to the current period we ran into your peers it seems to be on the high side any thoughts on whats driving that number and what could happen to that number once the fed starts raising interest rates as theyve suggested theyre going to do in months ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well as you know we had tremendous loan growth so we had to balance our desire to reduce our interest costs with the funding of our loans weve been very successful this year i think we have nine consecutive quarters where we lowered our funding costs obviously if rates go up well have to manage that but remember that part of our strategy in new york especially was to have our commercialled strategy so were orienting our branches more for commercial business where you tend to get more stable deposits so thats a big part of our strategy so far its paying off so raising rates will obviously well have to watch the market as part of our strategy popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 especially in the new york market to go to the commercialled growth was to rely more on commercial deposit and retail deposits which tend to be more volatile gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and i assume the k2 numbers are obviously in those quarterly commercial loan numbers but thinking and i may have missed it i apologize in your response to an earlier question about what drove the commercial loan growth in the us is it middle market commercial real estate is it c9 lending what type of commercial lending drove the core growth in the quarter carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah it is of the growth what i mentioned is about million was just the fact that we had in the company was in the quarter so ex the leasing company was a number in the high ph what drove it was mostly our historic plans of business is healthcare is indiscernible the association of banking and cre which is a typical kind of business we do so in all the lines of it was really growth across the board in our historical businesses that drove the growth gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then just lastly ignacio a lot of positive numbers coming out of puerto rico which you highlighted on the auto sales et cetera can you i dont know if theres any specific numbers you can cite but can you share with us whats going on with the immigration patterns have they reversed yet are folks from puerto rico maybe coming back onto the island or is that not happened yet ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc theres a lot of anecdotal evidence i dont have the net inflows from the airport at hand which we usually use i can tell you that even the fiscal board whos not the most optimistic indiscernible has in their most recent fiscal plan reduced their projected level of declining population so they had it declining about one point something a year and now they have it at and that fact is what were seeing anecdotally we are seeing more people coming back to the island so i think theres no doubt that the migration trends have improved i think one area where we have to work as a society as many other societies have to work is im not so worried about migration anymore because the economics have reversed and i dont believe that the push factors when you talk about migration you talk about the pull and the push i think the push factors in puerto rico are much less now the economy is frankly anybody who wants a job really should be able to get a job in puerto rico i worry more about the birth rate and how we can get the birth rate up because at the end of the day to me that is more important than the migration actually migration will work itself out birth rates are very hard to change but definitely the demographic situation has improved its still challenging but again the only empirical numbers ive seen are the projection in population growth declines which now have improved in the most recent fiscal plan which has been submitted by the board gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great i appreciate the color thank you gentlemen popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator lastly we have a followup question from brock vandervliet from ubs brock please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks its just in terms of the credit quality it seems like credit quality is continuing to improve really across the board how should we think about the appropriate level of reserving and related to that do you think theres something special in capping the net chargeoffs in the past year because this doesnt look like the credit quality of the bank that we used to know it looks like the credit quality of a traditional us bank mainland bank and that would point to or suggest a materially lower reserve over a period of time lidio v soriano a executive vice president and chief risk officer popular inc yeah i think we stated before obviously the allowance is going to continue to be driven by credit quality economic outlook and a chargeoff that we experience over the last two years as we mentioned weve seen significant improvements over what was the traditional choice of rate of indiscernible we used to be in our corridor between basis points to basis points in that was basis points in basis points if that continues to be the case you might see continuous releases of other provision im not sure if i answered your question brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc well close enough so the key is among other things just the continued low net chargeoffs ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes obviously greater development yeah carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc and the forecast remember the forecast is a big part of the equation now brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay all right thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator at this time we have no further questions registered ill now hand back to ignacio alvarez for any concluding remarks popular inc bpop corrected transcript q4 earnings call 27jan2022 ignacio alvarez president chief executive
