financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that im now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you paul and thank you for joining us this morning for the third quarter earnings call as im confident youve already seen third quarter was another fabulous quarter for us last quarter in my introductory comments i tried to list a number of themes that i believe are critical in order to not only understand the financial performance for the quarter but really to better ascertain how the firm should perform going forward despite the varying operating environments we might encounter as a quick reminder those overarching themes that i mentioned last quarter and which i think youll see are interwoven again in this quarters numbers number one managements motivated and incented to alter outcomes given various market conditions as an example we dont just accept the current asset sensitivity or we dont just accept what the current overall market growth rates we set about to alter outcomes based on our actions and initiatives a lot of people are chasing all kinds of interesting metrics like deposit cost betas and i get it but specifically the outcomes that were motivated and intended to optimize at pinnacle are the level of classified assets ppnr growth and eps growth in the case of annual cash incentive plan and tangible book value accretion and rotce in the case of the longterm equity incentive plan and so understanding that will likely help you understand things like why weve accreted tangible book value in a year when many have not number two we enjoy a reputation for having a great culture but our culture isnt just fun and soft up any number of studies have demonstrated statistically valid correlations between a social engagement and important outcomes like reduced associate turnover improved productivity improved profitability better sales outcome and total shareholder returns and nothing is more important in the war for talent and so i think that helps explain things like why we continue to hire record numbers of the best bankers and financial services professionals at a time many are short staffed and suffering lower social engagement and high turnover number three our hiring success over the last several years is the single largest contributor to our balance sheet growth and ongoing momentum it explains where so much of our loan and deposit growth comes from and not only that because of the level of experience of our new hires is equal to or greater than years we believe we can grow assets without sacrificing our commitment to credit quality its much different than those that are trying to grow by increasing the frequency of their call program in fact in greenwich research were at or near the top on virtually every sales and service metric that they typically view as important with one notable exception and thats prospect calling where we are dead last thats just not how we get our business as opposed to forcing rms to make prospect calls in our case long experienced bankers typically move longstanding relationships which we believe over the long haul results in a meaningfully different credit profile and number four bhg is not your typical fintech its ability to attract loans from highquality borrowers with very high yields and get them funded through their proprietary bank auction platform or alternately securitizing them in the secondary market when many cannot continues to result in the kind of income that lets us significantly invest pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 in people to seize all the market opportunities that exist for us while continuing to put up top quartile profitability im not aware of anyone whos been able to invest in their business model to the extent that we have while remaining extremely profitable as ive already alluded we believe metrics like asset quality revenue growth earnings per share and tangible book value accretion result in longterm shareholder returns thats why our incentives are linked to them and thats why we show this dashboard quarter in and quarter out where you can see the relentless upward slope of things like revenues earnings per share and the balance sheet volumes that produce that growth on asset quality weve been living in literally the best of times we fully expect the asset quality metrics to more normalize going forward but you can see that npas and classified assets continue to operate at extraordinary lows as do chargeoffs at just basis points in fact weve been in the top quartile in terms of npas to tier capital and classified assets to tier capital for some time and given the continued reductions on those metrics this quarter id be shocked if we arent there again when were able to construct the peer metrics for the third quarter as most of you know given the very commercial nature of our loan book chargeoffs are generally lumpy we had one of those this quarter which harold will talk more about in a moment but again credit metrics continue to be extraordinary i wont spend much time on the nongaap measures at least not as much time as i usually do because the idea is that virtually all the important growth and earnings metrics are up and to the right generally well exceeding market expectations and painting a picture of whats been a beatandraise story for quite some time as i just mentioned the talent that weve added over the last several years results in extraordinary balance sheet momentum as we did last quarter were again dissecting net loan growth based on the categories noted on the slide to help everyone better understand the source of our growth weve again categorized our growth into four broader segments number one our pure asset generation plays like bhg advocate capital jbb leasing b our strategic market expansions which are not only the geographies like atlanta dc birmingham and so forth but also expansions in the specialty lending groups like franchise and equipment lending c growth from our recruiting over the last years so this is the growth of our newer rms that have been with us for only years or less and that are not included in our strategic expansion markets and then finally d our legacy markets and what they contributed from rms that have been with us more than years so thus far through the first nine months weve experienced eop loan growth annualized between december and september which is inclusive of ppp paydowns which are denoted in red on the slide almost of our billion in net loan growth is from our legacy markets while the rest is primarily from new markets new initiatives and new people weve said that weve said this countless times we think were in many of the best banking markets in the southeast many of you know that for lenders to come to work for us they have to have at least years of experience in our markets and on average its more like years so to characterize all this loan growth as new loans is a little bit of a stretch as these borrowers have been working with our 10yearplus experienced lenders for years the loans are just new to pnfp we get asked frequently about how the new markets and specialties are performing i simply want to get you this information where you can see that were having extraordinary success moving talent and clients to the pinnacle pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 platform for those that struggle with the value the emphasis we place on culture heres just one of the examples of where it pays off putting associates in a position where they can serve their clients well is what enables us to attract the best associates as well as their clients i know everyone is aware that the annual fdic deposit market share information was released in the third quarter here you can see first of all were in great markets as evidenced by the rate of deposit growth in the market and thatll be an important success variable going forward but more importantly weve been able to grow our deposits faster than the market which is just another way of saying weve had great success moving market share many are concerned with the shrinking m2 and the impact that could have on funding and so i would say i dont think we could grow anywhere near the pace that we currently grow if we were unable to take deposit share from these larger more vulnerable banks in our markets harold will comment further on our deposit growth in a minute a couple of slides weve used from time to time what youre looking at here is data from greenwich associates the foremost provider of commercial market research to large banks in the united states virtually all the top banks in the country purchase this same data so i would say its universally accepted by all our primary competitors its based on client responses across our entire footprint meaning businesses with annual sales from million to million in tennessee north carolina south carolina atlanta and roanoke so lets focus on the pinnacle line at the bottom of the small business net promoter chart which is on the top left of the slide you see in the navy blue portion of the bar that of the pinnacle client survey rated us a or a on the question how likely are you to recommend your lead provider to a friend or colleague using a scale of to where means not likely at all and means extremely likely in other words of our clients are highly engaged active promoters trust me thats an extremely unusual level of engagement another rated us a or thats not bad combining the two of our clients rated us or better on a 10point scale but that that gold portion of the bar scoring us a or are referred to as passive because while they generally rate you well theyre not really so fired up as to be vocal advocates for you in the market and then the last the red portion of the bar are detractors meaning they rated you somewhere between and and out beside the bar you see a thats the net promoter score or the number of promoters less the number of detractors as you can see that score is wildly differentiated from all our major competitors in our footprint and not only is that a fabulous net promoter score in the southeast according to greenwich its one of the best in the country and the story is the same only better among middle market businesses on the lower right of the slide where you can see our net promoter score is now you might look at the percentage of detractors for each of our major competitors that red portion on each of their bars and keep in mind the banks are generally listed in market share order so as you can see all the top three banks in our footprint have enormous volumes of detractors and thats the opportunity we have been seizing for some time and expect to continue seizing so if you think about the speed and reliability of our growth which is largely dependent on taking share as opposed to economic loan demand this explains why weve been so successful taking share over the last years why we grew loans on an annualized basis this quarter why we grew core deposits on an annualized basis this quarter and why i believe well continue to produce outsized growth for the foreseeable future pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 and its not just that many of the banks with whom we compete have upset a great number of their clients a large percentage of their clients expressly intend to move some or all of their business away from them in the next months that group the percentage of their clients who have expressly indicated their intent to move is represented by the blue bar and happily more than to any of the major banks with whom we compete a large percent of clients intend to increase their relationship with us meaningfully more my purpose in walking through this is really to tighten the linkage for you between our distinctive culture and the revenue and the eps growth so you dont have to just take a leap of faith that the distinctive culture weve been building here over the last years will mysteriously result in something good you can actually connect the dots with greenwich data reflecting the actual client feedback to better understand the quality and sustainability of our market share and revenue growth so thats the 30000foot view with that ill turn it over to harold for a more indepth review of the quarter harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody as usual we will start with loans the third quarter was another strong loan growth quarter for us with almost linkedquarter eop annualized growth our current pipeline support low doubledigit loan growth going into the fourth quarter which would yield low growth for this year loan yields were up in the third quarter due primarily to rate hikes we anticipate further escalation in loan yields with rate increases in november and december our current planning assumption is for basis points in november and basis points in december since there were 150basispoint hikes during the third quarter weve not gotten the full effect of the third quarter average rates noted on the slide given that and more increases in the fourth quarter we anticipate fourth quarter yields will be up basis points to basis points or so as we sit here at the end of september our loan yields are around weve also talked about loan floors over the last several quarters but were essentially through those so we should capture a larger share of rate increases moving forward the bottom left chart summarizes our loan betas for we tracked each rate hike and what the beta results were for each hike the green bars are estimates as we dont have the full effect of the september rate hike yet and we wont till we get to the november fomc meeting when we will put a stake in the ground and remeasure the september hike of course novemberdecember are based on our current planning assumptions but we feel somewhere around loan beta is a reasonable target for us now on to deposits really pleased to report call it linkedquarter annualized growth in deposits for the third quarter at present our relationship managers are active deposit book protectors as well as outbound deposit seekers so its like weve always said its about shoe leather at pinnacle its about being in the community and finding the funding at a reasonable price we like others did experience some mix shift during the quarter as eop dda balances are down from prior quarter but average dda balances were actually up for the quarter we will keep our fingers crossed that this will hold we are actively building out deposit gathering franchises around hsa community housing associations nonprofits and others where we target specific types of organizations that are net providers of funding and we believe we are making strong headway with these special deposit initiatives more to come as these initiatives continue to grow pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 everybody wants to know about deposit betas the top right chart attempts to show what were currently thinking this chart is constructed similar to the loan chart shown previously our planning assumption is that we think we can hold with a total deposit beta that weve been talking about since earlier in the year for the first 20plus years of our existence our number one objective was developing strategies and tactics around funding our growth we continue to like our chances given the significant investment weve made in both the relationship managers and new markets over the last few years we believe many other banks around the country are reassessing their beta assumption as liquidity has gotten more difficult as to pinnacle we have been steadily investing in our deposit book all year long and believe that our clients appreciate a pricing discipline that is more fair in an upright environment in comparison to what we hear from others hopefully youll not hear this bank leadership ever talk about having too many deposits depositors are just as if not significantly more important than borrowers our belief is that we can and will fund our growth effectively and prudently maintaining the appropriate balance between profitability and growth something we believe we have a track record of accomplishing now the liquidity our liquid assets decreased slightly this quarter but we continue to believe we have ample liquidity to fund our nearterm growth as to investment securities our allocation to bonds is anticipated to be flattish in the fourth quarter as the top left chart reflects with the rate upcycle our gaap nim increased by basis points compared to basis points last quarter so were pleased with this going into the fourth quarter our planning assumption is that our nim will likely top off in the first half of next year assuming rate hikes stall or are minimal in the first half of next year in summary our belief is that we should see another quarter of nim expansion along with increased net interest income in the fourth quarter accordingly we are upping our guidance for net interest income growth to the low percentage growth for the full year over last year as to credit we are again presenting our traditional credit metrics pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well as terry mentioned earlier late in the quarter and into october we had one previously classified ci credit weakened due primarily to an alleged failure of a suppliers defective part that had been installed in the homes of our clients customers we dont believe this was the result of all the economic headwinds that we are all paying so much attention to we recorded a partial chargeoff effective september placed the loan on nonaccrual pending more credit work in spite of this one credit were pleased with where classified assets ended as evidenced by the almost threeyear downward trend in our classified loan totals as well as our past dues which are again at very conservative levels at quarter end our current acl is which again compares to a prececl precovid reserve of basis points at the end of we previously thought our acl for the quarter would have been less than but given the events over the last month or so we believe keeping the acl flattish for us is appropriate right now all of this culminates in a larger provision expense than we anticipated at million we continue to have conversations with borrowers about supply chains labor inflation and how its impacting their businesses we have been and are all about sustainable credit diligence effort with the intent to actively identify any weaknesses in our borrowing base we get many questions about what changes we are implementing as a result of the inflationary economy a few things worth mentioning here we have substantially limited our appetite for new construction whether it be residential or commercial we believe our book is very healthy with strong sponsors but the macro environment gives us a pause as to increasing our asset allocations to this segment our credit officers have increased our pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 due diligence in stress testing particularly around supply chain impact rates and profitability were also increasing our diligence around the traditional metrics of loantovalue debt coverage so on and so forth now on to fees and expenses i wont spend a lot of time on fees or expenses and as always i will speak to bhg in a few minutes third quarter fees are coming off of a record second quarter so the optics are difficult and as a reminder we did note last quarter that we thought we would see decreases in fees in the third quarter all that said we are pleased with the effort our feegenerating units are putting forward service charges are impacted by a change in how we charge nsfs and overdraft fees which we announced in early july we have some reason to believe we will see a rebound in wealth management in the fourth quarter as a result of recent hires excluding bhg and barring any additional downdraft from our other equity investments were believing that we are near floral fee this quarter and that we should see a stronger fourth quarter fee result excluding bhg and the impact of these other equity investments we continue to believe that high singledigit growth for over is still in play as to expenses were increasing our overall total expense run rate to a highteens percentage growth in this increase is attributed to head count growth in the new markets market disruption across our markets which has led to strong recruiting opportunities and the addition of jbb in addition we continue to believe that we should achieve maximum payouts of of target awards for our annual cash incentive plan but its all about recruiting and our success in attracting the best bankers to our franchise which seems to be operating at peak capacity our third quarter noncompensation expense was fairly flat with the second quarter and we believe that the fourth quarter wont be that different from the prior two quarters in conclusion we had a strong hiring quarter in the third quarter which was the reason for the increased salary expense were anticipating another strong quarter of hiring in fourth quarter although we dont anticipate the increase will be as great in the fourth quarter as it was in the third quarter as the capital tangible book value increased to at quarter end up slightly from last quarter our capital ratios remain above wellcapitalized levels we like our tangible common equity ratio that stands at currently we are mindful of our tier capital levels particularly at pinnacle bank in light of our exceptional growth and well be monitoring these levels and the debt markets as we head into the fourth quarter and into aside from that we believe the action weve taken to preserve tangible book value and our tangible capital ratio have served us well and have no plans to alter our tier capital stack via any sort of common or preferred offering now a few comments about bhg before we look at the outlook for the rest of the year bhg had a great quarter in our opinion slightly better than we had anticipated were booking more than million in fee revenues this quarter and have increased our outlook for growth over to more than from a projection of last quarter as the slide indicates bhg had another record quarter on originations spreads have come in slightly lower than last quarter from to as the chart on the bottom left indicates thats more than the amount bhg anticipated at the beginning of the quarter bhg does anticipate that auction platform spreads will come in slightly as rates on the short end continue to rise they anticipate that borrower rate should be approaching by the end of the year with bank buy rates moving into the range pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 as a result we anticipate that spreads will fluctuate within the historical ranges of to or so that said were really pleased with bhgs third quarter as the third quarter again highlights their flexibility as to how they can pivot between the bank network and securitizations to fund their loan growth formally titled as the recourse obligation accrual this slide now titled the accrual for loan substitutions and prepayments which stood at of bhgs sold loan portfolio at september which is more than the accrual at june quarter end as bhg increased its accrual from million to million at september as the blue bars on the bottom right chart show the credit loss portion of recourse losses for the second quarter remain at some of the lowest levels in the past years additionally given the macro environment bhg also increased its onbalance sheet reserve for loan losses to million or of onbalance sheet loans from last quarter given the macro environment we believe bhg will likely increase reserves again going into the fourth quarter and into the quality of bhgs borrowing base in our opinion remains impressive and we believe one of their strongest attributes bhg refreshes its credit score monthly always looking for weaknesses in its borrowing base credit scores were at consistent levels with previous quarters so their borrowers have remained resilient through the cycle thus far as to past due trends past dues greater than days were at at september compared to at june and from a year ago past dues were at at the end of december bhgs consistent monitoring of its portfolio allows it to adjust its origination approvals quickly they have over the past few months adjusted their commercial allocations away from nonmedical practices and on consumer which is about of their business they have adjusted their risk tolerance to the higher credit score borrowers national and regional unemployment forecasts give bhg more confidence that their borrowers should be able to withstand forecasted inflationary increases in a way that allows bhg to better weather this environment than others in their space in comparison to other consumers we believe bhgs borrowers are well paid with average borrower earnings being approximately annually we are comfortable in their credit models and their credit experience bears this out lastly bhg had another great operating quarter in the third quarter as i mentioned during the two previous earnings call this year we believe earnings in the first half of would likely be stronger than the second half as they sent more loans to the bank auction platform in the first half of the year rather than hold loans on their balance sheet as you know the bank auction platform delivers immediate gain on sale income while their securitization network delivers interest income over the life of the loans additionally bhg did accomplish during september a million securitization at an acceptable rate of when as it appears to us other fintech lenders were having to reevaluate their business models given the operating environment bhg was very pleased to be able to get this securitization done just a side note kroll has now rerated bhgs first two issuances such that all tranches for all six prior securitizations are now investmentgrade and the senior class a tranche and all issuances is aaarated we do want to highlight bhgs flexibility as to funding securitization platform spreads have compressed in with the weighted average rate for the most recent issuance at compared to in june and in the first quarter this compression motivates bhg to reconsider selling more loans through its auction platform as its pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 spreads have held up better this year than anticipated the key point is that they have the flexibility to do it in the end overall profitability and balance sheet soundness are the key drivers for bhg as i mentioned earlier bhg has updated their earnings guidance and now estimates about earnings growth over again looking forward some key points id like to reemphasize credit remains consistent with previous quarters but bhg is and will be increasing reserves based on macroeconomic data at least over the next few quarters bhg has been modifying their credit models towards originating less risky assets spread shrinkage may occur with more historic levels as we head into the fourth quarter and production volumes are very strong and we believe they will continue to have strong production going into the fourth quarter and of note is that bhg anticipates at least two to four new funding alternatives to open up in the near term as they seek to broaden their already strong liquidity platform which we also believe is one of their strongest attributes quickly heres an outlook for the remainder of for loans weve increased our outlook to low growth for we have adjusted our rate forecast and now consider a fed funds rate by year end we like you will continue to monitor and modify as necessary but we dont believe any reasonable changes to our current planning assumption will impact our current outlook for materially given that we believe we should see continued improvement in net interest income this year which should result in net interest income growth in the low20 percentage range we still believe increases in hires and other factors should result in expense growth being in the highteens all of this is about well provide more information as to our outlook next quarter last year at this time our concerns were trying to figure out how to put together a plan just to grow earnings we were looking at low singledigit earnings growth rate for and it got no better by the end of the year based on sellside research at the time of our peer group was anticipating negative eps growth in so were pleased with our financial performance thus far as we believe we will ph surely beat our loandeposit revenue ppnr and earnings targets for this year trust us as im primarily speaking to my pinnacle team they were listening in we have started building plans for next year and our goal remains the same top quartile earnings performance no matter what gets thrown at us paul with that ill stop and see if there are any questions pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions and we do have some questions in queue the first question is coming from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan steven your line is live steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so harold first on the noninterestbearing deposits right these went from of total before the pandemic which is before qe to today do you think you can hold that mix at about that level or do you see it migrating back right were in qt now do you see it migrating back as you continue to fund strong loan growth harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well no we dont think its going to go back to precovid levels weve had a lot of initiatives around operating accounts and weve gathered a lot of clients so we dont think well get back down there we did see the mix shift that we noted in previously but so far in october and now granted were only days in were feeling pretty good about where this deposit book is hanging in there on particularly on noninterestbearing steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so theres enough sources when you look at sources of funding that maybe we could hold the mix about where it is harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so we may drift down a couple of notches but i dont think its going to be that dramatic steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 got you okay and then as we think about expenses i appreciate next quarter you will give us but when we think about the ramp in hiring through could you just give us some framework about i mean should we at least be at a similar level of expense growth next year just given the hiring that took place through harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well ill give you some data points and then ill let terry talk about momentum i think we should see at least high teens mid to high teens kind of expense growth next year thats what were kind of looking at currently terry m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah steve i think on higher momentum as you saw third quarter was a record quarter for us i dont look for it to stay at revenue producers a quarter but i expect it to remain high going forward and so i think your idea is correct that the hiring more or less occurs on a straight line and i would expect it to continue for the foreseeable future and so how that bears on the expense growth is just exactly what you said i mean itll be elevated because we have hired throughout the year and frankly we intend to continue hiring at a similar rate in steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay that is helpful and then finally there are many investors on the sidelines who are nervous to own your stock here not because of pinnacles credit quality but their concern on the credit outlook for most of the fintech lenders out there including bhg particularly given bhg expanded these newer verticals can you just share with people on the sidelines how worried are you on the credit outlook at bhg given the macro environment just additional color you could provide would be really helpful thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold you want to go first harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc sure m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc and maybe ill add some color after yeah harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc sure weve had a lot of conversations with the leadership at bankers healthcare group over the last several quarters about their confidence with their book their confidence in their credit models they think or they believe currently that their models are sound if there is a significant kind of uptick in inflationary pressure no doubt their chargeoffs could tweak up but they are very confident with respect to their ability to find the best borrowers in this environment and continue to monitor their book for call it cracks or weaknesses pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i think steve i might add just a couple other things obviously for us as an investor i always have been since we started and continue to try to understand really what all that credit risk is i think some things that give me great comfort are number one theyve got a huge group of people in analytics they work on all kinds of variables youve heard us talk about that in the past but the main variable the foremost variable obviously is their credit score mechanism we provide information to you on the fico scores because thats a common thing that you and i and others can all understand its a way to levelset but they dont underwrite their credit off that fico score theyre using their own proprietary model which they can demonstrate is more predictive than the fico score and so again these are not credit novices theyve been through a number of cycles they went through the great recession without sustaining any losses which not many of the banks they sell credit to could say that and so again i think they started as a credit score card analytical group has broadened out but it still is their strength and so i love the capability that they have the fact that their model is a little more rich than a fico score which is sort of the industry standard i think thats one thing that gives me a lot of confidence as i mentioned i think the second thing i would say is again these guys have been through recessions in the past and their performance was extraordinarily good it was better than our banks performance and better than most banks performance and so thats another item that gives me a great deal of confidence i think the third thing is when so much of it is consumer credit some might even the business credit has a consumer underwriting orientation to it and so i guess the idea for me here is that the average borrower has income of when i think about various other fintechs and i wont go through and name them all and what their credit products are and so forth i dont know any of them that are underwriting borrowers with in annual income its a different class borrower these are not people that are borrowing money for a washing machine or a small home improvement or something i mean these are substantial people and so again i think the mix of their borrower is different than what most of their fintech providers other fintech providers are doing for their borrowers so anyway i just ramble through those three things steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats great color thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yes operator thank you and the next question is coming from stephen scouten from piper sandler stephen your line is live stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 thank you good morning everyone i guess i wanted to dig down into the beta expectations you have that you laid out in the presentation both on the loan and then especially on the deposit side growth and kind of historical growth technical difficulty m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hello harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc steve are you there stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co spread and where youve been today yeah can you guys hear me harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah you just kind of blanked out on me stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay i guess im just trying to think about where loan growth what kind of loan growth expectations you have in relative to those depose beta expectations because it would seem with your expense guidance if its going to be highteens again we might be looking for highteens growth again technical difficulty harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah sorry but i think i got the steve i think i got the gist of the question you kind of blanked out on me im not sure if the others on the call experienced the same thing or not i think going into next year and the just looking at the net interest margin if it historically if it responds the way it has done in the past were anticipating that as the fed stops raising rates that the left side of the balance sheet yields and rates will likely start topping off and that the deposit lag will likely be in effect through that time i was looking at our net interest margin performance over the last two years it stayed fairly consistent at around a to range for the last two years during a fairly flat rate environment so wed anticipate that kind of performance with respect to our at least our margins once the fed settles down on their rate increases is that helpful stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thats helpful and it sounds like i might be having technology issues so i let somebody else hop on thanks a lot pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator thank you the next question is coming from michael rose from raymond james michael your line is live michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning you gave us a lot of colors as usual on bhg very much appreciated on the one hand you continue to grow you feel comfortable with that growth but on the other hand the recourse reserves or the new terminology for it is expected to grow kind of as well i hate that i know its really hard to kind of forecast but you had really good growth through the year in bhg better than excepted can you give us a stab at kind of the puts and takes of how we should think about and the growth of that business just going into a slowdown thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah steve weve had i mean michael weve had some preliminary conversations with bhg about their next years outlook they have they do believe their production platform will continue to deliver at a reasonable pace next year and they think they have opportunities to continue to kind of pivot between the securitization platform and the gain on sale and the bank auction platform i dont think it would be unreasonable to assume that next years growth rate might be somewhere around a number something like that im hesitant to get into too much detail because we need to have some more conversations with bankers healthcare group michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc i certainly understood and thanks for that maybe just more broadly speaking you guys have been obviously very active on the hiring front and youve talked about dislocations maybe getting even more advantageous for you into next year just given the market dislocations but its been a while i think since youve kind of entertained the thoughts of maybe doing a whole bank transaction and just wanted to see given the dislocations that some banks are going to have and some of the credit issues that i think were going to see is that an avenue that you could potentially open up again as we think about the next couple of years thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc michael i think on that front youve heard my answer before and its really no different in our position i dont think its changed im never going to say never that we just absolutely wont do it i dont want to say that but i dont think its fair to say you can see the hiring momentum that we have i expect it to continue as long as we can sort of continue that market share play for the foreseeable future which i think we can youd have to have a really compelling transaction to want to do it and so if we find one of those certainly we would consider it but again i just think the bias is more toward organic growth and continuing our market share play were really in i think a luxurious position to have built a preferred bank standing for large bank employees who want to exit their large bank and so again i expect that will be our principal lever pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc appreciate it maybe just one final quick one just putting together some of the expectations you talked about initially for next year is the expectation that just given the rate outlook and beta assumptions and what you said on bhg and expenses that you could generate positive operating leverage next year or is that going to be more challenging thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold you want to take that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc sure yeah i dont think its unreasonable were i believe at our core sub50 efficiency ratio kind of franchise and i believe that weve got all the opportunities in the world to increase that or better that here in the near term michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc helpful thanks for taking my questions operator thank you and the next question is coming from jared shaw from wells fargo securities jared your line is live jared your line is live please check your mute button you may go ahead with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc right sorry about that thanks for taking the question i guess going back to bhg could you give an update harold on maybe some of the steps that theyre taking to utilize more ceclfriendly disposition avenues and what a day one potential estimate for bhg could look like right now harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah sure theres currently several different options or maybe a couple that ill talk about one is within the guidance you can sell more the cash flows and then avoid cecl so call it similar to what they do with the gain on sale platform with the banks they can do that with institutional investors they can also sell part of the residual cash flows maybe carve out some of those future cash flows and sell those and then take those credits out of the cecl kind of domain so theres a variety of different tactics they can deploy to try to avoid cecl right now theyre thinking their reserves which are currently at could get into the to range with day one cecl impacts so i dont know if that gets you all the way there jared but thats what weve been talking about thus far jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then any update on how youre thinking about your ownership stake in that in the past you said that you would like you said youd travel with the founders and then over the last few quarters it sounded like pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 maybe you could forge your own path how should we be thinking about bhg as a percentage of the pinnacle balance sheet or earnings stream going forward harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc terry ill start and then let you finish i dont think weve got any real strong change with our perspective on our ownership of bhg were definitely not interested in owning or buying a majority stake in the franchise i think both pinnacle and the two founders of the franchise were all on the same page i think if there were a liquidity event an opportunity for one i think the founders and ourselves wed entertain it and see where it goes from there the market right now is not real supportive of any kind of transaction but i believe that like i said were all on the same page if there were something to come down the pipe m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc jared i think i might add to harolds comments i mean what he said is accurate i think the case is that as you know the valuation whatever it is it bounces around and has moved rapidly if you look at what i would say the value of that company is or what it has been months ago months ago months ago months ago its pretty dramatically different over that time period and so all of those things influence what can in fact be done when you talk about a liquidity event obviously what you got to get down to is a willing buyer and a willing seller and so again there are people that are always circling and looking for valuations and so forth i think as harold said we and the other two owners are at this point at a really similar spot wed be willing to write valuations reduce our stakes or sell the company and so again its just about how the market moves and where you find that willing buyer and willing seller i think ive indicated if nobody had to be happy but me i think some reduction in our stake in bhg to the extent people want a minority interest in the company is a good idea i love the income that it generates its provided extraordinary flexibility its been a tremendous strategic advantage in terms of funding extraordinary growth here and allowing us to maintain very high profitability and so i dont want to completely give that away to be candid but if it became a lesser percent of our income that would probably i think add to investor perception pe multiples all those kinds of things so at any rate its impossible to say exactly what is going to happen but wed be willing to consider a reduction or a sale of the company and so if that comes about thatll be fine but were very comfortable to continue in the current situation as well jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay all right thanks and i guess just shifting over to loan growth and the outlook as we go into next year it certainly sounds like you have good momentum with all hiring if were looking at a weaker maybe economic backdrop and i look at slide and the different avenues of where that growth has come from do you think that you could see a shift with a bigger dependence on the expansion markets or having a bigger relative impact from the hiring or do you think that well see sort of a broadbased equally diversified pipeline of growth going into m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 my own sense of it is that it ought to remain relatively similar i think as the new markets take hold their growth will be faster than in the legacy markets but i think generally that allocation of the growth is probably a pretty similar thing when you look at months from now jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot operator thank you and the next question is coming from catherine mealor from kbw catherine your line is live catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc wanted to go back up to the margin and the cumulative betas through i thought was really helpful with the loan beta and then cumulative deposit beta how do you think as we move into next year i know youre not giving next year guidance yet but just kind of generally and directionally between the two how do you think those two trend next year and is that cumulative loan beta is that a good number for next year are there dynamics with kind of pricing of new loans and all of that that may kind of change that as we look at it full cycle harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well first of all i want to make sure that we emphasize more about where the margin is versus where the betas go we provide the beta information that kind of help people get through it but were more interested in what we think the margins going to do given where the rate cycle is and like i was mentioning earlier we think the margin once the fed begins to kind of stop or ease or just stall that the margin will probably flatten out and with deposit competition we probably see some more increases in our deposit rates but as far as a beta question itself in all likelihood the loan beta would probably once it stalls would probably come down as with competitive pressure but we think the lag on deposits would probably be more influential on the longerterm margin catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it and on that how are you thinking i mean the margin indiscernible substantial expansion this quarter i expect well see it again next quarter any kind of any nearterm thoughts on where you think the margin may shake out next quarter and then pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah yeah were not currently planning for another 30basispoint uptick but it ought to be somewhere half maybe a little more than half going into the fourth quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc half of the increase we saw this quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats right catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and so you probably peak early and then start to flatten out to come down as you move through the rest of the year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah our planning assumption is next year that we ought to see two 25basispoint rate decreases in the last half of the year and so the margin pretty much flattens out in the second quarter catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay and then on the composition of deposit growth of just the balanced growth was great to see just big picture how are you strategically thinking about the composition of where that growth will come i know you mentioned you still expect to grow noninterestbearing but then how much do you think comes from noncore versus core and then also you talked about some different specialty deposit strategies that youve got you could kind of talk about how you think that factors into the deposit growth outlook as well harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc terry ill start and let you go from there traditionally our client base will provide to of the core funding that we need to fund our loan growth and so weve always had to go to the wholesale markets tell a broker or federal home loan bank to try to fund the gap with respect to try to fund the gap so here over the last couple of years weve not had that problem weve not had to go to the wholesale markets much at all to get our liquidity to fund loan growth so we do have capacity internally to go to the wholesale markets to fund loan growth but there will be a stop gap before we had kind of a wholesale funding kind of limitation i dont see us getting anywhere near that but we will do it to fund some loan growth but our like i said earlier our belief is that our franchise a lot of value of our franchise is built in our deposit book and so weve got to make sure that were looking under rocks for deposits and i think our relationship managers are doing just that today i think where this new deposit growth is going to come from is from our new hires and our new markets pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 terry m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think i would add to that harold commented i think when he went over the slide we have over the last year or two been building some specialty deposit funding around hsas around community associations which is inclusive of homeowners associations and property managers some nonprofit specialties and so forth and those have been built there all through breakeven they are having success and we believe will be a meaningful part of the funding as we get out through here as well so in addition to new people and new markets i think the new product specialties are important to us in terms of low cost funding catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you so much thats all i got m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you the next question is coming from brian martin from janney montgomery brian your line is live brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question just maybe circling back here i have just one clarification on the comments or just questions on expense growth earlier i know youre not giving the guidance but just when youre talking about kind of that the highteen expense growth was that more from the people youve already hired was that really talking about the salary line or youre talking about total expenses there just for clarity harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah mid to high teens would be for total expenses again were going through all of our planning for currently were pretty much maybe at the first few steps of a mini step journey but thats probably where its going to shake out at the end of the day but that said as terry alluded to earlier in the call our hiring plan when you put it in effect or you start executing it what were going to do is were going to hire the people whenever we get an opportunity were going to be opportunistic hirers and so we may put in the plan that were going to maybe hire revenue producers next year or or whatever the number might be but if we have a chance to double that we might just go after it brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 got you okay no it makes sense how about just shifting gears to the bhg i think your i guess third quarter is obviously down but strong harold i guess fourth quarter as it shapes up right now should is the expectation that it should drift a bit lower at bhg today harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont know if i caught all your brian say that go back through that one more time brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah just the outlook for bhg in i mean relative to third quarter third quarter was strong but down but fourth quarter is also expected to be a bit lower given kind of your comments about the performance harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah yeah i think so what could change our current perspective is if they send more loans to the auction platform which is what they did this quarter so brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc right now they believe theyre going to warehouse more loans on their balance sheet which could tamp down earnings in the fourth quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and then just the maybe just looking at one line item on fee income and that was just the i guess the gain or loss on sale of other equity investments kind of the i guess significant drop this quarter as you guys have talked about kind of that volatility there but just as we think about that number going forward i guess just kind of thinking average of the past quarters or just whats the best way to think about that given this quarters mark relative to last quarters harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were not anticipating much movement in that yeartodate number here today well get more information through the quarter on all of those investments and see where it shakes out but right now were not planning on any kind of up or down movement with respect to anything in the fourth quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay and the new loan yields harold where are they coming on today i guess whether it be the month of september or just kind of whatever most recent data you have where are they where are you putting on new loans today pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i could flip down to the back of the into the supplemental information and look at that number but at the end of september we were at so that would imply that were yeah were getting there brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah if its in the slide here ill grab it but i missed that if i did so no problem on that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thanks for taking the questions guys harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks brian operator thank you and the next question is coming from jennifer demba from truist securities jennifer your line is live jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jennifer harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc terry i wonder if you could just give us your thoughts on your the performance in your expansion markets and especially commercial lending just looking at slide just if you could just talk about where how things have gone in each market versus your expectations thank you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 yeah ill try to just throw our thoughts if im not addressing what youre interested in just redirect me and ill hit it and i would say that the atlanta market is almost exactly on target for what we would have hoped were probably a little ahead on hiring i think volumes are generally right where we would expect them to be and so were excited about whats going on here in atlanta i think in the case of alabama both huntsville and birmingham i would say they have outperformed what our expectations were both in terms of hiring and in terms of the balance sheet volumes that they indiscernible early on both sides of the balance sheet loan and deposit volumes have been really attractive and so i think were going to do better in those markets than what we had said and then in the case of dc i would say just for me personally thats probably the market i am most excited about as you can see by the months in existence were still in the early stages but their pipelines are building pretty dramatically you can see theyve had great success hiring people and the again both sides of the balance sheet for them whats in the pipeline and what we expect to happen over the next two quarters theyll do better than what our original pro forma was as well so anyway thats how i look at those big markets if i not addressed what youre interested in please redirect me jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc no thats great color thank you so much and just a question a lot of analysts and investors have asked about normalizing credit and i just wonder what you think normal is is normal somewhere between where we have been at these historically low losses and problem asset levels and the historical median or is it or is it the historical median i mean what do you think normal is m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i think when you start using the term like normal that obviously has to apply over a period of time to me sort of through the cycle you get ups and downs and so i dont think theres any basis under which i would expect to operate our economy at the levels of classified assets and nonperforming assets and so forth that we are currently at through an entire cycle so at any rate i think those median numbers are theyre a reasonable way to think about what ought to happen through a whole cycle again i personally think were a ways away from that but again i think were not for me to say we expect things to normalize i just want people to understand i dont think were going to be operating at the level of classified assets and nonperforming assets that weve been at over the last handful of quarters for the foreseeable future surely youll have to go up to some extent again maybe the median numbers are good planning assumption jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks terry operator thank you and we had catherine mealor from kbw come in with a followup catherine your line is live pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks i just had a followup on expenses feel like your stack has started to underperform since the call started when you mentioned a high teens expense growth rate so i just wanted to circle back to that comment and maybe provide you the opportunity to remind us how nimble you can be on the expense side if the revenue growth is not going to come in as expected if we see loan growth slow or the margin come in lower than expected how nimble can you be on pulling back that highteen expense guidance you gave thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc harold you want to go first harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill go first thanks catherine for the followup yeah i mean weve always got the ability to take money out of the expense book but the big thing that we can that we always do around here is our incentive plans are all tied to earnings growth and so if our earnings growth doesnt come around then weve got opportunities to take quite a large sum of money out of our incentive plan to kind of fortify our pl and make sure our earnings growth is reasonable under the circumstances the other thing and we did this back during the financial crisis is we can always pull back on hiring that will impact our longer term growth so were not really anxious to do that but theres a lot of variability in our expense book that we can go after when its absolutely necessary terry ill stop there m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah catherine i guess i had to hit two things i mean harold said it but just in case there are people who dont get it the incentive we have sacrificed of our incentives if we dont produce our earnings targets and our earnings targets were set to be top quartile performance and so thats the biggest expense lever that you have we dont get paid unless shareholders do get paid and i dont think there is a company that im familiar with that will do that and protect shareholders to that extent i think the second thing is and ill pound away on this for a reason but i dont feel successful in getting people to understand that the hiring that we do because we do it on a straight line its a huge part of the expense basin so were paying expenses today for revenues that are yet to come and so my only message in that is theres an immense amount of profitability that comes when we quit hiring people all the revenue continues to roll in and the expenses cease to grow and so theres huge profit leverage in just that single idea right there when you think about having hired revenue producers this quarter that revenue will come in and so then if we have difficulties we quit hiring people and so the expenses stop growing but the revenue continues to grow so anyway thats my own view of it thats the way weve operated over an extended period of time and im not sure everybody understands how that works but you can quit hiring and it does produce earnings growth even though it impacts the longer term balance sheet and earnings growth in the short run it accelerates earnings growth pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2022 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful thanks for the followup and i mean i just if youre going to put a high teens expense growth right out there then its just fair to assume that the revenue growth rate is going to be above that just given your business model correct m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc no doubt no doubt catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc awesome thank you thats all i got m
