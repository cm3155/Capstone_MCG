financial corp thanks jeff and good evening everyone before we get into first quarter results ill begin tonight with an overview of covid19 and its impact in roughly the last two weeks of the first quarter the world changed abruptly as the spread of covid19 accelerated like all of you were watching with empathy and gratitude as people and communities take extraordinary action care for the sick support first responders and slow the transmission of the virus capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 at capital one were focused on the wellbeing of our associates our customers and the communities we serve and weve fully mobilized to do our part to make an immediate positive impact enabled by our technology transformation about of our associates and of our nonbranch associates smoothly transitioned to remote working arrangements and are now securely and productively working from home for our associates who must be at capital one location weve taken steps to improve social distancing adopted flexible attendance and leave policies and increased hourly pay for our customers were offering a range of forbearance options and taking steps to make it easier for banking customers to access their money while social distancing covid19 has catalyzed three unprecedented events that are sweeping the world with breathtaking speed a global pandemic a partial shutdown of the global economy and the fiscal intervention of a magnitude not seen since the great depression it is difficult to predict the magnitude and duration of the disruption capital one is wellpositioned to weather these challenges throughout our history weve focused on resilience in all of our choices on liquidity and capital as a result our balance sheet is strong we have deep liquidity reserves and a strong capital position weve also been obsessed with resilience in our choices of businesses and segments and in all of our underwriting decisions in good times and bad weve avoided or exited less resilient businesses and segments we built stress testing into our underwriting decisions years before the advent of industrywide annual stress tests we model measure and analyze the resilience of our loan portfolios from origination throughout the life of the loans and as always were focused on resilience and longterm value creation in the choices were making today to manage through the pandemic and its impacts our businesses have demonstrated a track record of successfully weathering recessions including the great recession and emerging in a position of strength on the other side we are working hard to help our customers whove been impacted by covid19 that help takes different forms depending on the business in card and auto forbearance is primarily in the form of shortterm payment deferrals and fee waivers in the retail bank we are waiving selected fees for impacted customers and in commercial we are working with our clients on a more customized basis as of april domestic card forbearance enrollments covered about of active accounts or of loan balances and in our auto business about of our customers or about of balances our investments to transform our technology and how we work are powering our response to the pandemic ive already mentioned our quick and essentially issuefree transition to working from home which was enabled by our move to the cloud and our broad integration of mobile technology digital and data capabilities are also powering rapid changes and enhancements in underwriting and modeling and expanding the scope and effectiveness of realtime monitoring turning now to guidance because of the economic disruption and uncertainty caused by covid19 we are withdrawing our efficiency ratio guidance including our guidance of annual operating efficiency ratio of in capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 were only a handful of weeks into the pandemic and its economic effects and there is a wide range of possible outcomes it is difficult to forecast specific efficiency targets or time frames while the pandemic runs its course but we remain focused on delivering positive operating leverage over time its one of the most important payoffs of our digital transformation and a key element of delivering longterm shareholder value we are also withdrawing our guidance on marketing we continue to make marketing decisions at the line of scrimmage based on our dynamic assessment of market risks and opportunities consistent with our long standing focus on resilience were pulling back on marketing in the nearterm based on our current view of covid19 risks pulling up were entering a time of significant challenges spawned by the global coronavirus pandemic and the near shutdown of economic activity across our country and the world the largest government stimulus in decades and increased forbearance should help to mitigate some of these challenges but its difficult to predict how it will all play out on top of that its even more difficult to predict the course of the pandemic and the length and time that economic activity will remain shut down as we manage through what lies ahead i believe we will continue to be wellserved by our strong balance sheet our resilient businesses our digital transformation and most importantly our deep experience and learnings from managing through good times and bad times for decades we are ready to take on these challenges now ill turn the call over to scott richard scott blackley chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks rich capital one lost billion or per share in the first quarter net of adjusting items our eps loss in the quarter was driven by a billion allowance build turning to slide ill cover the allowance in more detail the adoption of cecl increased our allowance by billion as of january in line with previously communicated expectations our first quarter allowance build of billion consists of billion in card approximately million in auto and approximately million in commercial we modeled several economic scenarios and then we added some judgmental overlays in determining our allowance the most heavily weighted of these economic scenarios included a sharp increase to a peak unemployment during q2 of followed by an improvement into i would encourage you not to get too focused on the headline unemployment rate because it was just one of the many variables impacting our allowance for example after we completed our modeling we added qualitative overlays reflecting risks and uncertainties due to the more severe economic forecasts we saw around and after quarter end on slide you can see that our coverage ratio in domestic card has more than doubled since december to almost our us branded card coverage ratio was the difference between these ratios is driven by losssharing agreements in our partnerships portfolio where we only allow for our portion of the estimated losses our auto coverage now stands at over times the coverage at year end and commercial reserve coverage has also doubled to almost driven primarily by oil and gas weve included an oil and gas slide in our appendix with details on that specific business capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 next id like to discuss our capital and liquidity positions as rich mentioned we focus on the resilience of our liquidity and capital positions in good times and in bad and accordingly we enter into the covid19 situation with strong levels of capital and liquidity on slide you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was up from at year end and well above the regulatory requirement at the end of the quarter we had total liquidity reserves from cash securities and federal home loan bank capacity of billion including about billion in cash turning to slide i will cover capital our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the first quarter well above the regulatory minimum requirement of and about billion above our longterm capital target in the first quarter we purchased approximately million or million common shares prior to suspending our share repurchase program on march in terms of the impact of new regulations in q1 we adopted the federal reserves final tailoring rule and elected to opt out of including aoci in regulatory capital measures we also elected to adopt the 5year cecl transition to regulatory capital these impacts of the elections are included on slide lastly turning to slide you can see net interest margin was in the quarter basis points lower than the prioryear quarter on a quarteroverquarter basis net interest margin decreased basis points largely driven by lower day count the higher average cash balance that i mentioned previously and lower yields on our loan portfolio this was partially offset by lower interest expense paid on deposits looking forward our net interest margin will continue to be impacted by a variety of factors including our asset mix deposit pricing cash positions and day count and as weve previously mentioned we generally view a continued low rate environment as a headwind and a higherpositively slow yield curve as a tailwind all else equal a significant decrease in rates and our elevated levels of cash are likely to create a headwind to net interest margin in the near term and with that i would turn the call back over to rich rich richard d fairbank chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thanks scott this quarter there is an obvious recurring theme in each of our businesses and for the company first quarter results reflect two distinct time periods january through midmarch before covid19 impacts took hold and the last two weeks of the quarter when covid19 drove sharp changes in many metrics and trends precovid19 results generally show solid momentum and strong performance on growth credit and efficiency that have put capital one in a strong position postcovid19 trend show a clear inflection but theres too much uncertainty to simply extrapolate recent trend with that context ill pick up on slide which summarizes first quarter results for our credit card business preprovision results were solid in the first quarter with continued yearoveryear growth in loans and purchase volumes credit card segment results and trends are largely driven by the performance of our domestic card business which is shown on slide capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 domestic card ending loan balances increased yearoveryear driven by the addition of the acquired walmart portfolio the emergence of covid19 impacts late in the quarter caused a deceleration in the growth of ending loan balance first quarter average loans grew yearoveryear first quarter purchase volume was up from the first quarter of with strong growth through most of the quarter partially offset by sharp decline near the end of the quarter by the end of the first quarter weekly purchase volume was running at a yearoveryear decline of about consistent with industry trends our largest declines were in travel and entertainment restaurant and discretionary retail these category decreases were partially offset by an increase in spending at supermarkets and discount stores through april weekly purchase volume continues to be down about yearoveryear revenue increased yearoveryear growth in average loans was offset by lower revenue margin the revenue margin declined basis points compared to the first quarter of a majority of the decline was driven by the expected impact of the revenuesharing agreement on the acquired walmart portfolio the expected math of comparing to the first quarter of which benefited from a rewards liability release and lower net interchange revenue resulting from the late quarter drop in purchase volumes noninterest expense was up from the prioryear quarter in line with the trend in revenue the chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear driven by the addition of the acquired walmart portfolio because the delinquency rate is not affected by the losssharing agreement the addition of the walmart portfolio put upward pressure on the first quarter 30plus delinquency rate despite this upward pressure the delinquency rate improved by basis points yearoveryear to there were no significant covid19 impact on domestic card delinquency and chargeoff metrics in the first quarter however we had a significant allowance build in the quarter reflecting the expected credit impact of the shutdown of economic activity pulling up in the first quarter our domestic card business delivered solid results and quickly mobilized to respond to covid19 impacts slide summarizes first quarter results for our consumer banking business the auto business posted yearoveryear growth in ending loans and growth in average loans but by the end of the quarter leading indicators of growth started to show covid19 impact weekly dealer applications were down an average of about yearoveryear in the second half of march and down about yearoveryear in the first half of april weekly dealer originations were down an average of about yearoveryear in the second half of march and down about yearoveryear in the first half of april ending deposits in the consumer bank were up yearoveryear average deposit interest rate for the quarter declined basis points compared to the prioryear quarter and basis points from the sequential quarter driven by the market interest rate environment our average deposit rate paid going forward will depend upon several factors including the market interest rate environment our deposit mix our funding needs and competitive dynamics consumer banking revenue decreased from from the first quarter of last year underlying revenue growth from higher auto loans and retail deposits was more than offset by two factors differences in the timing of federal capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 reserve rate cuts versus our deposit pricing moves pressured revenue in the quarter and our deposit mix continued to shift toward higher rate products noninterest expense was essentially flat yearoveryear first quarter provision for credit losses increased million yearoveryear primarily as the result of an allowance build in the auto business driven by covid19 and cecl the auto chargeoff rate increased basis points compared to the prioryear quarter to moving to slide ill discuss our commercial banking business ending loan balances were up yearover year about half of this growth resulted from customers drawing down lines late in the quarter after peaking in march line draws have subsided thus far in april first quarter average loans were up compared to the first quarter a year ago average deposits also increased about first quarter revenue was up from the prioryear quarter driven by growth in average loan balances and strong noninterest income noninterest expense was essentially flat compared to the prioryear quarter provision for credit losses increased million compared to the first quarter of driven by a significant allowance build a little more than half of the allowance build is related to pressure in the oil and gas portfolio caused by the sharp drop in commodity prices in the wake of the shutdown in economic activity the remainder of the build is related to covid19 impact across the portfolio weve provided a breakout of oil and gas portfolio composition and reserves on slide the commercial banking chargeoff rate for the quarter was the criticized performing loan rate for the first quarter was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was pulling way up in the first quarter capital one rapidly mobilized to respond to covid19 and the disruption it is causing with a focus on our associates our customers and our communities we are in a position of strength to weather the pandemic and were closely monitoring conditions and managing our businesses for resilience and longterm value creation i am struck by how fast how unpredictably and how much the world can change in just two weeks rapid change can leave companies scrambling to make choices in the heat of the moment in a swirl of uncertainty and anxiety but so much of the leverage is in the choices one makes before coming face to face with sudden challenges ive often said that its the choices you make during the good times that have the most impact on how you weather the bad times and thats a core tenet of how we manage capital one every day from our founding days we have hardwired resilience into every choice we make on credit capital and liquidity our balance sheet is strong weve built resilient businesses and a resilient loan portfolio weve invested to transform our technology and how we work and were taking decisive actions to aggressively manage credit risk and further strengthen resilience leveraging what weve learned over decades there are certainly challenges ahead for the economy for our customers and for capital one at this point its very hard to predict how great the challenges may be or how long they may last but were wellpositioned to navigate and manage through these uncertain times and to emerge with the strength to find attractive opportunities on the other side now well be happy to answer your questions jeff capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 jeff norris senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp thank you rich well now start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup and if you have followup questions after the qa session the investor relations team will be available to answer them matt please start the qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc good evening thanks for taking the call and hope everybody is safe there rich i guess i just wanted to understand how youre thinking about the card business as we go through the next couple of years in particular how to integrate the new walmart portfolio and relationship into the business that youve got and what it means for growth in that portfolio with that customer set richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so betsy good evening the walmart integration has really happened and so we have a wonderful working partnership with walmart really exceptional and ive been struck by how much they appreciate the importance of the card in their business and in their future digital business opportunities and so weve been optimistic for what this partnership can be at the moment financially the partnership is dominated by the economics of the back book portfolio that we acquired and thats fully integrated and thats performing as expected and we have been working very hard with walmart to put in place the elements and the channels and the opportunities for originations covid19 coming along is a bit of a challenge in the middle of this and so probably that business will like all of our businesses probably be subject to some of the demand impacts and changes that i mentioned relative to what typically happens in a downturn but were still very focused on moving forward with them and what i am struck by also is we take the very same perspectives on how to manage credit in this environment how to where to find the opportunities and so well be continuing to move forward betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks and then as a followup just wanted to turn to the outlook for the reserve you went through very detailed segmentbysegment which is very much appreciated wanted to understand how you think about that reserve as the next couple of quarters unfold i realize the peak unemployment is but that you put the qualitative overlays on so how much more employment do you feel like youve baked into the current reserve level just so we can get a sense as to when we see the numbers come out how we should be flexing future reserve builds if any capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy thanks for the question i think that the i would start off by saying the reserve when we topped up the reserve at the end of the quarter we actually didnt go and do a another model run we just did an overlay so i cant get too precise in saying like hey heres a specific number that i would tie to our reserve in terms of unemployment level and just in general in terms of how to think about the reserve going forward i would just say that that may not be quite as simple as just taking the headline unemployment and tying that to the size of the allowance i just was talking about the fact that we did do this late add to the reserve based on some of the worsening economic forecasts we had and then the second thing i would just say is that we got i think were just going to see a lot more data in the next days before we have to close the books again and thinking about kind of the path of the countrys response to the virus how the consumer is going to react to all the stimulus and well actually also have some credit data by the time we close the books next quarter which of course were going to use all those things to refine our allowance estimate so at this point id really like to see that data before i speculate on where the allowance might be added jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator next question will come from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you so scott thanks for the color on the reserve build and if i look at your allowance my personal view is that you guys took a more conservative approach so we appreciate that i think some of the card issuers may have a bigger reserve build next quarter but rich i was wondering if you could talk a little bit around loan growth and what your plans are in cards i know if i go back to the credit crisis your loan growth declined significantly and can you just provide some thoughts on stimulus in terms of what the offset might be and how we could think about that richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah thanks don so the first thing that i think is striking well from my experience across several downturns and then thinking about how to interpret this downturn of course we havent seen anything as precipitous as this particular one but a couple of things tend to naturally happen in card the lower purchase volume obviously very striking particularly in this downturn at this point but lower demand for credit lower requests for credit line increases and i want to pause on that because i think there is a kind of intuitive logic people would think well wait a minute when customers feel the strain of the downturn surely a lot of them have to be beating a path to try to get more credit capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 and what ive seen in the past and what were already seeing here is that consumer behavior tends to be in general one of battening down the hatches a bit being more conservative increasing their savings if they have an opportunity to do that sometimes paying down debt now obviously there is a huge gradient across customers but i just wanted to say that our expectation and what were seeing in a matter of weeks is something that is less on the demand side and i would guess that during the period when consumers feel a lot of uncertainty i think that at least for that period of time that demand will be less its also really quite plausible that as things settle out on the other side consumers will still carry that cautiousness with them we saw some of that after the great recession that there were some behavioral changes in that particular case then i want to overlay on top of that what were doing at capital one were making here very very early and into the sort of free fall period of the economy were making choices that are right out of our playbook in downturns and certainly i think make a lot of sense in this downturn tightening our extension of new credit to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection and then were also pulling back on nearterm marketing in response to the decreased opportunity at this very moment for quality growth and of course the decreased marketing has a bit of a that will itself flow into little bit on the growth side so the combination of these natural trends and our actions put downward pressure on loan balances now i really want to stress that this is a moment in time and this is how the markets reacting the consumer is reacting and the choices were making at this moment in time we have really structured our business and our playbooks to be always testing and looking for inflection point and to see where the opportunities can come and we will pounce on them when they do one other thing i want to say is its not like theres going to be a single inflection point and then suddenly sort of the sun is going to come out the way opportunities will emerge will be probably really quite sloped by product area we found across business line the sort of inflection point varied by many many months in our business and then it will vary by segment probably by geography so right now its a time to be cautious but were very very closely monitoring where and when opportunities will present themselves jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp do you have a followup don next question please operator our next question will come from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks hope you guys are doing well rich you talked about pulling back on marketing and obviously that wasnt as evident in the first quarter but when we think about magnitude that you could pull back on on marketing and even other expenses could you just walk us through how youre thinking about it over the course of the period that were going to experience this weakness as a result of covid19 richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 yeah let me start with the marketing first so right now were pulling back in a number of areas to avoid the heightened risk of adverse selection so these areas include some pullbacks in digital and online origination channels direct mail on the advertising side certain productoriented national advertising were continuing to originate through some channels but were also continuing to invest in our brand although the overall brand investment is down and we are at full levels of marketing on our national banking side in fact most of the things that are going on the incredible importance of digital banking experiences just about all of the trends are sort of consistent with an acceleration and the kind of things weve been looking for in consumer behavior relative to our national banks so were full green light on that one and again im talking moments in time and these things are line of scrimmage calls like i have always said so these are not predictions of a sustained set of choices were making im just sharing with you the choices that we are making in this particular phase of this downturn so relative to expenses overall i mean we have wonderful momentum in our company and in our businesses and in our tech transformation so the very immediate choices are more around our choices of credit risk the margin the marketing that were doing we are tightening up on hiring and tightly managing operating expenses as we continue to monitor the trajectory and character of this downturn sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i appreciate slide which goes through some of the commercial oil and gas portfolio exposures but i dont know scott if you could just help us think through the sensitivities around this because were hearing all sorts of stuff happening with the price of oil maybe you can just help us think about how that sort of translates into this and also there were lots of news articles about hedging and derivative contracts and how it affects you maybe you can just clear the air on that as well thank you richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure thanks sanjay so just starting off on ep or excuse me the energy business so that business you see in the slides is really predominantly a exploration and production business and when we did the allowance we based a lot of the allowance on where the revenue stream that those producers are going to have which is basically the forward oil prices and even with the shortterm disruption that was all about spot prices and not so much about the longerterm prices so i wouldnt get too worried about kind of that shortterm disruption in the market overall when i look at that industry and where we are and what is going on with just the incredible reduction in the use of oil and gas i would just say this when we set this reserve up the significant portion of it we added some nonspecific reserves these arent reserves associated with specific names that are struggling we did a pretty healthy amount of qualitative reserves just based on the risk of a number of these names just continuing to struggle so i feel pretty good about the level that we put in there in spite of everything that weve seen in the last several weeks and then moving on to your other questions about kind of what is going on with the commodities so capital one has a business which does some commodities trading on behalf of our customers and our net exposure to commodity price risk is de minimis we did ask the cftc for a temporary relief from being designated as a major swap participant which is the lowest level in that regulatory hierarchy and we did that mainly because the price volatility could move some of our positions into levels that would trigger that registration capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 and we really do appreciate the speed that the cftc granted relief for us and against not having to necessarily register however because the request was really broadly misunderstood in the marketplace we did notify the cftc that were not going to rely on that waiver and were going to go ahead and register if derivative volumes reach the threshold that would require us to register i just have a couple other comments there so one our commercial bank does not engage in the speculative derivative trading since weve provided as i said commodity price hedges as a service to our oil and gas customers and then when we do these trades we basically have backtoback trades we enter into a trade with our customer and we enter into an offsetting trade with wall street and so were really sitting here in a very low risk position and i would just say at the moment there is no outstanding margin calls weve reduced our risk exposure to commodities essentially to zero and you can look in our 10ks and qs and see that this is normal hedging activities and if theres any updates there on that well point that out there but hopefully that clears the air there jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from eric wasserstrom with ubs eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for taking my question can you hear me okay there jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp yeah eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc yeah okay great thanks so im afraid also have a credit question as we think about the reserve adequacy in the card segment i know that you indicated that its i think only reserving for the proportion of the covid19 programs in which you actually bear the risk but is the loss content in those programs significantly different than it is in your overall portfolio such that it would significantly skew that ratio in some way richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp i think that eric the thing i would just say there so one the losssharing in those arrangements we only recognize in our allowance and in our chargeoffs our portion of the loss and some of these losssharing arrangements weve talked about that the walmart losssharing arrangement includes significant losssharing and so as a consequence it really does decrease the amount of coverage that is necessary and required to cover our portion of those losses so while the book itself may have losses that are appropriately reflective of the capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 types of customers that are in there we end up having a much smaller portion of losses that we recognize and our coverage levels are appropriately lower given that relationship eric wasserstrom q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you for that and just as a followup maybe to reframe some of the questions that have been posed i mean i think one of the things that the investment community is struggling with is that subsequent to the close of the quarter i think broader economic conditions and expectations have continued to deteriorate and so in that context again like how should we think directionally about the adequacy of reserves across the different products is there a greater likelihood of needing to do another trueup under the ph cecl provision the forwardlooking economic expectations did you feel like you had a good enough look into april trends such that the first quarters provision really compensated a lot of that already richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well ive mentioned this we did make some adjustments to our modeled reserve as we closed the books in the first week of april i really want to just emphasize that we have certainly seen some scenarios particularly economic scenarios that are more severe than what we modeled but on the other hand weve seen more stimulus thats been brought to bear since then as well and ive said this earlier but i really think that it is very hard for us to predict where the allowance might be headed theres such an important relationship of government stimulus and hardship programs that really are going to work to help offset some of the economic challenges that were seeing right now and i dont have a good sense about if the allowance is going to be bigger or smaller i really just want to see a little bit more data before we have a lean in either direction jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc can everyone hear me jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp yes richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes we can ryan capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone so maybe one question and a followup for me so rich if you look the stocks trading at a discount to tangible capital since this pandemic began on concerns that this could obviously end up eating into the capital base of the company when i look your cet1 is amongst the highest in the industry even after building significant reserves so when you just think about i know its hard to predict at this time you think about the different range of outcomes combined with the fact that youre halting buybacks the balance sheet sounds like its going to be shrinking how do you think about capital and capital progression in this kind of environment richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well ryan i think we enter this downturn i think about the choices that we have made over the years and coming from the sort of risk management philosophy that deepen in the way this company is founded and even a number of choices that were made over the last few years and i think we enter this downturn in a really good position and ryan would it be useful possibly to ph within the aperture of your question and sort of compare do a little bit of a calibration about going through the great recession and calibrate to how i feel about this time around not that we can predict this downturn but in other words though just thoughts about that experience and comparing some of the resilience dynamics would that be helpful in ph to help answer your questions ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc well my followup question was actually going to be and i think everybody is kind of alluding to this on this call the fact that as we see unemployment reach certain levels theres an underlying assumption that losses are going to rise to similar amounts so i actually think it would be helpful for you to compare and contrast this to the financial crisis whats different and what are the factors whether its the card act or anything else thats changed across the industry that you think will make those relationships no longer hold richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yes so knowing of course that this particular downturn is so early nobody knows how prolonged this will be how severe it will be what the recovery will look like or how much government support and forbearance there will be and how it mitigates the economic effects so with those caveats let me talk a little bit about the marketplace as we entered the downturn some of the things on both sides of the ledger at in terms of our resilience levers and opportunities and then so let me start with the marketplace let me start with the consumer i think the us consumer is in much better shape than at the outset of the great recession consumer debt levels are lower on a per capita basis payment obligations are lower still supported by low interest rates the savings rate over the past few years is double what it was before the great recession and were not dealing with a structural problem in the economy like the housing sector pregreat recession that had to work itself out over multiple years before we could see a sustained recovery capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 in corporate market as weve mentioned in earnings calls over the last few years there are some mounting kind of competitive challenges including higher debt levels lower interest coverage weaker covenants all of which feel weaker than before the great recession on the other hand the banks have been a smaller part of this trend and increasing leverage with capital markets and nonbanks taking an increasing share of this growth at capital one we weathered the great recession very well and demonstrated the resilience of our business model today we have a stronger capital position and a stronger liquidity position than we had going into the last crisis and let me comment briefly about each of our major lending businesses there are some offsetting factors that impact the resilience of our card business relative to the last downturn the card act has leveled the playing field but it has negatively impacted resilience by banning the repricing of existing balances and changes to accounting rules now dramatically amplify the volatility of allowance although this doesnt change the underlying resilience of our lending portfolios and of course there were talking about both fas and cecl and our returns while still very strong are somewhat lower than they were prior to the great recession but we have changed the mix of our portfolio reducing our exposure to high balance revolvers and significantly growing our spender business at the top of the market and building a stronger customer franchise across the portfolio and we built losssharing into most of our partnership deals which improves our resilience in the auto business we have lower chargeoffs higher returns a strong franchise build one deep dealer relationship at a time and a more resilient strategy our commercial business did exceptionally well in the great recession but was aided by a business mix and a geography that did not get severely impacted during the downturn our commercial portfolio was still in a developing stage in it looks pretty different today weve exited or reduced exposure to several less resilient segments like small ticket commercial mortgages and equipment finance weve invested in building specialty businesses to generate better riskadjusted returns and weve increased noncredit revenues significantly but we think the overall commercial sector is in worse shape as companies have taken on more debt and increased leverage and the creditor protections have gotten weaker and borrowers have used more aggressive addbacks to inflate earnings now again thats not mostly a description of whats happened to bank lending but really to lending in the broader marketplace which of course impacts banks as well of course no two downturns are the same and we get to look at the great recession in hindsight and thats of course at this point we know very little about how the covid19 pandemic and its economic impacts will play out we know of course that the onset was more abrupt and that the initial worsening is likely to be steeper faster and deeper we also know that the downturn is being met with a more rapid and much bigger fiscal particularly fiscal and monetary intervention the largest fiscal intervention weve seen since the great depression we know that forbearance is available to customers on a much greater scale than it was last time around capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 so our strategy in the face of the current challenges and uncertainties is to aggressively manage credit and resilience from a decisionmaking point of view because downside risks can be nonlinear we take a very cautious approach at this very moment while the economy is descending also though while very proactively positioning for opportunities that may emerge on the other side of this and thats why we said were tightening our extension of the new credit with a real eye toward the probably high adverse selection that is prevailing out there and pulling back on nearterm marketing tightly managing expenses and being really ready to be responsive as this downturn evolves and knowing that we need to evaluate that on a segmentbysegment basis across our business so pulling way up ryan we feel really good about the choices that we made over the years we feel very good across liquidity capital and credit resilience choices as we enter the downturn with the tech transformation weve been able to have a company that can move very quickly and i feel very good about where we are its hard to predict exactly what will happen here but i think the choice is i wouldnt change just about any i really wouldnt change any of the choices knowing where we are now i would not change the choices we made leading up to this and i really like our chances jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks maybe rich or scott could you give us just a little bit of a little more detail about the specific forbearance programs that you have in card and auto in particular how long they might last and what the take up has been in terms of has it peaked can you talk a little bit about that in a little more detail richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah moshe so for card customers who enroll we are allowing them to just give one payment with no late fee on a monthtomonth basis interest continues to accrue and as of april as we said of active accounts have received assistance representing of balances for auto customers can skip one to two payments with initial interest continuing to accrue and payments added to the end of the loan and i want to comment there when i say things are monthly or every two months this is not like thats their only chance but we wanted to give ourselves more flexibility to evaluate the situation knowing how fast things are changing but its certainly likely that customers who are on a monthly program will be extended if the opportunity calls for that and as we said before as of april of customers have received assistance representing of balances its striking as we look between auto and card how much higher the requests are on the auto side and i think that while its striking i dont think its necessarily surprising we have found in fact across our businesses if a you can see visually that the size of the payment amount is a key driver of the number of requests that we get and of course auto payments are typically much higher than credit card minimum payments and the other capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 reason of course is that in auto the stakes are higher for the customer theyre very motivated to make sure that they can keep their car moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got you and as a followup maybe could you just talk a little bit about you talked about the things youre doing to tighten in the card business any changes that you would either think about making or see within the industry with respect to competitiveness of rewards and the kind of products you might see over the next several quarters as we kind of hope one hopes come out of this process richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well i think the rewards marketplace was very competitive in terms of offers and early spend bonus and things like that but it kind of settled out into an equilibrium with purchase volumes down and probably for most card issuers some tightening up in this very moment i dont think we would i think that i would expect the competitiveness to be in terms of products and product offers to be probably stable the intensity of the competition is probably going to lighten up just probably because people are going to cut back on marketing and certain of the products when you think about it for the reward industry and for capital one are oriented towards the things that people arent able to do right now travel entertainment dining and a lot of things like that so i think that this will be a period where i think issuers will be focused on meeting the needs of their customers and be planning for opportunities when things change and opportunities can emerge much sooner than the entire economy recovering again as i said this is a segmentbysegment and situationbysituation kind of thing so were already working to figure out where individual opportunities can be there possibly even that that have become bigger opportunities because of the situation the world is in jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from bill carcache with nomura bill carcache q analyst nomura good evening weve seen other banks this quarter generally set their reserves at levels sufficient to cover about on average of the cumulative losses contemplated in their severely adverse scenarios under dfast can you share any thoughts on why you guys might differ on this metric richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah bill thanks for the question so obviously there are different scenarios thats the starting point and i wont go into all of the differences there but just kind of a few points as you think about if youre calibrating us capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 against others the first is that when you think about our allowance versus the way the fed models dfast one of the issues that impacts that comparison is that the fed uses industry average recovery rates and as i mentioned last quarter our practice is to work recoveries which results in a longer tail and thats really important under cecl because in cecl you take the undiscounted recoveries as an allowance offset so our cecl recoveries i believe are going to be quite a bit higher versus the fed and their industry average recovery rates the second point i would make is that when these partnerships that we talked about that have losssharing arrangements that meaningfully reduces the losses that are attributable to capital one and we only have to allow for our portion of those losses in our allowance and in our provision and so that is how we do our resilience in modeling processes while we dont have visibility into the fed modeling approaches i dont think that the fed necessarily gives us credit in dfast for that offset because theyve historically not collected all the data necessary to make those adjustments so just a couple of factors that you should consider in terms of how we sit relative to others jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc afternoon thank you for taking my questions first one is im trying to think through how stimulus might be different this time i mean if you think about it there was some information put out in the wall street journal today is that for a lower income worker stimulus to the extent they have unemployment either is a pay increase for a period of time for them whereas for a prime consumer undergoing unemployment and receiving benefits of the cares act its still a substantial decrease in compensation for a while how do you guys think through that in terms of relative performance in your nonprime book versus your prime book this go around richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp john i think whats striking about the fiscal stimulus here well there are many things probably striking to all of us about it but when weve gone back and specifically calibrated to the great recession i dont have the numbers right in front of me but i was struck by the fact that the benefits for those who get like unemployment benefits the unemployment benefits are higher its across a range of relevant incomes the entire line is higher and the eligibility is significantly higher so those two things are its hard to quantify how much of an impact that will be because no one can quantify how much of an impact it was the last time but intuitively i think that effect can have quite a bit of impact in a good way on peoples ability to weather their individual storms and make it to the other side with respect to subprime versus prime the first thing i always say is i think if i showed you the by income if i prime or you take prime and subprime youve got at the top of the market there tends to be some very high income folks but i think you would be surprised that theres not as much slope as one might think relative to capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 things like income on across our business as you move along the credit spectrum there is some slope but not all that much all of that said though the fact that i think the government is working hard to create a safety net for people who dont necessarily have all of the buffers some people might have in life and the fact that that net is extending wider and broader and deeper i think that that should have a pretty positive benefit for consumers and their ability to among other things pay their bills and their credit card bills and i do want to say that while its only a small number of days of data we could see in our payment rate a spike up around the time those individual checks were coming in so that could be a shortterm thing but that would be confirmatory of the intuition that we would have john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thats very helpful color and then a separate question is tied to the stayathome situation were all in have you seen any different types of behavioral action given that you have a pretty large digital banking and jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp hey john im sorry john im sorry to interrupt you youre breaking up we cant understand the question can you john hecht q analyst jefferies llc you guys hear me now jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp its better john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay the question was as weve been in stayathome type of environment for a while have you seen any behavioral change with respect to interaction with your consumer on digital banking given that you invested pretty heavily in that opportunity jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp well john im so sorry lets try one more time and then we might have to move on but richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well john were you saying given that weve invested heavily on our consumer bank in terms of the digital side of the business are we seeing anything particular there would that be close to the question that you have capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah particularly given that were stayathome situation and youre going to have a greater opportunity to interact with the digital over the digital channel richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well an interesting thing is we are probably in the best position in america to have a calibration about because we not only have a digital bank we also have a branchbased bank in some of our geographies as well and so we certainly can see the calibration look the first thing i would say is there certainly are a core of customers who still need and want to well they very much want to use the bank and weve been able to keep most of our branches open by like of them by having drivethroughs and some glass windows for some social separation so weve certainly seen a continued volume there but if i pull up i think that this moment is some people say they predict gosh people will have very different behaviors on the other side of this moment ill make a different prediction i think this is going to be an accelerant to the behaviors that we were all as a society heading for anyway and the advantage i think that the banks who have really driven their customers to digital and built the capabilities that can help a customer pretty much do everything digitally it was always where the worlds going but i think its just an acceleration of the bell curve shifted in terms of i think the number of folks this is me talking more intuitively than empirically but this is why i said earlier when i talked about were going to keep our foot on the gas with respect to the marketing and the investment in our national banking strategy because of course what that is as ive often called it were trying to build the bank of the future and i think that years in the evolution of america and consumer behavior possibly just got compressed here jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator our next question will come from rick shane with jp morgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan hey guys thanks for taking my questions two questions first in the past you talked about a basis point benefit from the loss sharing in the walmart agreement throughout im wondering if theres any cap on that or how much we could expect that to flex as chargeoffs rise related to covid19 richard scott blackley a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey rick how are you look as you think about walmart we did talk about a basis point impact to delinquencies and on an ongoing basis about that same level going forward and i think that theres yes we capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 could absolutely see variability in the impact of that to the total just given movements in the loss rates of either part of that calculation i would anticipate them to be relatively small because the loss sharing is so significant with walmart but its it could move up a bit and still not really impact our overall loss rate all that much but theres not a cap in the contract if by chance you were asking that so this loss share is on a percentage basis and it will stay that way richard shane q analyst jpmorgan okay great and then rich for you look youre a serious student of human behavior and im curious what you have seen in terms of consumer behavior so far that has surprised you the most richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp im not sure anything has been surprising im certainly struck by heres the thing thats interesting about this particular downturn almost all other downturns most other downturns have the following characteristics they kind of happen on little cat feet and then things start picking up but its a slow kind of descent into that and the other thing is so often there are structural problems this is an economy point but structural problems in market that sort of bleed to that and then the resolution of it needs to fix those structural problems on the way to fixing all the other problems that come from it so i think whats so extraordinary about this is the just swiftness of this thing and the fact that its really the entire world going through this and the sort of vertical descent from an economy point of view that happened so quickly so things that im struck by on the consumer behavior side i have been really struck at the early behaviors that i see that are consistent with the model that we have believed let me back up for a second and say theres a saying that i used to that ive said for years is that consumers are a lot more rational than the institutions who serve them including the financial institution whos served them often over the years i have always been struck over the years despite all the things that are written and speculated about consumers just how rational they are and so i was struck during the great recession at their rationality there was some irrationality before the great recession this time around the consumer was in a solid very balanced shape going into this downturn and the little things that i have seen behaviors on the savings side on our bank side behaviors on the payment side the purchase volume side even on the delinquency side of things and what i see is a rational consumer and i think that what we all should think about as we calibrate to any other recession this is a downturn that came to the whole world right at once and its a downturn without a bad guy thats the other part of this thing and so whats the implications of a downturn without a bad guy is its a lot easier politically to mobilize solutions for consumers thats a political and economic point but i think that is going to be a good guy in this downturn and its resilience the other thing the other final thing ill say about human behavior or the behavior that weve certainly seen i am amazed ill talk about our company this is really a point about consumers point about people i am amazed how productive people are and we just did an associate all associate survey and engagement and morale is still at very high levels people are all in theyre engaged and the productivity is extraordinary from people working from home it doesnt mean that everybody when the world opens up everybody is going to just stay home capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2020 but i think that back to my earlier point i think theres a compression in years in the learnings and the behaviors associated with digital and i think every companys going to walk away from this experience struck by the extraordinary productivity that or certainly most companies or certainly ones that are digitally in a good position by what just happened on the productivity side and that is some learnings for all of us there jeff norris a senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp next question please operator and our final question will come from brian foran with autonomous brian foran q analyst autonomous research hi i know the calls gone long but just on the opex totally understand pulling the target given how much flux there is but on the core effort of moving to the cloud and retiring the data centers is any part of that core expense dollar effort and timing changed or is it more just revenues in flux maybe some call center volumes and stuff like that has the data center strategy changed at all i guess is the crux of the question richard d fairbank a chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp no not a single bit i mean we are incredibly well served by our move to the cloud the ability to scale up for some extraordinary things that have happened so many things so the cloud strategy the technology transformation everything about it we felt this experience is validating with respect to the data center exit itself we are on the very same timing of later this year i mean we are already fully in the cloud so what but the data centers are still open because there is you think once you get out well then you just youre done but there is a period of much of a year to actually do all the wind down activities associated with the data center so were in the cloud and the wind down is going right on schedule and were talking later this year and the associated economic benefit of those moves jeff norris senior vpglobal finance investor relations capital one financial corp okay well i think that wraps it up for this evening thank you for staying with us thank you for joining us on the conference call today and thank you for your interest in capital
