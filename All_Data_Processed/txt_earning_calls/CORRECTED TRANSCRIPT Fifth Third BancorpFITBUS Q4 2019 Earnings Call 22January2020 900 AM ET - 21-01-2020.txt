reported record full year net income of billion or per share full year adjusted net income of billion was also a record for the bank as i reflect on the past year i am very pleased with the significant progress we made to position fifth third for longterm success in addition to the record net income we generated our best full year core return on tangible common equity excluding aoci in over a decade up basis points from last year we produced our lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade which decreased basis points from last year we generated peerleading household and deposit growth all while reducing deposit cost during the year also during the year we successfully integrated mb financial we added significant scale in the chicago market and expect to generate even stronger deposit household and revenue growth going forward we successfully navigated the evolving interest rate environment as our full year core net interest margin expanded basis points after expanding basis points the year before which is at the higher end of our peer group we generated record fee income including corporate banking as our capital markets business generated double digit revenue growth for the second consecutive year we also generated record revenue in wealth asset management while generating positive inflows every quarter during the year net chargeoff and other key credit metrics remain at or near historically low levels throughout the year we generated nearly billion of excess capital through worldpay transactions in which is yet to be deployed and we returned over of adjusted earnings to shareholders in through a increase in our dividend and through share repurchases in summary we are extremely pleased with the progress we have made and expect to build on our strong performance in and beyond for the fourth quarter net income available to common shareholders was million or per share reported results included a positive primarily from the successful worldpay tax receivable agreement transaction completed during the quarter since the spinoff of our processing business years ago we have generated over billion in pretax value for our shareholder with another million remaining in tra income which we fully realized over the next five years tayfun will discuss the fourth quarter tra transaction in more detail our fourth quarter financial results were very strong reflecting our prior north star investments to further diversify our revenue streams improve balance sheet management continued expense discipline and our success in achieving the targeted financial outcomes from the mb financial acquisition weve generated very strong fee revenue including a new record in capital markets our net interest income results once again reflect our ability to successfully manage the balance sheet despite the lower rate environment which led to strong nim performance in the quarter we continue to manage our expenses diligently this reflects our continued focus on generating efficiencies throughout the bank while still investing in highpriority areas to support revenue growth we remain on track to achieve the million in annual savings from the mb acquisition by the end of the first quarter of and are excited about the revenue synergies that are emerging fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 loan growth during the quarter was consistent with our previous guidance reflecting the generally subdued macroeconomic environment total commercial loans were stable and consumer loans were up sequentially following our trend we successfully generated strong core deposit growth while proactively reducing deposit costs more than our previous guidance our average loan to core deposit ratio of is the lowest in over years credit results during the quarter were partially impacted by our conversion to a national charter excluding this impact net chargeoffs were up just basis points sequentially with consumer flat and commercial up basis points provision was primarily impacted by growth in specific reserves related to a couple of commercial loans before i turn it over to tayfun to discuss our results and outlook i would like to once again emphasize our strategic priorities to outperform through the cycle and generate longterm shareholder value as i mentioned we have been very successful in executing our priorities throughout and have delivered on our targeted outcomes as expected we will continue to focus on these priorities going forward including leveraging technology to accelerate our digital transformation investing in talent capabilities and process improvements to generate relationship growth and improve profitability continue to expand our presence in select geographies focusing on highgrowth markets we are investing in the southeast footprint with better deposit growth trends higher expected population growth and greater market vitality and lastly we are focused on maintaining our disciplined approach throughout the company to that end our capital allocation priorities are organic balance sheet growth feegenerating nonbank acquisitions paying a strong dividend and share repurchases bank acquisitions are not a priority our medium term cet1 capital target remains at approximately we plan to increase our dividend another this quarter subject to board approval we expect to execute our remaining buybacks from ccar our clearly defined strategic growth priorities our proactive balance sheet management and our ongoing discipline throughout the bank position us well for the future we continue to focus on striking the appropriate balance in order to generate positive operating leverage this year while continuing to invest for longterm performance im pleased to report that we were again able to deliver strong financial results our strong performance this quarter was a direct result of our employees hard work and dedication to keeping the customer at the center of everything we do with that ill turn it over to tayfun to discuss our fourth quarter results and our current outlook tayfun tuzun chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thank you greg good morning and thank you for joining us today lets move to the financial highlights on slide of the earnings presentation we are pleased with our overall financial performance and strong finish to a strong year similar to the trends all year during the fourth quarter our net interest income net interest margin noninterest income and noninterest expenses all performed inline or better than our october guidance fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 reported results for this quarter were positively impacted by per share from several notable items the most significant was a million aftertax gain from the worldpay tra transaction which added approximately basis points to our cet1 ratio similar to all of the strategic decisions related to our legacy processing business over the past years the tra transaction creates significant value for our shareholders by monetizing gross cash flows that were previously expected to occur primarily from until consequently we are also no longer exposed to fiss taxable income capacity in the future related to those cash flows and we still have multiple years of annual benefits impacting our fee income in the future we provide more information on the transaction in our presentation appendix in addition to the tra transaction reported results were also affected by a million aftertax negative mark related to the visa total return swap a million aftertax contribution to the fifth third foundation and a million aftertax impact from mb mergerrelated charges additionally our quarterly results were negatively impacted by a million aftertax impact to provision for credit losses resulting from our conversion to a national charter our earnings materials provide more information on the various credit metrics that are affected by this conversion adjusting for those items and the purchase accounting impact shown in our earnings materials fourth quarter pre provision net revenue increased from the prior year our core return on tangible common equity excluding aoci also increased basis points from the prior year to while our tangible book value per share increased from last year our goal is to carry the revenue momentum forward while maintaining tight expense control we will continue to manage balance sheet risk by remaining cognizant of the environmental factors and maintain a prudent approach to capital management with the ultimate goal of rewarding our shareholders today and in the future moving to slide total average loans were flat sequentially as consumer grew and commercial was stable from the prior quarter our focus continues to be on generating higher quality loan growth to maximize our returns through the full cycle in our commercial business similar to last quarter strong production levels in both regional middlemarket and corporate banking were offset by elevated payoffs we have experienced higherthanusual payoffs this quarter in our leveraged lending and structured finance portfolios as well as in our construction portfolio new loan production in regional middlemarket banking has increased every quarter since the first quarter of our new loan originations particularly in cincinnati chicago and florida were strong in the fourth quarter total commercial line utilization was stable in commercial leasing our balances continue to decline due to our decision to hold new originations in our largeticket indirect segment and focus on driving relationshiporiented growth we expect to see lease balances decline by approximately million by the end of as a result beyond this impact should be lower average commercial real estate loans were up from last quarter primarily reflecting draws on priorperiod commitments our cre balances as a percentage of total riskbased capital remained very low at less than fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 commercial loan growth will likely remain relatively muted in the nearterm reflecting the subdued environment for corporate capital investments we will continue to maintain our focus on client selection and prudent underwriting in the best longterm interest of our shareholders average total consumer loans grew from last quarter predominantly driven by strong auto loan production of billion within the same risk return profile that we have targeted for the past number of years the decline in home equity balances continues to reflect high levels of payoffs and pay downs our credit card growth continues to track inline with the industry the residential mortgage portfolio was flat sequentially we expect this portfolio to remain flat for the foreseeable future barring any significant changes in the interest rate environment in the first quarter we expect total average loan balances to remain relatively stable sequentially for the full year we expect average loans to increase approximately relative to last year with growth in both commercial and consumer portfolios moving on to slide reported net interest income declined compared to the prior quarter the purchase accounting adjustments benefited our fourth quarter nii by million and our net interest margin by basis points compared to million and basis points in the third quarter adjusting for purchase accounting accretion nii was relatively flat with just a million decrease sequentially interest income benefited a couple of million dollars from seasonal dividends the adjusted fourth quarter nim of decreased basis points from the third quarter adjusted nim which was better than our october guidance of down to basis points our relative nim performance throughout this rate cycle has been outstanding our focus on reducing our overall interestbearing liability costs to offset the impact of lower market rates remains very high interestbearing core deposit rates were down basis points during the quarter better than our previous guidance range of to basis points we expect interestbearing core deposit costs in the first quarter to decline approximately another to basis points from the fourth quarter assuming the fed remains on hold combining our first quarter forecast with the results of the past three quarters we will achieve a cumulative basis point decline in interestbearing core deposit costs since the fed started lowering interest rates last year resulting in a beta on a core basis we expect first quarter nim to expand to basis points from the fourth quarter core nim of reflecting the increasing benefit from the forward starting hedge positions that became effective over the past few months for the full year we continue to expect core nim to be consistent with our october guidance and down just basis points from our core nim assuming no fed rate cuts this year for the full year we currently expect net interest income excluding purchase accounting adjustments to increase approximately we expect our first quarter net interest income excluding purchase accounting adjustments to decline approximately sequentially impacted by day counts and the relatively stable loan growth outlook our first quarter outlook also assumes partial reinvestment of the investment portfolio cash flows which may change depending on the environment moving on to slide we had a stronger quarter in fee income than we guided to in october adjusted noninterest income decreased only sequentially as deposit fees and corporate banking fees performed better than expected offsetting a portion of the seasonal decline in mortgage revenues continuing its recent trends fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 corporate banking fees exceeded our guidance our capital market teams generated record revenues this quarter up from the third quarter for the full year our capital market fees were up following a yearoveryear growth in we are very pleased with the second half revenue strength in capital markets especially the growth from our regional banking clients activities our focus on client selection and deepening those relationships is working well to diversify our revenue streams the power of our one bank model which engages all business lines in meeting our clients needs is very visible in our financial results we generated very strong growth in corporate banking revenue in relative to reflecting the investments we have made in our north star project in talent and in advanced capabilities to better serve our clients as we anticipated the return to those investments will continue to reward our shareholders mortgage banking revenue decreased to million sequentially and increased relative to the fourth quarter of origination volume of billion was up from the prior quarter our gain on sale margin was basis points in the quarter impacted by seasonally lower application volumes in the quarter and tightening primary secondary spreads wealth asset management revenue increased from the prior quarter due to higher personal asset management fees we finished the year very strong in new aum flows and expect this trend to continue in deposit service charges were up this quarter with higher fees in consumer as well as commercial we expect a stronger year in in our consumer and commercial deposit service charges based on the trends that we are seeing our noninterest income results demonstrate the increasing benefit of having a platform with a wide scope of product and service capabilities for the full year we expect core noninterest income growth of approximately relative to the adjusted level of billion including the expected worldpay tra benefit in the fourth quarter we expect first quarter noninterest income to decline approximately reflecting seasonally lower mortgage and interchange revenue our first quarter forecast also does not include any investment gains in total as a result of nii growth and strong increase in fees we expect to achieve a very strong total revenue growth in moving on to slide fourth quarter reported pretax expenses included mergerrelated items totaling million intangible amortization expense of million and a contribution to the fifth third foundation of million adjusted for these items and prior period items shown in our materials noninterest expense was flat sequentially we remain on track to deliver on the previously provided outlook for mbrelated expense savings we continue to expect to achieve million in savings by the end of the first quarter of additionally we expect our total aftertax merger charges inclusive of the mergerrelated charges recognized in current and past periods as well as projected future charges to be approximately million aftertax which is million lower than our deal estimate as is always the case for us our first quarter expenses are impacted by seasonal items associated with the timing of compensation awards and payroll taxes excluding these seasonal items we would expect our total expenses in the first quarter to be down approximately sequentially fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 total first quarter expenses including the seasonal items are expected to be up approximately from the adjusted fourth quarter which also includes the full impact of the raise in our minimum wage to an hour although in the shortterm the increase in minimum wage is dilutive in the long run we expect to achieve a stronger financial outcome through lower turnover improved workforce quality lower recruiting expenses and more effective training for the full year there are a number of discrete onetime changes including the impact of the minimum wage increase and the increase in direct regulatory fees related to the occ charter conversion in addition we are planning to continue to rationalize and modernize our technology infrastructure which will result in additional in year expense growth relative to our recent trends these three unique items are expected to increase our total expenses by approximately we are anticipating a minimal increase in discretionary expenses outside of these items excluding these unique items affecting total expenses should increase less than in total including these items we expect total adjusted expenses to increase between and compared to adjusted noninterest expenses of billion which reflects growth in expense items tied to strong revenue performance that i mentioned regardless of our 12month outlook which calls for positive operating leverage resulting from strong revenue and disciplined expense growth in this uncertain macroeconomic environment we intend to maintain flexibility to achieve positive operating leverage under potentially less favorable economic conditions we recognize that as we navigate through the environment investments in projects with lower returns may be deemphasized or delayed in order to focus our capital investments in the highest areas of importance within the four strategic corporate priorities turning to credit results on slide due to our national charter conversion fourth quarter credit results were impacted by accounting policy changes to conform to occ guidance regarding certain assets which resulted in an increase in tdr and oreo balances these changes increased consumer npls by million and npas by million which added basis points to the npl ratio and basis points for the npa ratio the same change resulted in a onetime million increase in chargeoffs all within our consumer portfolio excluding the onetime occ impact net chargeoffs remained at historically low levels during the quarter the consumer net chargeoff ratio was flat and commercial was up basis points sequentially the adjusted npa and npl ratios continue to be benign and inline with the levels that we have seen all year the alll ratio increased slightly to of portfolio loans and leases driven largely by two factors the larger portion of the increase was due to higher specific reserves for two middlemarket commercial loans in two different industries we expect these loans to go through our resolution process in the first or second quarter we also increased the allowance in our credit card portfolio as the incurred loss methodology captured the uptick in historical loss rates as we discussed before the higher credit card loss rates are related to growth in certain promotional test portfolios which are expected to run off and result in more normalized chargeoffs towards the end of the quarter end of the year card chargeoffs were actually down basis points this quarter compared to third quarter with respect to the cecl adoption which is in effect as of january the day one adjustments will result in an increase of approximately to or between million and million to our allowance for credit losses which includes reserves for unfunded commitments and is below the upper end of the range that we provided in october fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 as a reminder this increase includes the impact of the mb acquisition accounting methodology pertaining to our nonpci loan portfolio and the cecl treatment of reserves which adds more than to the increase that i mentioned as discussed previously excluding the impact of mb we expect reserves for commercial loans to decrease and consumer and mortgage loans to increase relative to the incurred loss methodology we plan to include a full description and transition details in our upcoming 10k disclosure consistent with peer banks who have recently commented on the impact of cecl given the number and potential volatility associated with the underlying variables supporting the cecl methodology we expect more volatility in our quarterly provision expense our calculations for the allowance for credit losses rely on various models and estimations techniques utilizing historical losses borrower characteristics economic conditions and a reasonable and supportable forecast as well as other relevant factors for the expected losses in our reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years we will use three macroeconomic scenarios from there we assume losses revert to historical levels over a period of two years on a straightline basis given the multiple variables impacting provision expense under cecl we will be providing forecasted net chargeoffs for the foreseeable future overall we expect our full year chargeoffs to remain near historically low levels and be in the to basis point range which is up just a few basis points compared to the to basis point chargeoff rates that we have seen in the last couple of quarters again i would like to remind you that the current economic backdrop continues to support a relatively stable credit outlook with potential fluctuations in losses on a quartertoquarter basis given the current low absolute levels of chargeoffs turning to slide capital levels ended the year very strong our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio excluding aoci was our tangible book value per share was this quarter up yearoveryear during the quarter we completed million in buybacks which reduced our share count by approximately million shares or about of our common shares outstanding compared to the third quarter we expect to execute the remaining approximately million of repurchases over the remaining two quarters in this ccar cycle between the worldpay sale gains in the first quarter of and the impact of the recent tra transaction we have nearly billion of additional capital above our initial expectations as we proceed into the ccar exercise as we discussed in the last quarter the pacing of our preferred dividends has recently changed in light of our september issuance and the conversion of existing preferred stock to floating rates with quarterly payments we expect our preferred expense to alternate between million and million every quarter going forward assuming no issuances or change in libor slide provides a summary of our current outlook in summary i would like to reiterate a few items our fourth quarter results were strong and continue to demonstrate the progress we have made over the past few years towards achieving our goal of outperformance through the cycle our execution on the mb acquisition is on track fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 to meet our targets on both expense and revenue synergies as always we remain intently focused on successfully executing against our strategic priorities and remain confident in our ability to outperform through various economic cycles with that let me turn it over to chris to open the call up for qa chris doll directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp thanks tayfun before we start qa as a courtesy to others we ask that you limit yourself to one question and a followup and then return to the queue if you have additional questions we will do our best to answer as many questions as possible in the time we have this morning during the questionandanswer period please provide your name and that of your firm to the operator dkitria please open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking my question gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey scott tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey hey tayfun just wanted to ask about the fourth quarter provision you gave some detail on the items impacting it in addition to just the move to the national charter but you had it sounds like a couple of commercial credits and then the impact from the credit card portfolio as well tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 just as you think about things sort of on a goforward basis how much of that proves transitory and how much is if any is sort of a new run rate in other words if it was higherthanexpected this quarter do some of those kind of revert back down or whats the best way to think about it tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure scott i will make a few comments and ill turn it over to frank for the credit piece we believe that clearly these couple of credits that just happened in one quarter impacted the provision numbers which we believe to be transitionary if you look at our guidance for next year we are clearly expecting continued stability and benign credit performance away from sort of the accountingrelated changes in our credit metrics this truly was just one of these quarters where a few credit loans came up but frank do you want to comment on that frank r forrest a chief risk officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp tayfun i will and scott we talked about it before the commercial business and ive done this a long time is lumpy the nature of the business is lumpy one quarter doesnt make a trend in either direction in the commercial business and its something that you manage over an extended period of time these two credits are not related to each other theyre both kind of core middlemarket companies companies actually weve banked for a long period of time ones a retailer ones in the hospitality sector theyre going through a workout they happen to hit at the same time but if you revert back to the year and if you look at our overall again results for the year were actually very pleased with the asset quality for the year as we said before our criticized assets came within our expectations for the year our outlook for has really not changed other than maybe a to basis points increase just given the economy and overall our non performing assets for the quarter were centered on these two items the million net flow at the end of the day when we think back to the work weve done in the company intentionally over the last four years weve repositioned this company to be strong through operating cycles and were highly confident im highly confident weve done that these are middlemarket credits the increases weve actually seen for the year in our problem credits have been tied to kind of the lowerend middle market a lot of thats reflective of repositioning the rating system from mb some of its in our systems as well but those credits tend to be very wellsecured and historically have a low loss rate and its a very granular portfolio which is what we like to see when you think about the portfolios at least in my experience where we you should be concerned as you think about the economy when an economy slips its commercial real estate it would be your large corporate book and it would be leverage and when you think about our commercial real estate book we have the lowest concentration of commercial real estate loans of any of our peers and that portfolio has performed exceptionally well and we position it with companies today that are basically national and large regional developers that are essentially investmentgrade or near investmentgrade with a lot of liquidity our large corporate books performed exceptionally well our shared national credit book very low level of criticized assets and its very diverse we manage the risk exposures there i think very prudently and when you think about leverage leverage in our case weve been focused on reducing that for now for four years weve reduced over billion in leveraged loans in the last four years which is a decrease that we feel very good about the remaining leverage book we have today fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 we have specialized groups that lend to that sector both in the line of business and theyre tied together with specialists that we have in risk and we manage it prudently we monitor it prudently so our overall thesis i suppose is that when you think about the portfolio of what fifth third has done over the last four years weve completely repositioned this portfolio for success and were highly confident that that work will project itself as we move forward in and beyond under any economic scenario r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay thats helpful i appreciate that and then separately tayfun i was curious on the gain that you got from the change in the tra agreement do you guys have the same flexibility to repurchase shares with that gain as you do under kind of a more traditional if you were to just sell shares and get an aftertax gain that way tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp not with the gain that we booked i mean we typically go to the fed with a specific request but clearly the first quarter gain on share sales we are able to buy back shares with that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp but obviously this gain that we booked in the fourth quarter goes into our overall capital ratios which gives us a better starting point for the ccar exercise r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay perfect thank you tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure operator and your next question chris doll a directorinvestor relations fifth third bancorp dkitria are you there operator yes next question comes from the line of ken usdin with the jefferies ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 thanks good morning guys gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc can i ask a question on the right side of the balance sheet you talked about loans growing this year im wondering if you could put the deposits into context in terms of the mix of deposits and what type of growth youre expecting on the deposit side overall thanks tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i suspect thats a ill turn it over to jamie with details as well we obviously have had a very good year both in consumer as well as commercial deposits in we expect that our stable growth in consumer accompanied by good growth in households will continue we do expect a stronger year in commercial deposit growth as well because we have a good amount of focus on the partnership between our treasury management group and our commercial deposits jamie anything that you want to add james c leonard a treasurer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah and ken this is jamie one of our goals this year is that we do match loan growth with deposit growth and so for us we would expect core deposits to be growing similarly to the loan side at tayfun mentioned our focus is really improving the share of wallet that we get on the commercial side of the aisle because historically retail as you know has been a very strong provider of deposits and funding for the company over the years so our focus is getting commercial up to those levels so we would expect commercial to outperform those numbers and then on the retail side it will be a little bit less than that number in part because were intentionally running down our cd portfolio and repricing a lot of those higher cost cds around or so right now repricing them down into the range so we are driving those deposits out the door which results in a little bit lower retail deposit growth number however you see that benefit show up in our deposit costs both in the fourth quarter as well as a big support for what we expect in the first and the second quarter of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and maybe as a followup on the first quarter outlook you talked about down nii but you did indicate that you expect the core nim to be up and loans stable so can you help us flush out what the other deltas would be in terms of you mentioned the seasonality of securities and some of the deposits like what else what it seems like that there wouldnt be so much of a drag on fourth to first james c leonard a treasurer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah from a nii dollars perspective the fourth to the first is really driven by day count of million then higher wholesale funding costs and the impact of seasonal runoff in ddas thats about million and then the fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 investment portfolio we expect to be down about million from the elevated fourth quarter levels the fourth quarter levels include a lot of the yearend onetime mutual fund dividend amounts and that was million and so the other portion of the investment portfolio reduction is that we did not reinvest cash flows in the fourth quarter and as tayfun mentioned given where rates are right now we dont expect to reinvest all of our portfolio cash flows in the first quarter so well be opportunistic if things change we certainly have the capacity to reinvest but right now were running portfolio at about of total assets and thats well probably be in that to range over the course of the year tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah maybe this is a good point for us also to add that for the year our nii guidance for the year basically assumes a fairly flat even maybe a slightly down average portfolio balance so for those of you who are modeling investment portfolio numbers for our decisions on the investment portfolio tend to be very opportunistic but for now as we sit here at the beginning of the year were not anticipating an increase to investment portfolio balance if we do see opportunities if the environment changes that clearly will have an impact on the actual performance when we get to the end of the year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks guys operator and your next question comes from john pancari with evercore isi gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning on the cecl front the if you could help us think about how provision on a day two basis could shape up in terms of either on a quarterly basis as we go into or how we could think about it on a full year basis on how its impacted by the adoption thanks tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp sure yeah i mean i think the progress in our reserves and the impact on the provision numbers is probably very similar to others except for when you look at whats driving the higher reserve rates it really is the longerdated loans and some of the consumer credits outstanding we as you know have been very clear on our expectations with respect to the residential mortgage portfolio we do not intend to grow that portfolio not necessarily because of cecl but just because in the current interest rate environment i dont think that were getting paid to grow that and home equities have been declining thats another portfolio that has a relatively large increase under cecl compared to the incurred methodology so those two portfolios should not contribute much in terms of increases in reserve coverage the one portfolio that we continue to grow is auto now auto cecl is also higher than auto fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 incurred loss so that should have a slight sort of increase but if we continue to grow our commercial book as we have done so in the past thats our biggest book and we will continue to grow that i suspect that our coverage ratio ultimately will not change much from sort of where we are standing but were all going to have to wait and see how this plays out it is without having not even a quarter under our belt it is very difficult to establish good reliable trends given the impact of these various macroeconomic scenarios that we will be applying john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it okay thanks tayfun and then separately on the mb side just want to see if you can give us an update on banker retention i know there was some concerns about that a few months back on some of the headlines that indiscernible indicated that you were retaining a majority of your targeted employees as a part of the deal you mentioned that last quarter i just want to get an update on that front and where how thats been progressing thanks gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp and john thanks for the question this is greg first of all we feel really good about the talent that we have in the chicago market as evidenced by the strong production numbers that were seeing from chicago as you would expect we have a target of million of expense reduction so a lot of that reduction shows up in the form of individuals indiscernible expenses and so forth that did not have jobs offered to them so a lot of that attrition you would expect to see that i would tell you in general 80plus percent of individuals we offer positions to or with the company have remained we feel really good about that and our ability through our expense targets that we modeled in this attrition is exactly where we would expect it to be so theres no surprises here weve also taken a bestofbreed approach so when you think about leadership in that market right mitch feiger is the ceo we retained the bestinbreed we thought to run that company theres redundancy theres optimization thats going to occur you would expect certain individuals to look for other opportunities as we modeled in so it is very much inline with what we expected theres no surprise here and well achieve the objectives weve mentioned but more importantly the outcomes in chicago we look at our retail franchise our wealth business and our strong strong core middlemarket production were really excited about what were seeing there and also the revenue synergies as they start to come together as we integrate that business into the rest of our business whether it be assetbased lending leasing capital markets into the old mb book we feel really good about what were seeing there and were very bullish on ability to accomplish our objectives that we set forth in that market but theres no surprise here john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thanks greg i appreciate it gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 okay operator and your next question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp ph thanks ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and just in terms of corporate banking obviously youve had really good success over the last couple of years with that business and i know your fee growth is obviously higher for in general but could you just talk specifically about corporate banking in terms of what youre expecting from that line i mean is that like how far forward can we continue to expect sort of those doubledigit gains im just trying to understand whats sort of transitory versus more of a sustainable growth rate gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp ken ill add to this and then ill turn it over to lars for a little more color on this first off when you go back and think about our north star commitments a lot of those investments were in corporate banking capital markets area and those investments we said will start to materialize from a revenue perspective in youre seeing that strength in continued strength in we continue to invest in that area because once again it provides the products and services we need to better support our clients and weve had a great team assembled and we continue to make great progress in the area so we would expect that performance to continue on as we look into and beyond so lars let me give you that lars c anderson a chief operating officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah ken were really pleased with how the north star investments foundational have really played out we shared with you in particular the replatforming of our frm business were already seeing the benefits of that you can actually see that in our foreign exchange performance this quarter frm business is really coming back its strong but in addition to that a real focus on our advisory model our relationship banking model and aligning our businesses to both our middlemarkets focus as a company as well as our industry verticals to be an advisor a consultant which that meant that we really needed to go after the investment banking piece of capital markets and that is paying big big dividends for us today so an example of that would be coker capital that we acquired and that perfectly aligns with our advisory approach to the healthcare industry most recently you saw the fact that we recruited investment bankers in san francisco it aligns with our renewables and solar business so thats the theme here is to continue to build out a broad platform to serve the industries geographies and segments that we plan to win in now look we may not be able to control the ultimate loan growth quartertoquarter or yeartoyear because there are macroeconomic impacts on that but one thing we can do is bring them advice solutions and those are fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 often tied towards our fee products and services and youre seeing that come through in our corporate banking success im really proud of the talent that we have ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thats great and then just maybe one followup question for tayfun you mentioned that youre going to have higher regulatory expenses related to the charter change in as part of that extra expense growth next year is there any seasonality related to that im trying to figure out like whats again sort of what sort of unusual or first half kind of driven expenses versus this just permanently increases your expense base thanks tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah there is not ken theres about million million just the direct fee that we pay to the occ its just thats the marginal increase in direct costs but there is no seasonality to that ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc and its just an ongoing expense going forward tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp thats correct right the change is a unique change yearoveryear but it will be in our expense base going forward ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc perfect all right thank you tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp good operator your next question comes from the line of erika najarian with bank of america erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp good morning erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 i just wanted to reiterate maybe the point that you made earlier if the nii or the noninterest income revenue outlook fell short theres room to pull the expense lever and potentially do better than the to range to achieve positive operating leverage for tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah so we clearly we have always intended to in the past number of years to achieve it we achieved it every year and we continue to keep the same target and when you look at the contents of the remaining expenses beyond that sort of the unique change erika clearly our largest expense is in compensation and there is an underlying inflation built into that and that consumes over a point of that expense increase and in addition there is also another point or so in expense increase related directly to revenue growth so if the revenues sort of tend to come in slower than we expect we believe that it will be reflected on expense growth as well and then were going to have to make some choices as to where to invest and where not to invest to wait out a slower revenue growth environment erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning gregory d carmichael a chairman president chief executive officer fifth third bancorp hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i was wondering if you could talk a bit about just commercial borrower sentiments you did mention that the payoffs were quite high in and had a somewhat muted outlook for commercial lending i think it was the first quarter but it seems like maybe commercial or corporate sentiment is improving maybe its just literally the last few weeks here but thats one of the themes that weve been hearing from some other banks and maybe some of the things in the credit market has pointed out as well so are you seeing some early signs of that or is it a little bit of a different customer base for you guys than maybe were seeing elsewhere lars c anderson a chief operating officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah matt so first of all just to address the first quarter there are seasonality issues in that so i would really be looking to tayfuns guidance for the year thats what were focused on is executing in there has been a heightened sense of caution as we have moved through the second half of with some of the global tensions tariffs those kinds of things but some of the resolution of that were beginning to hear some positive things were seeing some activity levels that are reflected in the pipelines not just from a lending but also from a fee solutions perspective that is giving me a little bit more confidence as we look at and a potential pickup in fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 activity levels there so frankly im not looking at with a lot of concern i feel like that we can go out there and execute given where we have positioned our resources in the southeast and middlemarket banking in industry verticals but in summary theres still a sense of caution but i would describe it as positively migrating as you see a number of things start to play out in the global marketplace and with some of the trade tariff activities recently completed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then just separately you reiterated kind of your interest in additional fee deals youve talked about this in the past just remind us kind of which areas youd most be looking to complement and are they sizable enough that you kind of hold back a little bit of your capital versus your target or theyre just not going to be meaningful enough to really impact the kind of capital and buyback story thank you tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes the capital decisions are independent from that matt i mean because the timing of these availabilities are random weve in the past were very clear lars mentioned the confidence that we have in our advisory businesses in commercial we clearly if we come across opportunities to even grow our advisory ma services et cetera we will be looking for those a long time ago we started talking about potentially adding more capital markets capabilities in commercial real estate as they may become available we will be focusing on those we have invested in our asset management business there are opportunities that are financially feasible and rewarding we will be looking at those so it is going to be more business commercialoriented feeoriented opportunities but at this point what we do with the capital that we have is somewhat independent of the opportunities if we see the opportunities we will execute them regardless of whether were sitting on billion of capital or not matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you operator and your next question comes from the line of saul martinez with ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning guys first i wanted to clarify a couple of points on credit first on the commercial side you obviously mentioned the specific allowances for two commercial credit you also had a big increase in npl formation in commercial i think million on page i think frank you mentioned that was also related to those two specific credits but i just wanted to confirm that was the case and also on cecl tayfun just again a clarification and i have to sharpen my pencil on this but i think your allowance takes your acl ratio to like bps i guess what youre saying is that obviously theres volatility there are more things driving quarterly provision but your best guess at this point would be that it sort of stays in that range and yeah we should be modeling provisions with chargeoffs and growth is that sort of the right way to think about it so a couple of questions more a clarification question fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp ill take the cecl one and then ill turn it over to frank i think your numbers are right in the ballpark saul and yes i mean sitting here looking at sort of balance sheet progress without necessarily having a perfect knowledge of macro scenarios i can only assume that its probably going to stay around those levels but obviously after a couple of quarters under our belt we will be able to give you a more precise answer on this frank on the credit side frank r forrest a chief risk officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yes saul on the million your question was is it inclusive of the million and the answer is yes it was saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc okay frank r forrest a chief risk officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp and just as a reminder in the workout business things are lumpy i mean its you dont package things up in a neat package and you have even inflows and outflows we look we analyze inflows every quarter in detail and look to see if theres any particular trends that are bothersome to us and we didnt see anything there in particular it spread out i will say the flip side of that is we had a really strong quarter on collections so our net at the end of the day was million which i think about as sort of those two credits that were there before so thats the story there and again it doesnt i dont think portend anything different in our outlook for we feel very good about based on where we sit today saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc great thats really helpful thanks a lot guys operator and your next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning just want to followup on tayfuns comment earlier in the call about the accelerated pay downs of leveraged loans and other commercial is that attrition going to continue do you think or would you look to replace those loans this year tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah our intent is not necessarily to grow the leveraged portfolio to make up for the faster payoffs we will make loan decisions independent of the payoffs but lars any comments on that fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 lars c anderson a chief operating officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp yeah no so actually going back to a previous question just so that you understand the build that you see and we have seen both in middlemarket in corporate banking increasing volumes of loan production throughout the year and that is really encouraging which i had mentioned about so with my optimism on the flip side and part of the muted impact in the ultimate balance sheet a softness in the industry that were seeing has been pay downs elevated pay downs however the complexion of that changed in the fourth quarter in the fourth quarter rather than just deleveraging some of our portfolio what we saw were the two biggest drivers was number one higher risk assets in the leveraged lending portfolio where we actually saw a decline there and thats a positive thing its strengthening our balance sheet and its not that we will not extend credit into the leveraged lending market but were being very disciplined and selective in that market the second piece of it goes back to what frank said earlier we saw pretty significant pay downs in our construction lending line of business which i shared previously in prior calls that we expected that that would begin to occur as a sign of a healthy commercial real estate portfolio late in the cycle so maybe a little bit more than you asked but to kind of frame it we do not see that leveraged lending will be a growth area for us or a period of time this late in the cycle christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great lars thats really helpful background thank you both for the comments operator thank you and your final question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thanks for taking the followup i just wanted to ask on your greensky relationship i notice you guys had renewed that relationship just at a top level any changes to how youre thinking about appetites for those types of credits or and then i guess more specifically were there any changes in the terms as a result of that renewal tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer executive vice president fifth third bancorp i cant necessarily yes we renewed the relationship and we renewed the relationship having had the experience with greensky over the past couple of years and having seen a fairly stable credit performance having said that we believe that the renewal actually benefits us in the way it was done the way it was structured from a credit support perspective as well pricing perspective thats all im going to comment given the fact that they are the counterparty to the agreement but we feel pretty good as to where we ended during the renewal discussions r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co fifth third bancorp fitb corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 okay all right thats sounds great thank you tayfun tuzun a chief financial officer
