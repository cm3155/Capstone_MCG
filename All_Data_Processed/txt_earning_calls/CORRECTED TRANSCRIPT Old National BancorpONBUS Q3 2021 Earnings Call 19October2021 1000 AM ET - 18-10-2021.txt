commercial pipeline core deposits grew nicely by million during the quarter our net interest margin was stable capital markets and wealth management revenue were strong and mortgage revenue rebounded from last quarter old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 expenses were well managed and down slightly primarily due to onetime benefits from incentive in real estate tax accruals credit quality metrics remain benign with another quarter of net recoveries adjusted roatce was a strong and the adjusted efficiency ratio was during the quarter we worked hard with our clients on the ppp forgiveness process of round loans have been forgiven by the sba and we already have of round loans through the forgiveness process remaining fees totaled million most of our reported credit quality metrics improved during the quarter we have reduced our reserves consistent with our modeling as a result of the improving economic conditions we still have approximately of reserves supported by qualitative adjustments given the longterm impacts from the pandemic expectations for higher inflation persistent labor supply and supply chain challenges as we gain additional clarity around these issues we may develop more confidence in moving our reserve closer to day one cecl levels a quick update on hiring we continue to add significant talent during the quarter especially on our wealth management team this was highlighted by three key individuals that joined our wealth team from the former wells abbot downing group including jim steiner who started abbot downing and who will now assume the role of our chief investment officer the team will help expand our high net worth and institutional services they opened the scottsdale arizona wealth management office to better serve the growing number of clients in that area we also hired two new commercial relationship managers in st louis to build upon our recent success in that market our talent pipeline remains strong and we will continue to hire talented team members moving to slide which contains a quick refresher on some of our accomplishments and next steps with our merger with first midwest both companies have tremendous integration history and experience and as a result our work is going well we have precision and communicated most clients segment and support areas organizational structures and leadership weve also settled on our core processing system along with the most of the supporting applications we remain on track for a second quarter system conversion you probably saw first midwest earnings this morning the results for the quarter were strong and consistent with expectations we also received support from our special shareholder meeting and first midwest shareholders provided a similar level of support weve also received occ approval our application with federal reserve remains pending with the board in washington dc along with the merger applications of many other bank holding companies we stand ready to close quickly once we received final fed approval you may have seen that we were sued by the fair housing center of central indiana a nonprofit advocacy organization with a history of filing lawsuits alleging lending discrimination we strongly and categorically deny the claims in this lawsuit regarding certain of our lending practices old national is committed to engaging in fair and equal lending practices a testament to this is that we have been named one of the worlds most ethical companies for the past decade as is customary for us and many public companies i am unable to comment further on this pending litigation lastly despite potential distractions from the lingering pandemicrelated issues and our transformational merger we have remained focused on serving our clients and communities and i think our results illustrate the success of those efforts i will now turn the call over to brendon old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 brendon b falconer senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you jim turning to slide our gaap earnings per share and our adjusted earnings per share were both adjusted earnings exclude million in early mergerrelated charges which were largely offset by million in debt securities gains slide shows the trend in commercial loans and the related commercial pipeline and production trends all excluding the impact of ppp loans q3 represents our fifth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth and over that year commercial outstandings have grown our strong commercial production of billion was once again led by our louisville and minnesota markets with all other regions posting quarteroverquarter growth our balance sheet production was also well balanced by product with a split between cre and ci respectively commercial activity remained strong throughout the quarter and we were heading into q4 with a very healthy billion pipeline with almost million in the accepted category turning briefly to pricing new money yields on commercial loans increased from prior quarter which meaningfully narrowed the gap between new production and portfolio yields the investment portfolio increased million this quarter as deposit growth once again outpaced total loan growth we continue to put much of our excess liquidity to work in our investment portfolio with new money yields of and a portfolio duration well within five years moving to slide both period end and average deposit balances increased nicely from q2 levels with most of the growth coming from business clients in the noninterestbearing demand category total cost of deposits for the quarter was unchanged at basis points while total interestbearing liabilities declined basis point from q2 next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margin net interest income increased million quarteroverquarter excluding the impact of ppp net interest income increased million which is the third consecutive quarter we have outperformed our stated objective of holding nii stable through earning asset growth net interest margin increased basis point to from prior quarter and core margin excluding accretion in ppp declined just basis points to slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income adjusted noninterest income of million in q3 was million higher than the second quarter our wealth line of business continues to be a bright spot and is on pace for a record year our capital markets business had another strong quarter and mortgage revenues rebounded nicely following the pipeline valuation decrease in q2 while mortgage production was down slightly in the quarter an increase in the size of the pipeline and stabilizing value resulted in a million increase in revenue this increase was partially offset by a million decrease in gainonsale income as margins continued to normalize next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million the quarteroverquarter improvement was driven by an accrual adjustment to incentives as well as the reduction in real estate taxes both of these items are not expected to recur turning to ppp loans on slide you will see a roll forward of those balances which stood at million at quarterend we continue to assist clients for forgiveness and approximately of round and of round loans are now formally through the sba forgiveness process unamortized fees on the remaining loans totaled million we anticipate half of the remaining loans will be forgiven and the related fees recognized in the fourth quarter of old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 slide shows our credit trends the quarter proved to be another good one from a credit performance perspective 30plus delinquencies ticked up basis point but remained at a new cycle low of basis points with respect to chargeoffs we were fortunate again this quarter to be able to post a net recovery mostly due to the resolution and full recovery of a previously written down senior living credit the nonperforming loans to total loan ratio was once again hit a new cycle low at basis points while this metric remains higher than peers the net chargeoffs to npl ratio is significantly better than peers we believe our approach to identifying troubled credits early and our patient approach to work out results in better outcomes for our clients and ultimately lower costs for the bank on slide you will see the details of our third quarter allowance which stands at million a decline of million from q2 the improving economic outlook and the positive trends in credit quality support a modestly lower reserve level and while our outlook on credit remains optimistic we recognize the economy has not fully recovered and it made the decision to maintain our higher level of qualitative reserves which stood at million at quarterend as a reminder we also continue to carry million in unamortized marks from our acquired portfolios as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we are very pleased with the fundamental results of the quarter strong commercial loan growth led higher core net interest income despite interest rate headwinds our feebased businesses led by wealth mortgage and capital markets continue to perform well and in line with expectations expenses remained wellcontrolled and our strong credit quality continues to keep credit costs low slide includes thoughts on our outlook for we ended the quarter with a healthy billion commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth this historically low interest rate environment will continue to put pressure on net interest income which should be mitigated through continued earning asset growth the ppp loan forgiveness process continued for our clients we expect the run off of approximately half of the round balances to occur in the fourth quarter with the recognition of the related unamortized fees to occur at that time we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well we were encouraged by the momentum in our wealth business and the strong commercial activity should help maintain the high level of performance in our capital markets business mortgage revenue should follow industry trends and be seasonally lower in the fourth quarter our other fee lines are expected to be stable in the near term we would expect to see a million increase in noninterest expenses in the fourth quarter given the nonrecurring items impacting our third quarter performance lastly a brief update on taxes we continue to expect a reduction in the volatility caused by our tax credits as we work through the last of the remaining oneyear historical tax credit commitments in total were expecting approximately million in tax credit amortization for the year the corresponding fullyear effective tax rate of approximately with that we are happy to answer any questions that you may have and we do have the full team here including jim sandgren daryl moore and john moran old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group your line is open benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning guys james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc good morning i just wanted to take a moment lets assume that the deal closes in the fourth quarter which it probably will so theres going to be a lot of noise in integration over the next so lets call it six months so are there any areas in which you feel like theres a lowhanging fruit or opportunity to grow loans outside of chicago i know that the minnesota market was an area of pretty healthy growth in that playbook post those two deals a couple of years ago it seems to be chugging right along so i was just kind of curious if you could talk about some of the opportunities that you see that present themselves right away and kind of what you are focusing on that two to threeyear goal either footprintwide or chicago itself james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp yeah ben this is jim sandgren yeah youre exactly right minnesota continues to be a bright spot and we see that as opportunity to grow in the future louisville kentucky continues to be really good for us indianapolis and some of those markets i know jim talked a little bit about st louis which is a newer market for us which has seen some nice growth and then obviously with our partnership with first midwest i mean we see big upside when we get together with them in the chicago area bigger balance sheet so looking forward to really grow throughout the footprint james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah i think ben one of the things that attract us from first midwest is they have spent more time and theyre ahead of the game in terms of building out some niche verticals i think those niche verticals help us we can export those across our footprint and maybe give us new opportunities that we werent looking at today and i think we can continue to use that bigger balance sheet across the entire footprint to create new opportunities for us benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got it thats helpful and then in terms of the noninterest income it seems like everything was moving in the right direction if you look at it from the momentum perspective mortgage rebounded wealth continues to be old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 strong i was curious is there any areas in which you are kind of doubling down the reinvestment i know that there are some recent hires in wealth management capital markets continues to perform well is there any areas in which its potentially punching above its weight and we could see some reversion to the mean or is everything kind of operating as is and we should expect similar results for the next year or so james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well longterm we continue to believe wealth management as a source for us as well as the treasury management business coupled with a strong commercial business which means capital markets as well i think those are the three areas that we continue to believe mortgage will just be cyclical and itll just drive along with everybody elses mortgage business but those three areas in particular and we really havent seen the benefits of our new hires in that wealth management business yet were carrying the cost for those new hires and its not only the three new hires we just talked about but weve been pretty consistently hiring in that area and so long term we believe were going to drive higher than our trend line kind of growth in those areas benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay thats helpful color i will ill step back in the queue and congrats on a solid quarter james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks good to see you got first again benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc thanks operator thank you our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp sorry scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co jim jim jim ill just add to the list of ways ive disappointed people so apologies well no i appreciate you taking the question just as we sort of look at this the strong loan growth you guys have been generating just curious if you could maybe make a comment or two about what your commercial lenders are seeing in terms of things like pricing and structure and how you guys are responding to that james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp sure yeah scott this is jim again its really competitive out there but the good news that weve talked on a number of the last few quarterly calls is that weve been out calling and working with our customers and prospects and building really strong relationships old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 so i will tell you credit structure is getting a little crazy so we continue to stay disciplined there pricing i think were doing a good job meeting our pricing hurdles quarteroverquarter so its tough right now theres no doubt about it but again i think because of the strong relationships weve had and the fact that weve been out calling throughout the pandemic and as we came through it i feel like thats how it kind of support the growth and i think were set up on the fourth quarter with a really nice pipeline and a nice accepted portion of that pipeline as well so pretty encouraged james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp and scott you know this well i mean were glad we give up a few points of growth to stick to our discipline around pricing and structure so were going to play a long game here to make sure we stay true to our history and roots r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay thank you and then just switching gears a little hiring talent away from some of your competitors thats been a big part of the story over the last couple of years just was curious jim if you can maybe add some comments about so what youre seeing in terms of cost to attract new talent and if you could speak to sort of the notion of wage inflation overall within the bank james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah its a good question were certainly not immune to wage inflation at all levels and we intentionally raised our minimums a year ago and so a lot of that cost is built into our current run rates and clearly going out and attracting high caliber talent away is more expensive than kind of the average price we pay today but we think again these are longterm investments that we believe are going to pay high dividends and so were going to make those investments and just be really thoughtful and deliberate about it and we have got a great story to tell and that story resonates so well with so many people today where they can see themselves being successful in our organization and being able to take care of the clients and really do their best to work and so we keep telling that story the price that we have to pay is not unreasonable and we think its good for the longterm health of our company r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right thank you guys very much i appreciate it james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good morning everyone jim maybe start with a question for you youve been involved in a lot of ma transactions with your time at old national bank could you just talk about just the level of discussions with regulators how indepth are they as it relates to getting first midwest closed just given the size and the structure and essentially what im getting at is maybe a soft way of asking what is the risk that the moe gets postponed given changes in the regulatory landscape james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp its really hard to tell terry there is no outstanding questions we have with any regulatory agencies and in particular the fed obviously we have occ approval and i think like many other bank holding companies were in the queue and were just waiting for that approval process we think weve answered any questions they have for us and really dont have any other feedback and theyre not waiting on any new information from us so were just going to continue to be patient and thoughtful i think the most important point though is we continue to work on the integration efforts which are really scheduled to happen in the second quarter so none of that work stops we continue to build relationships with each other we continue to do strategic planning with each other so none of that really stops we just keep moving forward and well wait for be patient and wait for the final regulatory approval and then as soon as we get that well close shortly thereafter terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc appreciate that and then as a followup you used to provide average loan size within the commercial portfolio im just wondering has that changed following the onb way and industry verticals and are you competing now kind of upmarket for larger deals thats contributing to some of the at least the dollar growth that were seeing in the commercial portfolio james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp yeah ill give some highlevel commentary and ill let jim get into the details but its certainly on average higher just as we entered larger metropolitan markets most notably when we entered wisconsin and minneapolis specifically i think weve just seen that trend to move higher even having said that i still think its pretty granular on average and today jim were running what was the average recently here james a sandgren a president chief operating officer old national bancorp so for ci were at about from a portfolio perspective and commercial real estate about a little over so to your point its still very granular terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thank you guys old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp thanks terry operator thank you our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is open james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody jim i think i want to start with loan growth typically when moes get announced theres a little bit of market apprehension about pro forma growth rate you guys had solid growth first midwest had a little bit of growth this quarter how are you thinking about the pro forma profile of the company especially with the economy recovering james c ryan a chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp i think both organizations are going up every day go out talk to its clients service communities right and loan growth will be somewhat dependent on kind of the status of the economy right but i think the loan growth that weve been putting up and producing is the kind of loan growth we ought to be able to put up and produce in a normal kind of economy or even slightly warm economy that we have today right so while we havent given any specific guidance i think what you see is what we should continue to produce we do think there again theres upside relative to the total balance sheet and our whole limits will potentially increase in the future plus leveraging those industry verticals so i think theres great opportunities for us to continue to grow the loan portfolio christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then on the deposit growth you and some of your peers i think have spoken about just the surprise factor of the deposit saying on balance sheet and continuing to come in with that confidence can you speak to kind of the pace of investments securities investments you might make youve grown the bond book a little bit in last couple of quarters just trying to see an outlook for that thanks brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris we continue to put the excess cash to work were actually sitting on a little more cash this quarter than last quarter and well be thoughtful as we put that to work given the outlook on the rates but our bias is to put more money to work than us christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then maybe if i could sneak one in on once you close the deal you guys have a ton of capital maybe updated thoughts on returning capital through buybacks old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2021 brendon b falconer a senior executive vice president chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah our capital priorities will remain the same look at the current valuation we think theres a great opportunity to return money to investors via share repurchase we have an authorization outstanding today thatll take us through the end of the year and well be looking for an opportunity to make use of that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thank you operator thank you im showing no further questions in the queue james c ryan chairman chief executive officer old national bancorp well thank you all for your support as usual lynell and brendon and the whole team is available to take any followup
