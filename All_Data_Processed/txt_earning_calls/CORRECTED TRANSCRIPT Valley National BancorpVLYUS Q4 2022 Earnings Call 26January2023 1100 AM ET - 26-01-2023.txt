bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 thank you travis and welcome to those of you on the call i have a few comments to make this morning and then we have tom to provide insight on the quarters loan and deposit results mike will then discuss the financial results in more detail in the fourth quarter of valley reported net income of million earnings per share of and an annualized roa of exclusive of noncore charges adjusted net income eps and roa were million and respectively in we generated net income of million and adjusted net income of million this represents a significant increase from as a result of strong organic loan growth the acquisition of bank leumi usa and the benefits of higher interest rates that were realized for the majority of the year i am extremely proud of valleys consistent financial performance throughout my tenure as ceo our profitability metrics and earnings per share have increased steadily across a variety of economic and competitive backdrops despite the negative impact of interest rates on equity in and completing the largest acquisition in our companys history our focus on tangible book value resulted in yearoveryear growth in fact our stated tangible book value has increased since this compares to a increase for our proxy peers over the same period and a increase for valley between and our value creation as measured by tangible book value plus the dividends we have paid has totaled since this is over times our proxy peer median of we have generated real franchise value on both an absolute and relative basis within the context of our sustained financial success i want to focus this morning on what i see as our key accomplishments over the last five years and how the evolution of our company positions us for the years ahead from a balance sheet perspective we have done a tremendous job diversifying our funding base at the end of approximately of our deposits were held in retail branches by focusing on commercial relationships in both niche and digital deposit channels only of our deposits are from the branch network today from a geographic perspective of our total deposits were in new jersey or new york branches in today that number is down to just of total deposits finally despite a challenging few quarters cds and borrowings comprise just of funding today versus five years ago our focus on geographic diversity and a holistic approach to commercial relationships has benefited the asset side of our business as well in of our loan portfolio was in new york and new jersey currently less than of our loan portfolio is in these states the ongoing addition of higheryielding and increasingly adjustable loans has helped to better align our asset and liability betas in our view this increased balance should help to reduce the net interest margin volatility that we have experienced in prior cycles ultimately our sustained credit excellence provides a stable foundation upon which the aforementioned transformation could occur our premier asset quality will continue to be the hallmark of our organization this credit strength is the result of both stringent underwriting criteria and a focus on holistic relationships with wealthy and sophisticated commercial clients heading into we have not identified any underlying trends which would indicate meaningful stress on the loan portfolio in any event we believe that our experience during the height of the pandemic indicates the exceptional resilience of our borrower base in aggregate the balance sheet transformation that weve undergone has been a direct result of our companys strategic evolution and targeted ma activity we have focused on business and geographic diversification valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 premier customer service and establishing a sustainable organic growth engine our hiring efforts and tactical initiatives have aligned with these outcomes and we feel wellpositioned to navigate the nearterm operating environment headwinds that we face today over the long term we will continue to focus on diversification and sustainable growth we believe the progress made over the last five years will drive our continued success and ultimately benefit our associates customers and external stakeholders with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp thank you ira slide illustrates the quarters annualized loan growth while quarterly loan originations remain below peak levels net growth continues to benefit from slower payoffs and more sustained activity on the residential and consumer side our commercial loan growth remains welldiversified across asset classes and geographies we continue to experience significant repeat business from our longstanding and sophisticated commercial borrowers legacy leumi customers have also benefited from the utilization of our more robust product set and balance sheet resources we anticipate that customer demand will wane somewhat in largely due to the impact of higher interest rates still we are wellpositioned from a competitive perspective to capture highsingledigit loan growth for the year our continued focus on attracting and retaining top talent and preserving service excellence positions us well despite a potentially more challenging backdrop on slide you can also see the 99basispoint increase in average new origination yields to during the quarter we remain successful in passing rate hikes through to our customers and anticipate further expansion in origination yields in the near term as a reminder approximately of our loan portfolio is fixed and another reprices over a period beyond days these pockets should provide a repricing tailwind that will continue to support increasing portfolio yields as rate hikes slow before moving on to the deposit side i wanted to provide some additional color on the quarters net chargeoffs approximately million of the quarters chargeoffs were related to a single ci loan both legacy valley and leumi has participated in this larger syndicated credit our combined loan exposure had previously been classified as nonaccrual and the remaining exposure is fully reserved for as of this is a discrete credit event and the vast majority of our portfolio continues to perform extremely well and as ira mentioned our underlying credit trends remain very strong turning to slide you can see that deposits grew at an annualized rate of approximately during the quarter while the quarters net growth was largely funded by brokered alternatives we are pleased with our ability to effectively defend our traditional deposit base in this challenging environment while we saw noninterest deposit pressure across business lines the largest single driver of the quarters reduction occurred in our technology deposit area despite the volatility of this business which has been exacerbated by certain environmental challenges we continue to add customers and accounts and anticipate above average growth over time as a reminder our technology deposits contribute approximately of our total balances as we indicated last quarter we are experiencing competition for deposit sources across the franchise specifically on the commercial side the same wealthy and sophisticated customer base that supports our strong valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 and consistent credit performance has been actively requesting competitive deposit rates this has incrementally pressured our betas and deposit costs our retail network has been responsive to our cd offerings and both digital and cannabis deposits saw solid growth during the quarter we are keenly aware of the price competition that we face to defend and grow our deposit balances a variety of channels remain available to us and we will do our best to take advantage of the most cost effective alternatives to support our continued loan growth with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide more insight on the quarters financials michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you tom slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends net interest income increased approximately million or from the linked quarter this reflects continued loan growth and expanding loan yields which were partially offset by more robust interest bearing deposit growth and funding cost pressures while our fourth quarter fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined basis points to from the third quarter of our ppp adjusted margin remains basis points above the fourth quarter of during the quarter a basis point expansion in our asset yield was more than offset by a basis point increase in total funding costs the asset yield increase was driven by both the repricing of our floating rate loans and the significant increase in the yields on newly originated loans during the quarter we funded loan growth and our noninterest bearing deposit run off primarily with higher cost time deposits as you saw on slide we calculate accumulative yeartodate deposit beta of approximately as we noted last quarter deposit competition has accelerated rapidly and we have had to offer higher rates to attract funds to support our significant loan growth while we continue to benefit from asset repricing this is likely to be more than offset by higher funding costs in moving to slide we generated just under million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to million in the third quarter the reduction was primarily the result of lower swap income this was partially offset by stronger revenues from our trust wealth and insurance businesses we anticipate that our fee income could grow at a mid to highsingle digit pace using the fourth quarter annualized number as a starting point on slide you can see that are noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter or approximately million on an adjusted basis most expense lines were wellcontrolled during the quarter and the modest increase from the third quarter levels was partially the result of higher counterparty collateral fees related to certain hedging activities continued revenue growth helped drive our efficiency ratio to from in the third quarter we anticipate sustaining a sub50 efficiency ratio in and believe there will be opportunities to drive efficiency lower from our current level turning to slide you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters tom detailed the single loan relationship that drove the spike in net chargeoffs for the quarter we believe this was an isolated incident and are pleased with our aggregate basis point net chargeoffs to average loan rate for as a result of continued improvement in our underlying credit metrics and stability in the economic forecast our allowance for credit losses as a percent of total loans declined to at december from at september as a valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 percentage of nonaccrual loans the allowance increased to from at september and one year ago on slide you can see the tangible book value increased approximately for the quarter this was the result of our strong earnings and a modest improvement in the oci impact associated with our available for sale securities portfolio tangible common equity to tangible assets improved slightly as a result of the same factors our regulatory capital ratio has declined modestly during the quarter as a result of our strong loan growth we anticipate that growth will moderate in resulting in higher regulatory capital levels a year from now we lay out additional guidance items on slide for simplicity we based our forecast on full year results which only included three quarters of impact from bank leumi based on our current pipeline and expectations for a modest pullback in demand we anticipate loan growth of to this would result in net interest income growth of to we anticipate approximately to growth in expenses using reported less merger charges as a starting point this would imply a full year efficiency ratio at or below the mid49 level posted this quarter with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you question and answer section operator operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of michael perito with kbw your line is open please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i want to start drilling down on the margin a little bit appreciate the guide and the outlook and obviously a strong kind of end to the year im just curious though i mean i imagine you guys are assuming some more beta pressure on the funding side in the first half of the year but as we think about the thought process around a relatively stable nim for and asset yield improvements being offset by funding improvements are you guys also factoring in continued outflow on the noninterest bearing side or how are you guys thinking about mix because obviously ira your point is well taken about how much the business has structurally changed but is there still some kind of normalization to be had just from the environment that were coming out of ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and i think its a good question and ill turn some of the mechanics over to mike but i do want to rehighlight once again the macro change that we have in the funding base today and especially just out of that retail valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 footprint i know historically the northeast has been high on an absolute basis as well as high on a beta basis and to now have of our deposits just sitting in new york new jersey region versus before is dramatically going to change what the overall beta performance is but mike indiscernible some more details i believe michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think the thing to really keep in mind is we saw million roughly rotate out of noninterest bearing into interest bearing between third and fourth quarter and our expectation right now as we look into is that that will continue and hopefully it bottoms out into the high 20ish type range the reason that we think that is we bank a fairly sophisticated wealthy customer base and obviously we pass the line where theyre going to leave excess deposits in noninterest bearing also keep in mind that with that million that rotated we also had about million of excess with that in quotation marks deposits that we put on in the fourth quarter in anticipation of the feds two additional fed actions increases in the first half of so were getting out ahead of that a little bit and obviously those have a higher beta attached to them ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and i do want to really just add one of the things that we have done is continue to grow the commercial book as well if you look at a yearoveryear basis weve seen business checking account increase and obviously those have a lot of operating accounts associated with them so there really isnt as much excess deposits in some of those so while there is pressure i do believe some of the changes and focuses that weve had in the strategic areas are really going to inure to the benefit throughout michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great so taking that kind of all into context its fair to say that at this point when you guys are kind of guiding towards a stableish nim you could kind of conservatively assuming that some of the headwinds that occurred in the fourth quarter continue to occur in travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp hey mike i think when you think about this is travis when you think about our to loan growth guide and when you kind of take the fourth quarter run rate on nii and you figure out where the guide that were giving you is for youll see kind of closer to nii growth so were anticipating some amount of margin compression and dont forget too the first quarter obviously well have additional headwinds like the day count issue is going to cost us a couple of basis points there michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc correct yeah travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 as well so yeah i dont think were guiding necessarily to a stable margin i would say that if you factor it all together theres a little bit of pressure thats baked in here and its because of the factors that weve talked about michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc perfect okay great thanks travis and then secondly ira on the efficiency ratio and i guess just kind of a philosophical question but i mean do you think sub50 is kind of the new table stakes i mean as you guys try to manage your business from an investment standpoint and an roi standpoint in terms of like incremental margins indiscernible business customers and stuff i guess the question is this just the way we should be thinking about your business base case moving forward irregardless of where rates are yeah i guess ill just leave it there im curious what your thoughts are ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp id be disappointed if we run about on a consistent basis i believe even our forecast for this year continues to invest in strategic and this is really going to continue to drive franchise value for us i think we focus on expenses probably too much in certain areas if you go back to when i took over as ceo we had employees and billion of assets the first quarter thereafter today were sitting with billion of assets employees so weve had added employees over the five years and grown the bank billion and theres tremendous focus here on efficiencies process and making sure that were getting the most out of every single dollar that we spend on the expense side i think but to your point we have to build franchise value we are investing in our future of certain businesses that we think are going to continue to really grow and so the outsized performance so it is a balance for us but managing the macro number i think is something thats really important to everyone here within the organization michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc helpful perspective and then just i think one last one in and then ill drop back just the trust and investment fees were stronger than i was looking for at least in the quarter and i was just curious if you could maybe remind us what the fee structures there look like and depending like are they market dependent or are they more fixed or just any color there would be great just to have an idea of what to expect once we make some assumptions for next year ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp mike i think the fourth quarter pickup was partially related to dudley which has some seasonally backloaded revenues so that flows through that trust investment insurance line because of their advisory fees i do think our forecast for we assume that theres some continued improvement in that line in total because should the equity and debt markets normalize i think we would look for some improvement in our market based revenues so i think thats reasonable but we dont anticipate a significant obviously were guiding to mid to highsingle digit growth on the fee side so its not astronomical michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great okay and the dudley is that seasonal revenue something that you would expect to occur kind of on an annual basis towards the end of the year valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thats correct michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great guys thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you mike operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steve moss with raymond james your line is open please go ahead steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning maybe just following up on mikes question just here going a little further into the weeds curious where is loan pricing these days thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp i think when you its thomas steve when you look at our yield in the fourth quarter we increased that basis points to on a monthly basis we were just under for the month of december we continue to push our spreads up to counter the cost of our deposits it really will differ by asset classes more sort of anything else and as ira mentioned earlier were adjustable so well continue to benefit by the rise in shortterm rates on that of our portfolio tied to sofr prime and libor steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then just on the deposit side you mentioned growth in i think tech and cannabis here just kind of curious can you give a little more color on the trends there maybe size it up and how much is maybe noninterestbearing versus interestbearing thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 yeah again its a depositdriven business for us and we are focusing on the multistate operators we now do business with of them we grow accounts in doubledigits on a quartertoquarter basis i dont have an exact thing but were primarily noninterestbearing on our deposit accounts steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great and one last one travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance and business development valley national bancorp one thing steve this is travis we lump cannabis in with a couple of other niche deposit businesses so for us that would be cannabis hoa national deposits and digital in those four businesses in aggregate out of million in deposits during the quarter which helped to offset some of the other traditional kind of commercial deposit runoff and so that goes back to iras conversation about the transformation of the bank absent those businesses which are relatively new to valley wed be looking at a different deposit picture steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then last question for me here just curious any color you can give on the construction loan that was moved to nonperforming status type geography things of that nature thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah sure its tom again steve its a single loan based in new york city its a forsale construction project of six units three are contracted to be sold were awaiting the tco to close those sales upon the three sales we will be paid in full steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay appreciate the color thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets your line is open please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp good morning jon ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning jon valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc a question for you on the cd growth during the quarter ira you mentioned it used to be i think five years ago do you guys see any limits to that cd growth should we expect more of the same in the next quarter or two michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i think you will see slightly higher levels assuming that we have loan growth thats in excess of what our expectations are in the guidance and then brokerage cd market is very liquid for us and we will use it as a tool to fund up the balance sheet and manage our loan to deposit ratio but as travis commented earlier whats really important is the growth were seeing in these other niche sectors along with the fact that we did do another cd promotion in the fourth quarter that raised just about billion as well and while those are higher cost deposits as i said earlier trying to link it back to my earlier comment we expect those deposits will become cheaper assuming that the feds expected rate increases occur in the first half of ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and jon i mean i just cant reiterate enough the different levers that we have today that we never historically had when we talk about where we used to generate fund income indiscernible out of the branches it came out of the fhlb or it came out of the brokered cd market those were the three choices we had today to even to support the loan growth we have a litany of additional levers today and we have the flexibility that if we wanted to go to the retail cd market because we think thats attractive then thats where a portion of it could come from we have the ability to extend duration on certain things that weve never had before so the flexibility that we have today is astronomical compared to where we were before and i do believe over a period of time on a relative basis that thats going to help us manage our funding cost to a much better degree than what we were historically able to and when you look at the asset side of the balance sheet which they should be looked at in conjunction with the floating rate assets that weve been able to put on really helps dictate the types of funding that we want to do across the entire organization we dont necessarily look at one side of the balance sheet just in isolation jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah that makes sense i mean its a unique period ira right were in a period of maximum deposit pricing pressure right now and i understand that ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and then keep in mind i think as mike was alluding to we had a 60plus basis point runoff early right because of the asset sensitivity so there was an expectation indiscernible were going to see some increase in the funding cost that come along with that but like you said jon its unique its interesting right now but theres a massive franchise value that were able to build by adding loan growth and be able to indiscernible the funds to really support that valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay just one quick one on this topic and then i have one other one but you mentioned the tech vertical the declining deposits there was that a surprise and what drove that was it simply making a decision on rate or was that something else in there and what was the magnitude of that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i wont give you the magnitude of it but i will tell you what caused it what caused it was one customer in their portfolio that went ipo and as a result of that the bank that took them ipo received the deposits that we previously had and that should come as no surprise that is the life cycle of what happens inside of that tech business but overall our tech balances from the time we started to now are basically flat when you see most everybody else in that space have declines ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp which i think is a good thing i mean if you think about what youve seen from an industry perspective youve seen tech deposits come down because of cash burn and needs at the overall individual portfolio companies this is a great event if you think about it from a client perspective that there was ipo and really still even in this market generate some sizable returns from an investor base and i think it demonstrates the differentiation of what our tech business looks like maybe versus what some of the others do from an industry perspective jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay good and then maybe this is for you mike im not sure but buried in the in release theres a comment about talking about reserves a lower quantitative factor in the reserves and im just curious what was behind that was that related to the charge off or was that that something else that drove that and then just if you could give us some thoughts on the provision as well that would be helpful thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah youre really in the weeds on that one but the quantitative for the most part the quantitative adjustment was not an adjustment based upon economic assumptions because indiscernible so thats probably what you really want to get at its more a function around nuances in various loan pools that we use kind of management overlays is the way to think about it and then if thats good on the provision question all else being equal we definitely believe that we will be able to all else being equal well be able to maintain our current allowance coverage ratio of but its also important to note that from the time that we did cecl to where were at now were actually up basis points so we started cecl at basis points were at today and by our math the peer group is roughly down basis points so while youve seen massive releases and reductions weve done the exact opposite and clearly we could have done that if we chose to in the fourth quarter and we chose not to because i think its prudent going into this economic environment to try to preserve our allowance or our provision as best we can ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 and then maybe just following up on that i mean just to put it in simplest terms we didnt leave the reserve many of our peers did so its not unlikely that were not going to have to provide as much if the economy does go into recession compared to where the peers were jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc but just it doesnt feel like you guys are youre being cautious here but youre not necessarily seeing the erosion that maybe were all fearing is coming later ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i think were being cautious for the last five or six quarters where our economic conditions still had a much more significant weighting towards a recession than what everybody else did i find it unfathomable that people would drain their reserve basis points below cecl for the last coming out of the pandemic and put it down to that makes no sense to me so now where i think that weve been more conservative its absolutely more likely that were not going to have to build to the level that everybody else is they should have never dropped down below cecl from my individual perspective jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thanks for the help guys operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is open please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning steven michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so first following up on the nii guide the up to in within that guide what is the deposit beta assumption by the end of michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so through the cycle all the way through the end of is a cumulative deposit beta of valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc perfect and does that do you assume rate cuts in there by the way michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp hold on one second ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp sorry i just want to clarify like so when you look in just for simplistic terms because mike said it absolutely right but for simplistic terms like we wanted to give you the metric that would be comparable to the way we presented deposit beta in our investor deck so if you look at that and you rolled that forward to the fourth quarter based on our rate assumptions that cumulative deposit beta would be steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah got it but do you assume rate cuts in that scenario to get there whats the underlying rate assumption there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp there is one rate cut but its very late in fourth quarter so i dont think itll be very impactful steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay got it michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and thats based off of go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc no no no go ahead michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah its just based off of the current expectation for fed action so its not ours its a marketbased assumption steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then in terms of the funding strategy in terms of funding the loan growth in im hearing somewhat mixed messages right you have these lowercost niches which helped this quarter but youre relying more on brokered cds and cds how do you see the mix evolving through and is it going to skew valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 materially towards these higher costs or do you think you could keep about the same mix but because of the growth youll get out of the lowercost verticals michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so in our comments we made a comment around noninterestbearing rotation that could possibly reduce that number as a percent of total deposits down to something in the high so i think the answer to your question is yes we expect a further rotation out of noninterestbearing i think that we expect a continued growth in those niches based upon different aspects that happened with interest rates throughout the year that will help fuel the loan growth that we expect and fund that loan growth but to the extent that those are shortfalls and we dont have enough funding i think brokered is probably the first place that well go and weve been doing that so i think its just a continuation of demonstrating what weve been doing steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay so if we put this together and think about the nim being under pressured at this point from the nim do you think its sort of down fairly consistently quarteroverquarter through the year is it more pronounced in the first half then you get to some level of stability in the second half michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so i think the pressure right now and nobody has a crystal ball this is really hard to try to figure this out i think the pressure will be more pronounced there may be some lag but i think itll be more pronounced in the first half of the year and then youll see a plateauing hopefully if in fact the future rate curve is actually realized and then youll see a plateauing and then maybe later as we said earlier later in the fourth quarter you get a slight reduction that wont be meaningful because of the timing of that cut steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc we recognize how uncertain it is thats why were asking so many questions ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp yeah i do think steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc indiscernible ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp but just keep in mind if youre looking at it on a relative basis right i think the day count is really going to impact where we are from going into so i think our comments are acknowledging that when you think valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 about the pressure were going to see just in the first quarter so not all the pressure is really from a funding base but just really that day count piece as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc awesome got it and then just one separate question on credit theres obviously a lot of market concern on commercial real estate given the rising cap rates and im just curious looking at the detail that you could provide on slide of the deck one do you share the markets concern over commercial real estate more broad and maybe could you drill down if you are concerned is that a particular geography or a product id love to hear your commentary on that thank you thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah steven its tom we certainly share the concern of segments of the markets in real estate we still continue to see robust growth of people moving into the southern markets especially florida a lot of our real estate growth is coming down in that florida market to support that migration of people down there as you well know we are a very diverse granular book of business we dont have a sizable concentration in any segment looking at our real estate portfolio our average weighted average loan to value is our debt service coverage is ph so we do look at this very closely our cap rates weve always stressed at higher cap rates than our competitors our average cap rate is around but youll go through different categories and asset classes and as an example when multifamily cap rates were being were in the range we were stressing at that allows us to obtain what i will consider lower leverage growth in our markets and keeps down that weighted average ltv and debt service coverage and we underwrite to cash flow we dont underwrite to collateral value steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for all the color ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thanks steve operator thank you and one moment for our next question our next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning had a question on cds you noted that customers have been responsive to your cd offerings can you expand on what terms youre putting on i mean i know you were selling them out in the past so has there been any change in the duration mix given that were closer to the fed holding rate steady or potentially cutting and if you could also help us with how much of the cd portfolio will likely is likely to reprice in the next couple of quarters valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah this is mike so our retail cd promotions that basically started in the middle part of and continued into the fourth quarter have all been around or 18month duration so were not going out long on the curve because obviously related to the answers we gave to earlier questions around our expectation for rates is that we do expect rates to come down in the very very end of and obviously spill over into were also trying to build a fairly flat maturity schedule so that we dont have any one quarter where you have a lot coming due so generally to months and weve been very fortuitous on those offerings so that while at the time they might have been a little bit on the high side the high beta side when you look back now where we are with rates after the basis points of fed increases you now look at those as being fairly good funding for us actually fairly cheap in some cases now the one we did in the fourth quarter was obviously on the more expensive side of that and thats public so i can definitely tell you where that was at that was at and it raised just under billion manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it very helpful and then apologies if i missed this but i think last quarter it sounded like you were tightening lending standards a little bit can you talk about how you what are you doing this quarter and how you feel about ph credit going in ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp oh yeah yeah im sorry we consistently look at our lending standards and our criteria and we began tightening those standards early on in the pandemic and to remind everyone of our business is to our existing customer base that have been through the ups and downs in the economic cycles so we manage our we never compromise standards to grow we maintain our standards and as weve talked about before we typically use higher cap rates to evaluate our loantovalues manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens your line is open please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning everybody ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning matt valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc a couple of quick ones first what was the accretable yields for the quarter and whats the outlook for accretable yield in michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so matt we said the third quarter was million on the loan side that ticked up about million this quarter and we anticipate i think we said that million to million is a good run rate on a quarterly basis and that remains kind of our guidance matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then what is just give us some outlook for the securities portfolio in and whether or not you see much of any growth or should it match kind of overall balance sheet composition stay the same michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so as a reminder it represents a little less than of our earning assets so its not a material driver of income nevertheless that portfolio is very high quality and remember the majority of that is held in are held for maturity so 75ish percent and so the is only held in the afs portfolio i dont really expect a lot of changes i guess the biggest change youve seen probably just an industry change has been that any kind of payouts have ground to a halt and so you have very little coming due that way what we will add is in the highestquality ranges and probably in the lowest riskweighted asset ranges and well keep pace obviously as a reminder we have a lot of public fund money in this bank as well and government banking as a niche for us is an important niche so we do have to have collateral for that business so we will continue to maintain at a minimum what we have matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then ira just would love your thoughts in around ma previously the message was look we got a ton of stuff to do organically theres plenty of opportunity on that front i felt like ma would have to be incredibly spectacular for you to do it but my read was probably not just wanted some updated thoughts there ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp i would probably say you could copy and paste back into the comments for this quarter as well i think were very fortunate that we are likely an acquirer of choice a partner of choice for many people that are out there today which is wonderful i think based on the experience and successes that weve had maximizing and focusing on tangible book value is something that ive always talked about from day one when i became ceo and that really continues and today when you look at the economic environment i think its very difficult to do an ma transaction that isnt necessarily just a resource stream but really drains the tangible book value as well and thats not something that im comfortable with doing valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 outside of that i do believe that we have such tremendous opportunities on an organic basis that we should continue to focus on those resources we still need to continue to convert and get some of the synergies associated with the bank leumi deal and theres tremendous opportunities with that so like i said probably copy and paste matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood lastly just thank you for adding the expense guide for appreciate that addition to guidance thats all i had thank you ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp anything for you operator thank you and one moment for our next question and our next question comes from the line of frank schiraldi with piper sandler your line is open please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co hi guys ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp hey frank how are you frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just on that good good thanks just on the niche businesses i think tom you talked about sort of the way you approach that you lump in the cannabis the hoa the national deposits and you mentioned a growth rate in the quarter just wondering as we think about those businesses maybe ramping up id assume that we could see greater contribution on a quarterly basis going forward and then just also curious is that largely low to no cost deposits within that umbrella a 06v6pfe tom iadanza yeah when you look at the individual component certainly weve been ramping up the hoa and thats largely noninterestbearing deposits we talked about the national deposits business thats primarily an interestbearing program and process there the tech will have a large portion of noninterest bearing but well have interestbearing mixed in there also and the plan on tech is really to broaden the users and have reliance in addition to domestic vcs to go along with the israeli vcs that were doing business with today there are other cannabis again will be multistate operators primarily a noninterestbearing program so yeah the plan is to ramp up our specialty our niche businesses focusing on the deposit side of it frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co and then on the technology deposits you mentioned theres been some volatility there but overall i guess its sort of flattish with where you acquired the business in terms of balance it sounds like and so can you give any valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 put any parameters around how volatile it has been i think you said of deposits right now and where thats gotten to over the last couple of quarters and do you see it just continuing to be volatile here in the short term michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thats a great question other than the ipo event the very discrete events that we talked about its not actually been that volatile for us we know from talking and listening to industry folks that in other portfolios it can be incredibly volatile but ours has not been now granted weve only had threefourths of a year of experience with it so you got to take that for what its worth frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and can you lump in there is that like a bank leumi umbrella i mean do you lump the private banking that you got from that acquisition in with those technology deposits or how has that growth rate been for you guys michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp no the private banking both international and domestic is not included in technology frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and have you seen a contraction in that business or do you have any the size the relative size of that business at this point michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah so i think weve said this before the international business from a deposit perspective is larger than the domestic business and the domestic business is going to grow this is one of the synergies that we identified as part of the leumi acquisition will grow because of the private banking business that we have on our side the legacy side of the business i should say the international private banking business has had some reduction in deposits the good news is remember thats both a deposit and an aum business and for the most part their value add has been structured notes and obviously the market has not been conducive to that so weve been able to retain those clients by moving the vast majority of them into treasury securities and then in a different interest rate environment i would expect some of those as they mature to come back on balance sheet thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp and just one thing to add in the last six months weve had over million of referrals from the legacy valley customers into the domestic private bank for assets to manage and its a constant flow of consumer loan business that comes out of that private bank portfolio into valley valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just lastly sorry if i missed it but could you give any more color on the participation i thought i heard you mention that you wanted to leave and i think you mentioned leumi in there as well but just want to make sure i heard it right with the partial chargeoff indiscernible thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah yeah certainly so this is a customer that again banking with us in so almost years we began with a million share and a total million credit facility or company performed well over the years the credit facility grew to million since that inception we always manage our exposures and we increased our exposure from to but reduced our overall from to the company sells cardboard boxes for shipping produce their customers customer had a concentration to russian entities the embargo has put a very very big strain on their customers ability to pay them we saw that early on took early action we put this on nonaccrual early in and we reserved of the loan during this represents about a chargeoff of our outstanding loans isolated we do constant reviews of all of our receivablebacked loans to see if theres any stretching of payments on those and as ira mentioned earlier our credit metrics remain strong michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and its probably important to note that leumi had a piece of this as well so the combined numbers will be different because they had a piece frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay so im sorry leumi the american bank had a piece and so youre saying its larger your total michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp correct frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah yeah i was referring to the management of the valley total over those years when we acquired leumi they were also a participant in the bank group the chargeoff and the reserve represents both bank shares frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co got you okay thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q4 earnings call 26jan2023 operator thank you and im showing no further questions and i would like to turn the conference back over
