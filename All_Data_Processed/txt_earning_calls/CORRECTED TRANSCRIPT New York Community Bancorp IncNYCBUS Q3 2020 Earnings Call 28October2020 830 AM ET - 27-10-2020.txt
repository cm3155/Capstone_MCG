chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning to everyone on the phone and on the webcast and thank you for joining us today earlier this morning we reported diluted earnings per common share of for the three months ended september thats up compared to the year ago quarter and up compared to the previous quarter we are very happy with our third quarter performance especially given the uneven economic recovery and the lingering effects from the covid19 pandemic not only did our fundamentals and operating results continue to improve but we also experienced better asset quality metrics as npa declined along with a significant decrease in the number of loans on deferral our third quarter results reflect strong top line revenue growth and earnings per share growth on both a year overyear basis and on a linked quarter basis this growth was driven by solid loan growth and continued double digit net interest margin expansion this along with well contained operating expenses led to higher levels of preprovision net revenues at the same time our provisions for credit losses declined compared to the prior quarter more importantly the amount of loans in deferral declined significantly as previously disclosed our deferral program is somewhat unique in that it is for an initial sixmonth period as opposed to a threemonth period accordingly the overwhelming majority of loans on deferral were eligible to come off their deferral period during october and november from june to october of the billion of loan deferrals eligible to come off of their deferral period returned to payment status both multifamily and cre deferrals dropped compared to the levels at june with most of the improvement in the cre portfolio occurring in the retail and mixed use segments as of october our deferrals represented of total loans compared to as of june we attribute the substantial improvement in loan deferrals to our conservative underwriting guidelines and our proactive borrowers outreach program earlier on during the pandemic looking ahead we have an additional billion of deferrals scheduled to come off their deferral period billion of which are scheduled to do so during november given octobers strong payment performance we remain confident about deferral payment trends going forward moving now to our third quarter results we experienced another quarter of strong margin expansion excluding the impact from prepayment income the net interest margin expanded basis points to on a sequential basis and was up basis points on a yearoveryear basis this marks the fourth consecutive quarter of margin expansion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 since bottoming in the third quarter of last year our margin has improved basis points the margin improvement continues to be driven by a substantial decline in our funding costs our overall cost of funds during the third quarter declined basis points on a linkedquarter basis and basis points on a yearoveryear basis the decrease in funding costs was primarily driven by the downward repricing of our cds which resulted in an average cost of deposits of basis points down basis points sequentially and basis points yearover year at the same time loan yields declined only basis points compared to the previous quarter owing to continued stability in loan pricing net interest income for the third quarter rose to million compared to the second quarter and was up compared to the year ago third quarter during the last easing cycle our cost of deposits bottomed at basis points given the current rate environment and expectations we believe that this cycle our deposit costs will bottom below the level of experience during the last cycle given this and further repricing opportunities on the funding side of our balance sheet we are well positioned for additional improvement in both net interest income and our margin on the expense front total non interest expenses were million up compared to the previous and year ago quarters the increase was largely due to our bankwide systems conversion and covid19 readiness as we reopened our branches and of our employees returned to their offices despite the modest uptick in expenses the efficiency ratio improved to during the quarter and we continue to benefit from positive operating leverage an important metric to focus on is preprovision net revenues or ppnr ppnr for the third quarter was million up million or sequentially and up million or yearoveryear on the balance sheet front total loans were billion up million or annualized compared to the second quarter of the year driven by continued growth in the multifamily portfolio and a rebound in specialty finance lending offset by a decline in cre on a yeartodate basis total loans are up million or annualized the multifamily loan portfolio showed continued strong growth during the third quarter increasing million or annualized compared to the second quarter multifamily loan growth has been higher in each quarter over the course of the year this growth is the result of the following factors increased refinancing activity as many loans are nearing their contractual maturity date or option repricing date higher retention rates and market share gains as some bank competitors have either retrenched from this market or have deemphasized multifamily lending we were also pleased to see a rebound in the specialty finance portfolio during the quarter specialty finance loans and leases increased million compared to the second quarter of the year on a yeartodate basis this portfolio has grown million our originations for the quarter were robust total originations excluding ppp loans were billion thats down compared to the previous quarter but were up compared to the year ago quarter third quarter originations exceeded last quarters pipeline by million or as for our loan pipeline we continue to see strong borrower demand for our loans our current pipeline heading into the fourth quarter is billion included in the current pipeline is of new money on the funding side total deposits of billion were relatively unchanged compared to both the previous quarter and to the levels at year end in line with our strategy to reduce our cost of funds cds declined billion during the third quarter and billion during the first nine months of the year the majority of this decrease was offset by growth in each of our other lower cost deposit account categories our wholesale borrowings consisting primarily of federal home loan new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 bank advances increased million compared to the previous quarter as we continue to take advantage of the low interest rate environment and favorable capital market conditions on the asset quality front our credit metrics improved during the quarter reflecting the underlying strength of our loan portfolio during the third quarter of our segment of the new york city real estate market the non luxury rent regulated multifamily segment continues to hold up very well rent collections in this segment continue to be strong and have returned to prepandemic levels also we have not witnessed any material changes in residential vacancy rates in our multifamily portfolio with vacancy rates below as of september of the current quarter the provision for credit losses under cecl was million compared to million in the prior quarter and million in the first quarter of the year this quarters provision exceeded net chargeoffs by million during the current quarter we had a net recovery of compared to net chargeoffs of million or of average loans last quarter nonperforming assets as of september were million compared to million in the previous quarter this reflects basis points of total assets compared to basis points in the previous quarter excluding nonperforming taxi medallion related assets npas would have been million or basis points of total assets compared to million in the prior quarter or basis points of total assets we also announced that the board of directors declared a cash dividend per common share the dividend will be payable on november to common shareholders of record as of november based on the yesterdays closing price this translates into an annualized dividend yield of lastly id like to end my formal comments by once again thanking all those who continue to serve on the frontlines of this crisis and to our employees management and board who have shown extraordinary dedication and commitment during this difficult time on that note i would now ask the operator to open the line for your questions we will do our best to get to all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or this week new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 question and answer section operator and at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so of the billion that came up million asked for another additional assistance is there any reason why the next billion thats remaining we should not see a similar outcome where go back to paying so that the end yearend deferrals of about basis points or at least less than and then if you could add to that in terms of whats your expectation around the outcome of the ones that need the additional deferral into whats the loss content around those that you expect thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc hey ebrahim good morning joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc go ahead tom thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yes good morning ebrahim this is tom so let me just update you and clarify so we as of last night we have that has paid that brings the number down to million which remains unpaid and its still a probability that well collect on this money and therell be no second round deferral so were very optimistic that this typically runs in line with our normal payment structure and it looks not unusual after a month after quarter end so were very pleased with the outcome there may be some customers that decide to work with us and some indiscernible but the reality is that we do have flexibility under the cares act to deal with this million thats currently unpaid and going forward just to go back to your additional question we are very optimistic given that weve spent a lot of time on knowing whats ahead of us in the next three weeks so customers reaction to the various communication that we sent to them regarding payment status so we feel very optimistic that this will continue the first slug of money that came due which was that approximately billion in october the results are much better than what we all expected so were very pleased i think the reality is that the underwriting standards that are so strong and the low ltv and the fact that when were reanalyzing the cash flow when theres a request for additional relief its a very high bar now where the original covid19 relief was pretty much open to all customers if they choose to new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 so as i said in the previous call as an abundance of caution we were very liberal on allowing people to have the cares act relief but going forward the bar is very high and we do a significant amount of cash flow analysis to assume that if theyre going to get more relief they have to really need the relief so the good news is that as mr ficalora indicated the payment structures that are coming in and the collections are very high the delinquencies are very low right now for our core business model and were very pleased with the current results of the first chunk of large deferrals coming due by midnovember well pretty much ph work through through of all deferrals and we anticipate on updating the marketplace by the end of the sometime by the end of november on those results so we believe it will be consistent so were very pleased with what were seeing right now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that is helpful and i guess just taking a step back tom your stock is down about since july earnings theres a lot of nervousness on the new york city economy and real estate market looking out next year obviously youve been growing your multifamily book i think you mentioned rental collections are back to pre pandemic levels just talk to us as we kind of fast forward to the next to months what are you seeing from your borrowers as maybe people move out of new york like whats the level of concern around credit indiscernible as youre extending new loans and just how we should think about the losses for nyb thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so again we feel that the losses will be de minimis weve obviously adopted cecl this year so obviously were not typically ever had any real significant losses historically for the company but weve put up sizable provisions for our historical chargeoff history so clearly we feel highly confident that the provision will continue to be lower assuming that the macroeconomic backdrop continues to improve as were seeing so as you can see from the first quarter of the year where our cecl adoption was and going forward each quarter its been slightly lower i can see that trend continuing and possibly depending on how robust this collection efforts and then the amount of loans that are no longer on the deferral we may see some recoveries sooner than we expect given the magnitude of the other collection efforts and we really have a tremendous amount of people back on full payment status and thats not a guarantee for the future but clearly what were seeing in october we believe that trend will continue in november and as far as the overall risk we see i think the risk has shifted a little bit initially when we had signed up a lot of customers on deferral we write a little bit about mixed use and if you look where the mixed use is right now at the million commercial mixeduse portfolio were down to million on deferral thats a pretty sizable reduction and we should hopefully work through that in the next month and then when you look at whats left on retail retail has dropped substantially as well we have billion in retail and right now we have about million left on deferral which pretty much will work itself out in november so those indiscernible shift maybe into office obviously office there has been a lot of noise in office in new york city so we do have approximately million left on deferral with office interesting story with office we had a large customer that we had an indication that he may have difficulty paying and we contacted that customer and at the end of the day he paid ltv family asset class its something that his family generated over time and its a very low ltv and ultimately we had buyers with a note so if in the event for some reason we had to go that path we have people lining up at par to take the asset new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 so were low leverage lenders in particular in a new york city marketplace in manhattan and given that theres been a little bit of shift into office but retail has performed better than expected as is mixeduse so were very pleased with the portfolio indiscernible outside of our core product being multifamily as far as the multifamily is concerned its been very robust on the collection side ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i can sneak one more in just on the margin outlook youve given some disclosures around the debt and cds maturities if you could one talk to us in terms of margin outlook for the fourth quarter and maybe looking out further and what are the new cds coming on at and whats the new debt coming on at thank you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so let me be clear im not going to go into here lets just get through and we said all along we anticipated for the year to have continued double digit margin expansion throughout we believe in the fourth quarter was continuously the similar trends well have double digit margin expansion going into the fourth quarter which is very encouraging driven by as we as mr ficalora indicated the substantial drop in our cost of funds both cds and bonds we have approximately billion coming due in three months at million cost of funds marketplace between basis points and basis points thatll probably roll somewhere in between that level we have billion coming due from months on an outlook on cds at a million you bring it down between basis points to basis point depending where interest rates go which we believe rates will be going lower depending on the overall economic climate and a lower for longer reality in interest rates so if thats the case and the nontraditional banks continue to lower their overall cost of funds we will enjoy that benefit in addition to that as you indicated we have about billion of borrowings coming due next year at that money is anywhere from basis points to basis points if we refinance today and we have another million in the fourth quarter at million so these are all positive attributes to the continuation of margin expansion which we will enjoy in the fourth quarter and obviously going forward we think that the spreads are holding up on the asset side were still getting north of as far as our overall weighted average yield and thats a subject to the market so were still getting around that 300basis point spread over fiveyear treasuries for our core product mix on the asset side indiscernible ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc go ahead joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc recognize that in every prior difficult market we have substantially less losses than the marketplace actually realizes and when we look at our existing portfolio there is a high probability that we continue to be paid on our portfolios and that the realization of the losses that weve already booked as reserves is highly improbable new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 there is no reason to look to our history and suggest that those losses which are a cecl accounting losses that those losses will ever be realized thats an important thing for us to recognize from the standpoint of future period performance we have high probability of performing in the future period in the new york market rather consistently with how weve performed over every previous cycle yes there are nuances and yes there is a difference with regard to some of the properties that we have but still the likelihood that we would realize these massive amounts of charges is highly improbable ebrahim h q poonawala analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc thank you ebrahim operator our next question is from brock vandervliet with ubs please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning i think there was a lot of concern initially going back to the rent act and now certainly more focused with covid that lower building valuations especially in your core multifamily space would make it much more difficult for you to pencil out when loans came up for refinancing have you found valuations refinancing how have you found valuations holding in and can you talk about that thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so brock its tom good morning i would say that for the most part cap rates are still remaining significantly lower than i guess what was expected in the beginning of the year so rates are still holding in on the capitalization side values are obviously being subject to some regional decline so obviously when we look at our peak to trough and we look at cecl moderate downside scenarios were running apartment houses down close to office down retail down so were really looking at the impact of the cash flows and whats most important when were actually receiving the cash flows from the customers as we work out these ones that are on deferrals that coming off deferral theyre able to pay their bills which is telling that theyre cash flow positive and in the event were going to refinance them at cash flow positive well be able to well be able to do that with no real issue doesnt mean that everyone is going to be cash flow positive but the result that we see here to get to that high bar of standard of additional relief request for the most part most customers are able to be able to do their debt service coverage ratio adequately it may not be at maybe theyre at or but the reality is the money is coming through we gave them six months of balance sheet relief and now they have excess cash flow and they new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 were very thankful for that because obviously it helped them out to work with their own customers on the ground floor especially on the commercial side so id say that has been no question obvious reason an adjustment in the marketplace but given the low ltv that the company has we have a ltv in queens a original ltv in manhattan these are low ltvs so in the event that they come back to the bank and which they will because obviously theyre relatively shortterm assets were very comfortable on refinancing them and you can see by the origination flow weve been doing that our overall retention rate has been spot on all year north of the goal was to keep it at to shoot for that net loan growth number for the year this is coming from our own portfolio we believe that that may improve as we get into the fourth quarter because obviously were seeing a lot of these customers coming to us in particular we have about billion that are up for renewal this quarter which is our own portfolio and we believe that all of these loans will have the ability to be able to refinance within the portfolio so were very confident there brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and i heard your commentary on loan yields holding in around it seems to be somewhat at odds with the drumbeat of lower yields really across the sector in many different loan types how is that a factor of the competitive environment how why are you so successful in holding yields north of thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible id say on average if you look at where the fiveyear and the sevenyear indiscernible around slightly north on average we are going to do very well in competing obviously the agency is a major force here but the structure of an agency loan versus putting a portfolio loan has different nuances and were very competitive there so if we had to shave a quarter point an eighth of a point for a solid business well do so were not going to do high ltv were not looking if customers are going to get financing that doesnt make sense to the bank especially in the midst of a pandemic well let the assets leave the bank but the retention rate has been hitting our bogey which is fabulous we believe that will improve in the fourth quarter in particular and we feel highly confident that all in we can average around loan coupons which when you run that through our model it bodes well for margin expansion in a very low interest rate environment where i think theres a disconnect on the funding side is that bank shortterm bank deposits are probably priced too high in the marketplace the good news is that we are seeing some of the nontraditional institutions lower their rates to more inclined to the market rates where overall treasuries are trading plus the spread brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc on the funding side yeah new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 operator and our next question is from steve moss with b riley securities please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve joseph r ficalora a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning stephen m moss q analyst b riley fbr inc good morning just following up on the borrowings here just wondering what is the ability to restructure any borrowings either in the fourth quarter and the upcoming year thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so steve id say that obviously its always that opportunity that we look at it obviously is across the capital for that so we would evaluate that depending on profitability depending on forward curve analysis we do have approximately billion at coming due next year so that so the pain on that to restructure is probably not significant because its due in one year but we evaluate that from time to time in the event that we have lets say sizable economic benefits in a given quarter we will always look to monetize that opportunity on a core basis going forward to try to enhance future earnings going forward but clearly the stuff in the back end is expensive we have some expensive borrowings going out to with around indiscernible 003248on that and i think that will be a much more painful as far as cost of capital and the earn back so we do evaluate earn back it has to make logical sense to take that charge and we evaluate that on a quarterly basis stephen m moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay appreciate that and tom just thinking about loan growth here what on the specialty finance portfolio good growth quarter over quarter kind of wondering what your expectations are for the upcoming fourth quarter and into thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc id say for special finance we really expected that rebound in q3 given the decline in q2 from literally being in the epicenter of the pandemic that was a nationwide drop in general so we had the recovery there on the auto side which is a significant portion of our business its booming right now so theres a shortage of inventory we see a lot of god drawdowns right now so we have a nice uncommitted committed line of approximately billion of outstanding or billion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 it wouldnt be surprising to see more lines being drawn down and at the end of the year ph so many economic recovery continues so i would say that they will continue to grow were very optimistic of that group the credit is pristine we have zero loans on deferral we dont anticipate we anticipate zero losses in that business and its performing beautifully so were very supportive of the business remember this does not come with funding so were a credit buy up shop and we choose what we want to finance as far as the customer book that we have right now we have pay and we have a great portfolio that should just grow from the fact that we have a substantial commitment line but we also anticipate to be active in the market to grow it at levels that are consistent which are very high cagr so i would say its going to be hopefully continued growth that with the multifamily cre right now has been relatively flat to slightly down as the marketplace given the lack of property transactions and deals happening in the new york city marketplace and that could change eventually as the economy recovers on the real estate side but multifamily has clearly going to be the drive along with specialty financing in the future for the company stephen m moss q analyst b riley fbr inc okay appreciate that if i could sneak one last one in here i think the press release said million in branch reopenings and covid expenses just kind of curious how you think about expenses on the for the fourth quarter thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so look we were probably a little bit off in q3 we had the conversion we had some additional expenses there the ppe cost as well as testing for employees and the reopening for both the headquarters the multiple operations that we operate as well as the branches theres a lot of testing involved so there is expenses to get reopened and that number obviously went into the third quarter i would say well probably going to be around that 130million level by year end so maybe up a couple million about year end so for the year well probably stay about million for which was significantly lower than our original projection going back to last year at million wed like to see it lower but obviously we never anticipated the pandemic and theres costs associated with that pandemic not material cost but clearly we saw a little bit of an uptick in q3 and were probably going to see around 130million level in q4 stephen m moss q analyst b riley fbr inc all right thank you very much thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator and our next question is from ken zerbe with morgan stanley please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 good morning ken kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc good morning tom tom you guys mentioned that your loan yields i think were either around or maybe over the fiveyear treasury but your average more average loan yields on your portfolio currently around million is that basis points the right amount of asset yield compression that we should expect over time thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well ken i would just you got to back up prepay right so we reported million but i mean back up prepay is like million so thats where we are as of the end of the quarter approximately and then when you think about whats coming due its about a 340million to million thats coming due in the fourth quarter on billion next year its million so yes its lower than the market yields but the pain is not as bad as it was a few years ago so i think its manageable given the deposit costs and the borrowing costs coming down materially from there and given the re pricing offcycles were still liability sensitive so yeah so i think that were getting around the low on average and i will say a 300basis point spread this is certainly depending on the deal depending on the duration 10year versus or io versus nonio its all reflected to the market competition is fierce with the agency but we compete and we stand by our solid customers on the asset quality side at the same time id also want to make a very important statement during this whole journey of pandemic dealing with covid19 when we worked with these deferrals we were very focused on making sure to ensure we have the customers paying their escrow accounts making sure that we have the operating accounts now in control so in the event they come back for potentially a second round deferral we really understand the behavior pattern of that building because we have the cash flow its no longer housed at jpmorgan its housed here and thats very important when we entered into these deferral agreements so the fact that we have the ability to be a little bit more flexible in rates for the positive relationship were enjoying a nice shift into lower cost funds as well which has been a cultural change for the bank historically weve always been about the asset ph starting the deposits flows came from acquisitions right kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it no no understood certainly and then with the reserves obviously i know your credit is really really good so theres no question about that but can you just talk about what the driver of the reserve build was this quarter i mean just given the zero ncos i would have expected a zero provision thomas robert a cangemi senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no look were in the midst of a pandemic we have a history of pretty much zero losses especially on the cre side so when you think about cre id say qualitatively and quantitatively we have a basis points quantitative new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 reserve versus a basis points qualitative reserve and when you add that up its based on our history its considered as a we would say over ph recharge because we have a history of no losses but we acknowledge the property price declines in particular our region which is the new york city region so well probably reallocate a little bit more towards the commercial real estate space probably into the office books and also into the retail book but ill tell you this given the history and the actual results of the loans that have went back on full payment status youre probably more likely not going to see reversal if everyone is back on full payment status because we took into account rating shifts reevaluation of cash flows and the anticipation at certain degree these loans would be in a second round deferral but the fact that were seeing as of today for the first bucket in full payment status and that continues youre probably looking at an adjustment in the future that will be favorable for the bank because of indiscernible kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc and just one quick on expenses the million you gave for fourth quarter is there anything unusual in that or is that sort of the new base level that we should grow on as we think about thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc ill give the street some guidance when we come out in january but im not going to give guidance yet i mean we feel highly confident that the conversion is complete we have opportunity within the bank were going to look at that very carefully in the fourth quarter and obviously as you know historically the company has always been very efficient we beat our overall expectations in and so we budgeted million we came in at million the anticipated million assuming we hit million at the end of the quarter hopefully that number is conservative but our goal is to be very efficient given the magnitude of the carnage in the marketplace were going to be always belt tightening so well have some guidance for us you guys next quarter but clearly were very pleased to be at below million we like to be at million but clearly the pandemic had some expenses and the post and pushing with the conversion for a year had some consequences of expense and i think that we should get the benefit of that going forward since were all on one platform and lots of our systems now could be reevaluated for us to see where our potential expense savings will occur and thats a process that well go through the year end process and budget and forecast kenneth zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right thank you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator and our next question is from steven duong with rbc capital markets please proceed with your question new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys tom just your cet1 ratio it dipped a little bit this quarter can you just explain what was going on with that thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i mean well mostly growth right we were growing we continue to grow on a quarterly basis were very comfortable with our internal capital model our capital plans and again this is solely driven from growth i mean our earnings are going higher which is great the forecast is for the year at eps growth from versus were on target for that so were very pleased with the growth trajectory of the capital build now so thats positive towards overall capital as we are growing steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay and then just on your office exposure do you have the exposure by the different boroughs thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc say manhattan thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so look i think manhattan is the area that were spending a lot of time on reevaluating these credits and cash flow and ratings reevaluation and ill tell you that if you break it down ill go back to the categories mixed use we had over million going back to the previous quarter were now down to million in mixed use in mixed use commercial in manhattan the retail is phenomenal at pay were down to million in retail in manhattan which is much better than we anticipated given the pandemic office right now is probably the high bar where we have a total deferral of million right now were at million thats in manhattan were going to work hard in the next few weeks to see how this all plays out but that is the area that has the highest percentage and the dollar amount thats on deferral multifamily as of the end of the quarter actually end of october which is the update we gave in the investor deck is million thats in manhattan so thats blended across the five boroughs in multifamily the next borough will be brooklyn at about million for multifamily but clearly on the office side thats the area that i would reshift the energy level towards the deferral issue that we have to deal with new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it appreciate it if i could just ask one more thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc just on your office exposure what was your prepandemic coverage ratio thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so id say we anticipate i have bear with me one second here office we have about million just under million on debt service coverage ratio ltv at steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc perfect thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i used the example that we had in office very wealthy owners in office as an office building and it was due in october ltv was we had to make sure we get paid on this one we felt highly confident that this is a its flagship area flagship location in any event the building was going to go through difficulties we have people willing to work it out with the customer and we sell the note at par so these are real coveted asset classes this is family wealth over many years some of them at exchanges that has created longterm wealth for property owners and then im just going to walk away so the fact that we gave them six months relief thats a lot of balance sheet relief six months cash flow on a large credit and this is a fairly large credit and we ended up getting paid which is great and thats our approach our approach is at the bar going into the second round deferral if any is very high we go through a very rigorous program that the cash flow analysis has to be presented and we feel they have the ability to pay were not going to give out relief when its not justified steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right and so you prepandemic you were at million and your minimum is million is that correct thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah on the commercial side thats correct new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great appreciate the color guys thank you thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure operator and our next question is from matthew breese with stephens incorporated please proceed with your question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc good morning matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey just touch on the expenses the uptick in ga how much of that due to the systems conversion and is therefore permanent versus covid and subject to fluctuation thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc id say its probably evenly split from the uptick i think i guided it was indiscernible couple of million bucks id say million ahead for the conversion the rest was ppe and testing remember we have a lot more people going back to the various locations and there is an expense thats associated with that dealing with getting the branches up and running so all the branches for the most part are up and running for the time being depending on the pandemic but clearly with some expense there so id say its split between conversion and ppe matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then i interrupted you im sorry thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so in testing as well there is an expense to that we dont have doctors on staff so we have to do hire people to ensure the safety for our employees matthew breese q analyst stephens inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 got it and then could you just update us on the strategy around securities where do you want it to be what are new yields and what kind of investments are you looking at there thomas robert a cangemi senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc so in my guide up double digits for the quarter i anticipate the security yields to come down so our guide for the quarter is up again once again double digits so assuming basis points up in fourth quarter which is reasonable based on our modeling we are assuming the current yields are coming down on securities i wouldnt be surprised well see another good significant drop in security so far were looking at somewhere in the million to million type level in the fourth quarter and were being very cautious given the marketplace so our securities portfolio as a percentage of assets is probably its been pretty much at the lowest level indiscernible i think its like is that right john yeah which is about a 52billion book on a 54billion balance sheet low so obviously we dont want to jump into the securities market with significant investment now given that we have reasonable loan demand and we want to be very cautious given where yields are so its a wait and see moment and we cant control interest rates so we think that yields in general are going to be relatively low youre looking at reinvestment yields probably in the low and its not the opportune time to grow that portfolio we may from timetotime put on additional liquidity thatll be a business decision that we decide as how we manage our outgo process but clearly its not an opportune time to grow the book matthew breese q analyst stephens inc understood okay and then i know you guys feel very comfortable in the deferral front thomas robert a cangemi senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah very matthew breese q analyst stephens inc just curious what happened quarteroverquarter to criticize and classified assets over the balances this quarter versus last and have you seen any risk rating migration thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah id say special mention went up a little bit because obviously when you go through this analysis and before you even get as much information you can from the borrowers that are going through the pandemic we focused new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 solely on the portfolio that was in deferrals weve done a lot of work on that for regulatory reasons thats what we should be doing and we shifted a lot of these loans to the special mention matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc again the good news is that as they continue to pay they go back to full payment status and their cash flow in north of levels that we didnt expect were going to roll them at a special mention and thatll be the next phase of the benefit of that so we will we do it as an abundance of caution and conservatism as we should matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and then the last one is just you mentioned cap rates are holding up better than one might have expected thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah matthew breese q analyst stephens inc could you just frame that a little bit better for us where multifamily office retail cap rate is today versus a year ago thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc id say consistent i dont see any movement at all i mean we were initially our view initially was when the rent regulatory changes came in last year that we had a 30basis point to 75basis point adjustment depending on the borough and we write a much higher cap rate in the bronx than we do in the bronx versus manhattan so manhattan cap rates were always lower in general so have a much lower ltv were as an abundance of caution but they havent moved a whole lot so youre still in the low to mid depending on rent regulatory versus non rent regulatory id say for when you look at some of the deals that were done in the past to months when since the change in rent laws id say a handle on a rent regulated building is not unusual but when you throw in commercial use space and other revenue streams you start getting into that mid so its been consistent so we do a deep dive every twice a year on rent regulatory stress testing and what we find when we statistically look at the whats going on in the marketplace the cap rates were going lower well we conservatively analyze it with an uptick and to stress the portfolio but surprisingly its been resilient matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great thats all i had and thanks for taking my questions new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 thomas robert a cangemi senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc welcome operator and our next question is from christopher marinac with fig partners please proceed with your question christopher marinac q analyst fig partners hey thanks tom and joe you mentioned earlier about the very strong credit quality on the specialty finance it looks like maybe or more is pass rated so do you have to allocate the reserve at a higher level just given the pandemic or would you still kind of look at the reserve allocation similar to prior quarters thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible senior secured credits even when a credit goes to difficulties were secure by inventory equipment so again were very comfortable that this portfolio has zero loss content christopher marinac q analyst fig partners great tom thanks very much for all information this morning thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc you bet chris operator and our next question is from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america securities please proceed with your questions thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc hey ebrahim youre back ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah just two quick follow up questions one on the loantodeposit ratio how high do you see that running given just the attractiveness of the debt markets if you can touch upon that tom thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 so i would say that historically the company had a loantodeposit ratio as high as so were not there weve had some improvement its been a long time since the bank has executed on an ma transaction and obviously our historical growth in deposit has been driven through ma so the goal here in the long run is that eventually as we continue to focus on our business model which includes know putting businesses together and getting that funding side shored up on through consolidation thats always a possibility but absent that i think youre going to see probably well call it nominal deposit growth and well still choose based on whats best for the shareholders as far as cost of deposits and duration and right now the wholesale markets are very attractive theyre more attractive than whats offered out there and well call on the hot money cd market clearly you can put on fiveyear money lower than you could on the cd markets if you go short youre looking at between basis points to basis points type cost of funds depending on your duration risk that you want to take so there is theres this business decision you have to make when it comes to repricing your deposits aggressively for growth and again our growth is manageable its reasonable when im targeting type loan growth and asset growth were still shooting for that net loan growth number driven by multifamily and specialty especially finance indiscernible by the cre reduction so i think with a reasonable growth in our internal deposit analysis we can grow between a small portion of that on deposit growth as well as repricing the funds lower aggressively and benefit from a unique opportunity on the wholesale side which is cheaper than retail in this current environment with the proviso that in the event that were fortunate to be able to put something together on the acquisition side or business combination side thats where this model can change dramatically to have a different funding mechanism ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and while i have you just in the remaining 3billion deferred book there is no reason to believe why you think the experience because there could be some pushback around there is a higher risk loans in that portfolio when we think about the remaining thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc deferrals is there any reason to believe why they would behave differently than what youve seen so far thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc look i would say that these are the ones that filed for the deferral later right its one month later ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc right yes new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc the other ones that waited days to come back to what the bank offered so we were all over these customers we understand the dynamic of it were very optimistic that this will continue and i broke out the area of risk i think weve shifted it more towards the office versus retail and mixed use which is a good thing and well deal with that as it goes along but these office credits are the average ltv that we originally indiscernible as so its better than the retail and id say not as obviously mixed use with the lowest ltv but its better than the retail and the retail surprisingly did outperform at million thats sitting in manhattan right now we feel pretty good about that the retail customers have stepped up in payment status and the fact that we can reshift our effort now that office is the potential risk here the ltvs of all the customers are very strong these are large property owners and we focus on conservative underwriting and the debt service coverage ratios when generated works ordinarily high ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc well thank you operator and our next question is from collyn gilbert with kbw please proceed with your question thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc collyn good morning collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good morning good morning tom good morning joe tom i just want to make sure i understand so on the expense side and youve given obviously good color but so the elevation that youre going to expect in the fourth quarter and obviously what we saw in this quarter attributable to the conversion cost as well as covid cost without specifics so generally do i mean are there should those expenses be coming down next year or there are other investments youre going to need to make indiscernible thomas robert cangemi a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc no i think yeah id say the investments were made on a conversion we spent a lot of time effort and energy over years to get this conversion done it was the largest conversion the bank ever went through indiscernible it was a partnership we collaborated together we worked together as what the bank needs were and we adjusted the top offering and we worked with them over the past multiple years so we feel most of that expense has been absorbed going forward were going to have im not going to give guidance yet but again were an efficient company we want to get that efficiency ratio down to that was the goal for we think well hit by the end of the year and were also driving profitability up so if you look at where our eps cagr was versus we should be up around eps growth with significant margin expansion i think when i first gave my new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 margin guide people felt that i was way too aggressive at being a margin i said we came off of a low was it john in margin so we felt between somewhat basis point is reasonable so here we are coming into the fourth quarter i gave the guide for bps going into q4 it gets you to that number and hopefully im conservative and i think it all depends on what happens next year with cost of funds going forward and where the shape of the curve is so the good news is that the spreads are healthy that we have healthy spreads in our business model is it ph bps or bps its not bps like it was going into the financial crisis and i think the competition has waned a little bit i see people a little bit nervous to do lending in new york and were open for business in new york were going to be there for our customers in these uncertain times and these are cash flowing assets and the collections are high and were very comfortable on working with these historical good property owners that have been doing business with us in good times and bad times collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great everything else is covered
