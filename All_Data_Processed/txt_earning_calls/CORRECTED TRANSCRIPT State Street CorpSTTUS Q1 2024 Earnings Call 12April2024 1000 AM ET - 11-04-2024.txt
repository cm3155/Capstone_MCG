officer director state street corp thank you ilene and good morning everyone earlier today we released our first quarter financial results we had a strong start to the year with our results demonstrating the breadth of our client franchise the efficacy of our strategy and our focus on execution we reported both fee and total revenue growth all while continuing to invest meaningfully in our business and controlling underlying expenses excluding notable items we delivered both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as solid eps growth in q1 relative to the year ago period the first quarter was an important milestone we have detailed our strategic priorities for including the growth initiatives we are undertaking across each of our business areas as we continue to both invest in our capabilities and also target further productivity gains guided by our purpose to help create better outcomes for the worlds investors and the people they serve our four strategic priorities are aimed at continuing to extend our competitive advantage while delivering positive fee operating leverage excluding notable items in these priorities are growing fee revenue extending our leadership in our markets in financing and global advisers franchises enhancing and optimizing our operating model and continuing to differentiate our business through innovative client solutions and technologyled capabilities to support business growth we remain intensely focused on executing against these strategic priorities particularly in a dynamic operating environment in which financial market expectations continue to change significantly for example as inflation remains elevated and economic data continued to be robust investors push back their expectation for the timing of central bank rate cuts and treasury yields increased during the first quarter despite this global equity markets performed strongly and volatility remained muted with many indices setting records as fears of a hard economic landing receded and optimism surrounding the potential economic benefit from artificial intelligence continued in q1 turning to side of our investor presentation i will review our first quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail beginning with our financial performance started strongly yearover year we produced both positive fee and total operating leverage as well as good eps growth excluding notable items first quarter eps was or excluding a notable item related to the increase to the fdic special assessment underlying yearoveryear eps growth was supported by total fee revenue growth and continued common share repurchases which more than offset the impact of lower nii on total revenue state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 underlying expenses continue to be wellcontrolled supported by our ongoing productivity efforts with first quarter expenses increasing just yearoveryear excluding notable items even as we have increased the level of investments in our business turning to our business momentum which you can see in the middle of the slide we continue to make progress across our client franchise and generating better fee revenue growth within asset services auca increased to a record trillion we generated asset servicing auca wins of billion in q1 supported by key wins in both north america and europe servicing fee revenue wins totaled million after hitting our full year sales target of million in we remain confident in our ability to achieve our increased servicing fee revenue sales goal of million to million in our priority to grow fee revenue this year is underpinned by a strategy of leading with service excellence and driving stronger backoffice sales differentiating with our state street alpha and private markets platforms our two new alpha mandate wins this quarter demonstrate our ability to execute on this strategy while also showcasing the clear competitive advantage and differentiation that alpha creates for our business for example both alpha mandate wins this quarter include backoffice services which can install quickly allowing us to realize revenue faster further one mandate is our second alpha for private markets win a key growth area for us encouragingly both of these alpha wins were takeaways from a key competitor with one of the wins having no existing services with state street prior to becoming an alpha client and the other a shared client that will now consolidate back office with state street within markets and financing even as low fx volatility created a headwind for the industry in the first quarter we attracted higher fx client volumes both sequentially and yearoveryear supported by our marketleading and wideranging fx trading solutions in fx we are pleased to see higher client volumes in the qoverq fee revenue growth we also expanded our markets franchise within outsourced trading we continue to expand our product capabilities and geographical reach completing the acquisition of cf global trading in q1 global advisors performed well buoyed by higher equity markets the strategic actions we have taken to position our asset management business for growth and the benefits of the strong finish and stepoff point at yearend management fees of million are the highest since the first quarter of while ga experienced total aggregate outflows in q1 this was driven by the impact of a large but expected single client redemption within the institutional business we saw continued momentum in the defined contribution business driven by our target date franchise encouragingly we saw cash net inflows of billion in the quarter the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net inflows of our cash business etf aum reached a record trillion at quarter end with ga continuing to gather net inflows and expand market share within us lowcost etfs now let me spend a moment on our continuing productivity efforts we have a detailed set of initiatives across our business aimed at creating cost efficiencies and lasting productivity improvements regarding our ongoing operating model transformation which forms an important part of these productivity initiatives as you know we are streamlining our operating model in india and last quarter we consolidated our first operations joint venture in the country i am pleased to note that the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in india closed on april combined these two consolidations will propel the continued endtoend transformation of our global operations and enable state street to unlock productivity savings in the years ahead as we simplify our operating model state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 before i conclude my opening remarks i would like to touch on our continuing balance sheet strength total capital return amounted to million in the first quarter consisting of common share dividends and share repurchases i would highlight that we have returned a substantial amount of capital to our shareholders in recent quarters with total capital return over the last six quarters equivalent to almost of state streets total market cap at quarter end as we pivot to a more normalized level of capital return this year as we have outlined previously it remains our intention to return approximately of earnings in in the form of common share dividends and share repurchases subject to market conditions and other factors to conclude we have delivered a strong start to the year as demonstrated by both sequential and yearoveryear total fee revenue growth encouraging business wins strong underlying expense discipline and continued capital return as we look ahead we remain highly focused on the execution of a set of clear strategic priorities for these strategic priorities are backed by detailed action plans aimed to driving growth across each of our business areas underpinning this execution is a set of business investments paired with a comprehensive set of productivity initiatives aimed at driving longerterm improvements in our operating model efficiency and effectiveness and generating positive fee operating leverage in now let me hand the call over to eric who will take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone turning to slide ill begin my review of our first quarter financial results which included a eps impact from an additional fdic special assessment as described within the notable items table on the right of the slide as ron noted we produced a strong start to the year on the left panel you can see that total fee revenue was up both sequentially and yearonyear relative to the year ago period we delivered robust management fee growth higher front office software and data revenue and servicing fee growth while underlying expenses were well controlled as i mentioned during the first quarter we recorded a provision for credit losses of million largely due to two cre names all told we generated both positive total and fee operating leverage relative to the year ago excluding notable items we also delivered solid yearonyear eps growth of excluding notable items which was supported by the continuation of our share buybacks in the first quarter turning now to slide we saw periodend auca increased by on a yearonyear basis and sequentially to a record level yearonyear the increase in auca was largely driven by higher period end market levels net new business and client flows i would note that we have seen a mix shift into cash and cash equivalents worth an estimated to percentage points of total auca versus a year ago quarteronquarter auca increased primarily due to higher period end market levels and client flows global advisors period end aum also increased to a record level up yearonyear largely reflecting higher period end market levels and net inflows and up sequentially primarily due to higher period end market levels at the state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 right center of the slide the market volatility indices provide a useful indicator of client transactional activity that drives servicing fees spreads in fx trading and special activity in agency lending turning to slide on the left side of the page youll see first quarter total servicing fees up yearonyear primarily from higher average market levels partially offset by pricing headwinds a previously disclosed client transition and lower client activity and adjustments including changes in certain client asset mix into lower earning cash and cash equivalents in addition the pace of installation started slower than we expected in the first quarter let me dimension some of these items for you as ive told you before the impact of the previously disclosed client transition was a headwind of approximately percentage points to yearonyear growth in addition lower client activity and adjustments including the client asset mix shift to cash was also a headwind of approximately percentage points of yearonyear growth this quarter some of which we believe is cyclical sequentially total servicing fees were up primarily as a result of higher average market levels partially offset by lower client activity and adjustments including the changes to certain asset mix and pricing headwinds on the bottom of the slide we summarized some of the key performance indicators of our servicing business in the first quarter we generated million of servicing fee wins nicely spread across both north america and europe as you recall solid sales in north america like this was one of the goals that we had described at a conference last fall in addition we had million of servicing fee revenue to be installed at quarter end up million yearonyear and million quarteronquarter we also had trillion of auca to be installed at period end turning now to slide first quarter management fees were up yearonyear primarily reflecting higher average market level and net inflows from the prior period partially offset by the impact of a strategic etf product suite repricing initiative relative to the prior quarter management fees were up due to similar reasons partially offset by lower performance fees as you can see on the bottomright of the slide following record inflows in our investment management franchise remains well positioned with momentum across each of its businesses in etfs the overall flows were relatively flat in first quarter our spdr portfolio us lowcost suite achieved continued market share gains driven by net inflows of billion in our institutional business we saw first quarter net outflows of billion primarily driven by a single client that said we saw continued momentum in the us defined contribution area with record aum of approximately billion lastly in our cash franchise we saw first quarter net inflows of billion the fourth consecutive quarter of positive net flows into cash turning now to slide first quarter fx trading services revenue was down yearonyear but up sequentially relative to the year ago period the decrease was mainly due to lower spreads associated with the subdued fx volatility partially offset by higher volumes as client engagement increased across nearly all of our fx venues quarteronquarter the revenue increase primarily reflects higher volumes with particular strength in our em business as well as higher direct fx spreads first quarter securities finance revenues were down yearonyear mainly due to lower agency balances and lower spreads primarily associated with significantly lower industry specials activity on a quarteronquarter basis we have seen agency lending balances up as demand is rising state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 software and processing fees were up yearonyear in q1 largely driven by higher revenues associated with crd which ill discuss in more detail shortly quarteronquarter software and processing fees declined primarily due to our lower onpremise renewals partially offset by higher lendingrelated fees finally other fee revenue for the quarter increased million yearonyear sequentially other fee revenue increased million largely driven by an episodic currency devaluation in the prior quarter which did not recur moving to slide youll see on the left panel that first quarter front office software and data revenue increased yearonyear primarily as a result of continued saas implementations and conversions driving higher professional services and softwareenabled revenue growth sequentially front office software and data revenue was down primarily driven by lower onpremise renewals and installations turning to some of the alpha business metrics on the right panel we were pleased to report two additional alpha wins including our second alpha for private markets mandate in addition three mandates went live in the first quarter bringing the total number of live mandates to first quarter arr increased yearonyear driven by over saas client implementations and conversions over the last year turning to slide first quarter nii decreased yearonyear but increased sequentially to million the yearonyear decrease was largely due to deposit mix shift and lower average noninterestbearing deposit balances partially offset by the impact of higher average interest rates client lending growth and investment portfolio positions we were pleased to report a sequential increase in nii which was primarily driven by higher investment securities yields an increase in average interestbearing deposits and loan growth partially offset by the decline in average noninterestbearing deposits the nii results on a sequential quarter basis were better than we had previously expected primarily driven by strength in both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposit balances towards the end of the quarter while it is difficult to forecast the path of deposits in the current environment were pleased with the success that we are having in engaging our clients on the right of this slide we provide highlights from our average balance sheet during the first quarter average deposits increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter mainly driven by client balance growth across the interestbearing deposit stack partially offset by a reduction in noninterestbearing deposits average noninterestbearing deposits decreased by less than billion quarteronquarter cumulative us dollar client deposit betas were since the start of the current rate cycle with cumulative foreign currency basis for the same period continuing to be lower in the to range depending on currency turning to slide first quarter expenses excluding notable items increased barely yearonyear as we both invested more to fuel fee growth and increase the size of our productivity and optimization savings efforts by more than on a linebyline basis excluding notable items on a yearonyear basis compensation and employee benefits decreased primarily driven by lower incentive compensation and salaries as well as a decline in contractor spend that was partially driven by the consolidation of one of our operations joint ventures in india information systems and communications expenses increased mainly due to higher technology and infrastructure investments partially offset by the optimization savings and vendor savings initiatives transaction state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 processing increased mainly reflecting higher broker fees due to increased global market volumes occupancy increased partially due to real estate costs associated with the consolidation of the joint venture in india which used to form part of the contracted cost within compensation benefits partially offset by footprint optimization and other expenses increased largely due to timing of foundation funding lastly ill spend a moment on our transformation efforts if you recall consolidating the first operations joint venture last october increased our fte head count as we insource those capabilities however it also came with an expected financial benefit excluding integration costs of million over the course of the year as ron mentioned the consolidation of our second operations joint venture in india closed on april 1st and this will also come with an increase in additional head count from as well as expected financial benefits the consolidation of these two joint ventures will be a catalyst for the next phase of state streets global operations transformation and enable us to create a second wave of service improvements and productivity savings next year moving to slide on the left side of the slide we detail the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right of the slide as you can see our capital levels remain well above the regulatory minimums while we continue to focus on optimizing our capital stack the strength of our capital position enables us to extend our balance sheet to support our clients as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of was down approximately basis points quarteron quarter largely driven by the expected normalization of rwa the lcr for state street corporation was a healthy and of state street bank and trust our exceptionally strong liquidity metrics benefit from the deep and diversified nature of our funding base and active balance sheet management in the quarter we were pleased to return million to shareholders consisting of million of common share repurchases and million in declared common stock dividends as ron noted we continue to expect to return around of earnings to shareholders this year in summary were quite pleased with the quarter we have a clear strategy for growth a detailed set of priorities that we are executing against in order to drive continued positive business momentum and expect to deliver increased fee operating leverage this year excluding notable items finally let me cover our full year and second quarter outlook which i would highlight continues to have the potential for variability given the macro environment were operating in in terms of our current assumptions as we stand here today we are assuming global equity markets flat to first quarter end for the remainder of the year which implies daily averages up quarteronquarter in and up around for the full year our rate outlook broadly aligns with the current forward curve which i would note continues to move while we expect fx market volatility will remain muted given our strong start to the year and higher average market levels we think total fee revenue for the full year will now be at the higher end of our prior guide of up to yearonyear so up a solid which is better than our previous outlook there are however episodic industry headwinds impacting our servicing business this year including a previously disclosed client transition and the impact of client activity and adjustments which includes the client asset mix shift into lowerearning cash and cash equivalents we believe some of these factors are cyclical in nature and we expect to offset a portion with higher sales and additional management actions this year state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 turning to nii as a result of our first quarter outperformance strong deposit growth and the improved interest rate outlook we now expect full year nii will be down approximately yearonyear which is better than our previous guide of down approximately on expenses we expect full year expenses ex notables will be roughly in line with our prior guide of up about but with the potential for some additional revenuerelated costs this year given our improved outlook we now expect to deliver additional positive fee operating leverage for the full year excluding notable items finally turning to on a quarteronquarter basis and excluding notable items we would expect total fee revenue to be up to nii to be down to down and expenses up about to excluding the seasonal compensation expenses in and notable items we think the provisions for credit losses could be in the million to million range in and we would expect to have a better view on that later in the quarter as we continue to monitor our portfolio lastly we expect tax rate to be approximately and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer director state street corp operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and your first question will be from brennan hawken at ubs please go ahead brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions eric your updated guide sort of suggests that nii you guys expect to pull back a little bit here from this strong result here in the first quarter but one of the things that i noticed was repo was particularly robust in the quarter could you give a little color around what drove that strength and how sustainable it is and is some of that normalization embedded in your outlook thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp brennan its eric there are a number of factors that drove the upswing in nii into the first quarter the bulk of that was actually deposit balances coming in stronger than we had expected both on the interestbearing side across the stack and noninterestbearing as well that made up for the million uptick in terms of our results relative to our expectation the repo balances did tick up as well they were a small part but worth in nii terms about a percentage point of more nii than we had expected and i think what were seeing is that as the conditions in the economy continue to evolve clients are holding more cash on their balance sheets theyre then putting that into a variety of different instruments sometimes its on deposits sometimes its on sweeps and sometimes its in repo and thats also been particularly into the repo side have been aided a bit by the reduction in the feds overnight repo operations state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 so its really a mix of factors that were seeing which together though are driving a better nii performance which were pleased with brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yes great thank you you also quantified the impact of the blackrock transition so thanks for that it does seem as though maybe that impact is a little larger than your prior expectation do i have the right read on that and maybe could you give us an update on where we stand as far as the ongoing impact goes eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure brennan its eric again the previously announced client transition that we had referenced is in line in terms of amounts that we had expected if you recall we had said it would be worth about percentage points of servicing fees this year which is about percentage point of total fees and remember if you go back to our original disclosure over the last couple of years we had described the total amount to be worth about percentage points of total fees and were seeing about half of that come through on a yearonyear basis this quarter and for this year and so fully in line with what we had previously described brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp sure operator thank you next question will be from glenn schorr at evercore please go ahead glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hello there one quickie followup on the nii stuff and thank you for all the details the balance is coming into march i know these things are really hard to predict but is something happening with the client discussions and the overall profitability management that might give you confidence that those balances stick or should we think of this as rates are higher parking balances with a safe custodian eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp glenn weve been heavily engaged with our clients over the last year id say year and a half as weve seen quite a shift in the interest rate environment and the evolution of deposits in the banking system id answer your question at a couple of different levels i think first going into this year we had expected total client deposit balances in the billion to billion and we now see that in the million to billion for this quarter and to be honest we expect that we continue at around that level and a lot of that is both the engagement that weve had with clients they all have cash and we certainly encourage them to bring it to us state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 and part of that is the way we think about client relationships client profitability the client services that we can offer and so i think some of what youre seeing here in the higher aggregate levels of deposits is due to our management action i think in addition to that there do tend to be somewhat higher deposits in the banking system so the tide has been gently rising id say very gently and thats been helpful and we expect that to be relatively neutral going forward but well obviously need to see based on the various actions at the fed and how they evolve glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi very cool appreciate that one quickie you cant comment on the specifics but im more talking the big picture you were named in some stories as potential interest in some private credit manager im more talking big picture of where theoretically that might fit in and just i like the better flows ph on cns ssga but strategically what are you focused on in terms of continuing growth across that franchise ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yeah glenn its ron so weve tried to be quite clear about what were doing over at ssga i mean first is around continuing to grow the etf franchise as you know our legacy strength is in the institutional business where we continue to be quite strong and weve focused a lot over the last several years on growing the lowcost etf franchise which tends to find its way into retail portfolios through intermediaries that led to the repricing initiative that we did last year which in retrospect has proven to be quite a smart move because the market share has gone up and those portfolios tend to move these are buyandhold investors so etfs would be one and we continue to grow the active space typically working with very close partners of ours and we see a lot of runway in active and then finally fixed income particularly out we have a strong fixed income offering here in the us and weve built it out quite a bit in the last couple of years in europe and youre seeing lots of strength in the etf ecosystem in europe second area of growth is really trying to leverage the institutional client base because its legacy is the passive index business if we have an institutional relationship we tend to be the number one or number two manager on their platform that gives you a seat at the table and we believe it gives us an ability to potentially distribute other kinds of products and services so thats where a lot of our focus is now on the institutional business and then finally continuing to deepen we have a global franchise but theres areas that we can deepen it more youve heard us talk about europe and were focused just as much on asia pacific as those markets continue to grow and were able to leverage the positions we have but really focusing on deepening as opposed to broadening geographic reach so that in a nutshell is how were thinking about it and were pleased with how its playing out glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i appreciate that ron thanks operator thank you next question will be from ken usdin at jefferies please go ahead please go ahead ken your line is open could you please unmute state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 no response moving on to alex blostein at goldman sachs please go ahead alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hi good morning everybody thanks another one for nii i guess good quarter good guide for the second quarter as well and thats sort of elevating your full year nii guidance also but similarly i guess to kind of what we saw in your guidance last quarter the back half of the year seems to have a pretty meaningful dropoff for the tune of maybe million or so versus the quarterly run rate eric i guess given your comments on deposits being stable and higher rates are where they are are you still getting the benefit of repricing on the securities portfolio what informs this sort of decline in nii towards the back of the year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp alex its eric were going to continue to see some of the trends that we have been seeing and its just a matter of how the various pieces partially or fully offset each other over time were going to continue to see a tailwind from the level of rates at least given the current forward curve because that plays through the investment portfolio in play and gives us a tailwind as does some continued growth in lending the headwind that weve been navigating through which i would describe comes in steps and sometimes its a step down sometimes half a step back up is around the deposit levels across the interestbearing stack where were just seeing deposits i think at nice levels to be honest while we continue to see the grind down of noninterestbearing deposits and we do expect another quarter of that the noninterestbearing deposits to trend down and then to flatten out in the second half of the year so youll see those trends continue i think well see where we come out but if you take our guide together we expect a modest step down into the second quarter and then we see a leveling off in the third and fourth quarter of our nii i think in the past weve talked about being in a range of million to million a quarter were now seeing and expect to be comfortably above the million per quarter range but its those factors as headwinds and tailwinds that will play through that will kind of dictate exactly where we come out but i think as ive said earlier the level of client engagement that weve had in terms of putting deposits with us putting deposits at different price points with us some of those are the core transactional deposits that need to support custody accounts and some of those are the discretionary amounts of deposits has been a real priority for the franchise and i think one that weve shown some good success in and thats really creating i think this better expectation than we had earlier signaled at the beginning of the year and one that we think will endure and then provide the stability and over time upside in nii in the coming years alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great all right thats helpful my second question was around expenses you talked about how consolidation of the jv i guess that took place recently in april here will create a new wave of optimization for next year if i got that right can you just outline what that could mean in terms of incremental either regearing benefits or cost benefits however you want to frame that and what that means for maybe the overall kind of expense growth for the franchise i know youre holding the line this year really well but is there an opportunity to kind of continue that into as well thanks state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yes alex its ron here i think its good to focus on what we said here because weve talked to you and your colleagues just about ongoing productivity improvement weve been at it for years and we do believe this unlocks a potential not a potential but a new wave of productivity growth and why is that well firstly almost by definition if youre taking these ventures on youre eliminating the margin that was in it that was in our expenses that now comes out right so youve got that as a near immediate tailwind but more importantly and more important for the long term is that we can really complete and take advantage of true end toend process improvement and simplification we had created through the jvs which go back to the early days of our offshoring journey weve created a lot of complication unintentionally we created a lot of complication this enables us to get at that the work has already started our operations folks are spending a lot of time in india theyve done some recent hiring and brought on some great leadership there so if you think about the importance of india to our operations and the amount of work that passes through there between this endtoend simplification this ability to eliminate checkers of checkers of checkers and all those kinds of things we see an enormous amount of opportunity to improve and then finally as we continue our technology investment a lot of that will be directed there it will be directed at some of the things that in the past you would have said well lets take advantage of labor arbitrage and now the technology is at a cost level where we can simply eliminate the labor and not have particularly for some of these repetitive kinds of tasks between machine learning and other kinds of ai that you can use to replace labor and you end up then with a one a lower labor cost but more importantly youve got job content thats very attractive to people and people want to make careers here as opposed to feeling like theyre stuck in this dead end repetitive tasks so we are very optimistic about this alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks thanks so much operator thank you next question will be from brian bedell at deutsche bank please go ahead brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning thanks for taking my questions first just a confirmation on the guidance you gave eric on the fee revenue up to nii down to expenses up to is that sequential for revenue and yearoveryear for expenses eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp no it was sequential for every one of those as you look forward so it was all on a to basis brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc basis okay so then going back to the nii guide i think you also said down to versus the to in and then did you say down again in and then flattening out or flattening out in state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp what i described is a flatter second half of the year and so there are different paths here to be honest and it really will just depend on the level of deposits the level of interest rates just how the kind of the tail of some of the client deposit repricings that weve described come through towards the back end of those so i gave a highlevel view but brian i think theres a range of scenarios what we do have some confidence in is the expectation that in aggregate nii will be down from a full year basis and thats quite a bit better than the down that we had previously guided towards brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right yes and if i use the flattish assumption im more like flat for the year on that cadence but would that be sort of a as you said a range but a flat nii outcome yearoveryear would be at the better end of your range or is that sort of really difficult to achieve eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp no let me try to clarify we expect total nii to be down on a yearonyear basis for the full year what i did say is that we expect nii to be in and to be roughly the same to be flattish between those two quarters and so now the question is exactly how much does it come down in the second quarter and then from second quarter into the combination of third and fourth quarter how much does that come down and theres a range of different scenarios that i think you could foresee but the reason were trying not to overspec the exact quarter by quarter by quarter expectation is theres just underlying volatility out there in the kind of macroeconomic conditions in the riskon riskoff sentiment in the central banks actions right and then in our client deposit levels and so hopefully that gives you enough context to go on brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats super helpful and then maybe just on the private markets wins it sounds like momentum is improving there maybe if you could just talk about what your pipeline is looking like in private markets alpha and kind of your expectations over the next one to two years ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp hi brian its ron i mean weve talked about the private business as being a doubledigit growth business we stand by that we see lots of potential growth private markets alpha is developing nicely for us largely for many of the same reasons that alpha itself has its an opportunity as these firms become more complex operating and technology stacks thats a way to not just lower some costs but improve operations and future proof operations so its developing well so we remain optimistic about it brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thank you state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 operator thank you next question will be from david smith at autonomous research please go ahead david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning could you talk a little bit more about your capital priority today your payout ratio in the first quarter was somewhat below your full year target eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp david its eric we gave guidance at the beginning of the year on a full year basis purposely right because each quarter theres going to be a different set of variables as we navigate through so we described capital return in aggregate to be around total earnings for the year and we reaffirmed that in our prepared remarks if you then go into the specifics of the first quarter remember we had expected a normalization of the lower than usual rwa that came through in the fourth quarter some of that is just market factors playing through on the fx book some of that is equity markets upticking in the agency and the securities financing space and some of it to be honest is just putting capital to work with our clients where were engaging with them and thats driving some of the fee revenue growth that you saw at the same time our priority is to get capital back to shareholders we continued our dividend at pace as youd expect we had some buybacks this quarter if you do the math that buyback activity will increase going forward for the next few quarters we also had the new information about the fdic assessment and so we had to accrue for that expense instead of returning capital to shareholders for this particular quarter so anyway just a way to describe were on track with our priority and to be honest our commitment to get capital back to shareholders in line with earnings this year and it will just every quarter is a little bit different but i think youll see that accelerate into the second quarter david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you and i think you gave the tax rate for the second quarter are you still expecting to for the full year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think i need to quickly go back to the january remarks but we did not update those and so i think thats a good place a good estimate to use for the full year the one that you had back on the january call yeah thats correct david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay and just one last cleanup the preferred dividend theyll still be elevated in the million to million range in the second quarter but then it will be kind of more like million in the second half of the year eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 yeah yeah thats correct were just kind of moving through this past quarter one and quarter two between the redemptions the issuance and redemptions and then literally the tactical timing of some of the dividends youve got it right theres one more quarter of elevation in the million to million range next quarter meaning second quarter and then it will run at about million a quarter from third quarter onwards david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp thank you operator thank you next question will be from mike mayo at wells fargo please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp we can mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you talk about the relationship between stock markets and revenues you used to have for every change in the sp it impacts your servicing fees by x amount can you remind us what that is these days and how much of a lag there is with that and along with that i guess to your guidance for nii instead of being down to down what exactly changed the last kind of month or so eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp yeah mike its eric let me answer those in reverse order on nii what happened in the first quarter was really higher deposit balances across the interestbearing stock and even relative to our expectations on noninterest bearing in march so that changed in a positive way created an uplift into the first quarter that we had not expected the last time we gave full year guidance on nii was back in january when we expected it to be down on a full year basis for the full year and its only today that weve reassessed that we did not reassess that back at the beginning of march we reassessed that today and what were factoring in is the higher step off the higher level of deposits with us generally and the fewer rate cuts that were expecting from central banks around the world and so thats what gets us to a better full year guide on nii if i then turn to the equity market question how it factors through servicing fees we need to go through it in pieces and so let me start first what matters to us is not just the sp equity index because were global right more than of our revenues are abroad including in emerging markets and while the sp is up yearonyear the allworld index is up only and thats whats more material to our financial statements given the international and global footprint that we have state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 with that wed expect a substantial tailwind of servicing fees on a yearonyear basis in the up to range typically but it tends to move around as you said sometimes theres a bit of timing there sometimes theres a bit of mix there and so forth what we did see that was a headwind to that this year were two things one was the previously announced client transition and that was worth about two points of servicing fee headwinds and then weve continued to see a lower or ill describe different level of client activity that was worth almost percentage points of headwind this year some of which we think is cyclical some of that is transactional activity that weve talked about that we tend to get paid for on a unit basis through our fee schedules and then this quarter we also referenced the shift to client cash and cash equivalents within the auca stack which tends to come in at a much lower fee rate for custody and accounting services and so those were the pieces that went against us mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and just one followup just you said morethanexpected deposits why was that eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp i think the morethanexpected deposits is really driven by two factors one is that there tends to be more cash in the system in the banking system today we think thats a mix of central bank actions in particular in the us the reduction in the overnight repo operation that the fed is running that comes back in a way into our clients or into the banking system and thats been a i think thats generally improved liquidity conditions or added to what is our very liquid conditions have made them even more liquid and then the second factor to be honest is over the last year and a half two years weve been very engaged and id say increasingly engaged with clients on where they put their cash they put their cash with us in deposits in repo in money market in money market suites because every one of those areas we offer services to our clients and i think what weve done over time is sharpened our engagement with our clients and thats resulted in more cash and deposits with us in a way that we find is healthy obviously for our balance sheet were always delighted to keep cash but also helps with earnings and margin and economically mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you next question will be from rajiv bhatia at morningstar please go ahead rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research great good morning can you comment on how the pricing environment is for your servicing business if inflation remains higher for longer should we expect lower pricing headwinds and then as i understand it about of your servicing fees is assetbased how do pricing headwinds compare in the assetbased bucket versus the nonassetbased bucket thanks eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 its a broad question weve been in an environment i think the last four years or so where weve seen pricing headwinds in the servicing business to be roughly in the headwind level and that will float around a bit by quarter it will float around on the margin a little bit by year but its substantially below what we had seen way back in which was ill describe a bubble of repricing i described it that way because during this time weve seen to your point a very accentuated rise in inflation weve now seen a partial reduction in inflation and thats not really had a large or substantial effect to our general fee rates or servicing fees and so its been i think its not particularly determinative of that in terms of our fee schedules youre right the fee schedules have several components they have assetbased theres an asset under custody basis for some of the fees which is about half there are some transactional fees there are just some flat fees there are some per account fees and those usually end up being negotiated as a package its not that when there is a when we have negotiations that one particular part of that package is treated very differently we have large sophisticated clients they think of it as a package and to be honest theyre looking for a fair set of a fair amount of fees so that as a partnership which lasts often in some cases years right that they feel theyre getting value and that they feel that we as a custodian can deliver on what their expectations are and so it comes to be a reasonable accommodation i think in our minds in their minds rajiv bhatia q analyst morningstar inc research got it thanks operator thank you next question will be from ken usdin at jefferies please go ahead ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks ron sorry for that earlier just one followup on just the servicing fee algorithm so with all the commentary youve made and you show us the good detail about the business wins and the fees to come on and we know about the headwinds some cyclical some due to deconversion do you have a line of sight when we can really start to see that back office line start to move up in a positive way and i know we have to consider the middle office and the whole front office kit as a together thing but thats still the biggest line and thats still kind of flattish on a yearoveryear basis with all the things we talked about but is there any path forward where you can kind of see some of those headwinds abating and some of the growth starting to come on and transitions that we can see a better growth rate overall thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yeah ken why dont i start here the transition i know it feels like its been going on forever but that will basically abate and the effect of that will go away more or less go away next year assuming no other changes on the client side so a headwind goes to zero secondly and perhaps more importantly you saw the sales performance last year youre seeing the sales performance this year thats building up the tobeinstalled business that still remains very very high for us part of it is some complicated kinds of alpha clients that they will install they are installing they typically tend to install state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 12apr2024 in waves and tranches so well make progress against that but i would note from sales performance last year and it continued in the quarter theres a fair amount of back office in some of these recent sales which just installs faster and so were quite optimistic about the opportunities here in fee revenue growth particularly servicing fee revenue growth as you overcome headwinds but more importantly start to reap the benefits of what weve sold in alpha what we sold in back office and get those installed eric w aboaf a vice chairman chief financial officer state street corp and ken its eric i would just add that weve had these client activity headwinds that we described which is a mix of riskoff sentiment which has led to lower transactions through the custodial accounts and then weve described this shift towards a cash mix right we dont see those just continuing at the same pace we see that as somewhat cyclical i dont think we generally expect much more cash to be on hand with clients i think theres a case to be made that cash levels of clients should actually start to get deployed over the next year and could even be neutral or a possible tailwind so i think weve been going through a bit of a cyclical phase here on those environmental and activity type and mix headwinds and i think without those you could then see through to some of what ron described around sales installation and the underlying growth of the franchise ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and thank you for all that and one followup then is also we can see the wins and what you put on and the yet to be installed to rons point can you just talk about just the pipeline is the pipeline continuing to strengthen is it consistent have you now put more of that pipeline through where do we stand on that ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer director state street corp yeah ken i mean i think what you should have heard from us today is that we have a sales target that we talked about in january were standing by that sales target thats significantly up from last year which was significantly up from the year before so i mean you get there because of the pipeline so were encouraged by our pipeline ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thank you operator thank you and at this time i would like to turn the call back over to ron for closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer director state street corp well thanks to all of you on the call for joining us operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this does indeed conclude your conference call for today
