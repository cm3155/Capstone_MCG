management discussion section operator good morning and welcome to keycorps third quarter earnings conference call as a reminder this conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the conference over to the chairman and ceo chris gorman please go ahead christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer keycorp thank you for joining us for keycorps third quarter earnings conference call joining me on the call today are clark khayat our chief financial officer and mark midkiff our chief risk officer on slide youll find our statement on forwardlooking disclosure and certain financial measures including nongaap measures these statements cover our presentation materials and comments as well as the questionandanswer segment of our call i am now moving to slide this morning we reported earnings of million or per share our results reflect broadbased growth across our franchise supported by our strong balance sheet and disciplined risk management we continue to benefit from our focus on relationship banking and primacy namely having our clients primary operating account we continue to add a deepen relationships in both our consumer and commercial businesses as well as improve both the quality and diversity of our deposits average deposits increased relative to the prior quarter and the yearago period our focus on relationship continues to guide our balance sheet optimization efforts this quarter we reduced average loans by over billion as we deemphasize creditonly and other nonrelationship business importantly our common equity tier ratio increased by basis points to as a result of our proactive balance sheet management riskweighted assets decreased by billion in the third quarter and billion from the beginning of the year which is approaching our full year target of billion the increase in our common equity tier ratio this quarter moves us above our current targeted capital range of to where we would expect to remain for the foreseeable future other capital ratios were relatively stable this quarter including our tangible common equity ratio which was down basis points despite the impact of higher interest rates overall our capital remains strong and we are wellpositioned relative to our capital priorities and the phasein of the proposed future capital requirements although we would not expect the same magnitude of change in risk weighted assets next year we will continue to take steps to manage our balance sheet in conjunction with anticipated regulatory changes net interest income in the quarter reflected the continued high interest rate environment and our balance sheet positioning clark will discuss our balance sheet in his remarks but i would point out that key has a very well defined net interest income opportunity over the next five quarters as our shortterm swaps and treasuries reprice in our slide deck we show net interest income benefit will reach approximately billion on an annualized basis by the first quarter of our net interest margin has been a challenge for us this year we believe however the third quarter represented the low point for the cycle our results continue to benefit from our strong feebased businesses which consistently make up of our revenue this revenue mix will be a clear competitive advantage under the proposed regulatory framework this keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 quarter fee income was up driven by a linked quarter increase in investment banking and debt placement fees we expect investment banking fees to increase again in the fourth quarter based on current pipelines the absolute level of improvement is of course market dependent given the significance of our integrated corporate and investment bank any normalization in the capital markets represents an upside opportunity for key from both a fee generation and balance sheet management perspective in addition to capital markets our fee income will continue to benefit from our strong positions in both payments an area where we have consistently invested and wealth where we benefit from critical mass with assets under management of billion expense management remains a priority our results reflect the successful completion earlier this year of a companywide effort to improve productivity and efficiency we are continuing our efficiency journey by further simplifying and streamlining our businesses as we narrow our focus we will continue to drive additional expense savings which provide the funding to continue to invest in our business finally i want to comment on credit quality which i believe is the most important determinant of return on tangible common equity and shareholder value over time credit quality remains a clear strength of key our credit measures reflect the derisking we have done over the past decade and our distinctive underwrite distribute model this quarter our net chargeoffs were basis points over the next several quarters we expect to continue to operate below our targeted throughthecycle range of basis points to basis points the quality of our loan portfolio continues to serve us well with over half of our ci loans rated as investment grade or the equivalent similarly our consumer clients had a weighted average fico score of approximately at origination as a reminder we have limited exposure to leverage lending office loans and other highrisk categories b and c class office exposure in central business districts totaled million twothirds of our commercial real estate exposure is in multifamily including affordable housing which continues to be a significant unmet need in this country i will close by underscoring my confidence in the longterm outlook for key our businesses are wellpositioned and we continue to strengthen our balance sheet credit quality remains one of our most significant strengths we will continue to focus on maintaining the quality of our loan book and enhancing our risk management framework this positions us well to deliver sound profitable growth and create value for our shareholders with that ill turn it over to clark to provide more details on our results for the quarter clark clark h i khayat chief financial officer keycorp thanks chris im now on slide the third quarter net income from continuing operations was per common share up from the prior quarter and down from last year our results were generally consistent with the guidance we provided for the quarter and weve affirmed the fullyear outlook we shared at our last earnings call as chris highlighted in his remarks our results reflect the strength of our core business focus on primacy balance sheet optimization and our disciplined risk management ill cover each of these strategic focus areas in my remarks this morning turning to slide average loans for the quarter were billion up from the yearago period and down from the prior quarter total loans ended the period at billion down billion from the prior quarter keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 the decline in average loans was driven primarily by a reduction in ci balances which were down almost from the prior quarter the reduction reflects our balance sheet optimization which prioritizes full relationships and deemphasizes creditonly and nonrelationship business as we prepare the balance sheet for a basel iii endgame world the reduction in loans contributed to the decline in riskweighted assets representing roughly half of the rwa decline this quarter rwas were also impacted by our optimization efforts to which we were able to apply more attractive capital treatment to existing portfolios importantly this allowed us to manage rwas proactively while minimizing impact to net interest income turning to slide keys longstanding commitment to primacy continues to support a stable diverse base of core deposits for funding this quarter average deposits totaled billion relatively stable from the yearago period and up nearly billion from the prior quarter the increase in average deposit balances from the prior quarter was driven by an increase in both consumer and commercial deposit balances importantly we have continued to improve the quality of our funding mix by growing core relationship balances and reducing wholesale and broker deposits this quarter broker deposits declined by billion on average and billion relative to periodend balances at the end of the quarter we took advantage of our improved funding profile and called billion of outstanding bank debt for redemption we expect to redeem the debt at the end of october our total cost of deposits was basis points in the third quarter and our cumulative deposit beta which includes all interestbearing deposits was since the fed began raising interest rates in march higher interest rates resulted in the continued deposit mix shift this quarter weve seen this mix shift slow and we are testing reduced rates in certain markets we did not deploy higher rates in our retail business against this july interest rate hike we continue to expect that our cumulative deposit beta will approach by the end of the year turning to slide taxable net interest income was million for the third quarter down from the yearago period and down from the prior quarter our net interest margin was for the third quarter compared to for the same period last year and for the prior quarter yearoveryear net interest income and the net interest margin were impacted by higher interestbearing deposit costs and a shift in funding mix to higher cost deposits and borrowings relative to the second quarter the decline in net interest income reflects a planned reduction in earning asset balances from our balance sheet optimization efforts and higher interestbearing deposit costs our net interest margin and net interest income continue to reflect the headwind from our shortdated treasuries and swaps our swap portfolio and shortdated treasuries reduced net interest income by million and lowered our net interest margin by basis points this quarter we believe that nim bottomed in the third quarter as we see continued benefit from the maturity of swaps and treasuries consistent with our previous comments we expect that we are at or near the bottom on nii in the third quarter we executed billion of spot pay fixed swaps in october subsequent to the quarterend we terminated billion of receive fixed cash flow swaps which were scheduled to mature throughout the swap termination locked in the aoci position of those swaps which will amortize throughout on the original maturity schedule this should have no impact to our aoci position at the end of but will guard against future hikes or a reduction in rates that is slower than the forward curve predicts these actions along with keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 the planned maturity of our shortterm treasuries make key less liability sensitive protect capital and reduce our exposure to higher rates turning to slide as chris mentioned earlier our balance sheet positioning which has been a nearterm drag on earnings represents a clear and welldefined opportunity based on the forward curve which continues to adjust to higher levels we project an annualized net interest income benefit of approximately billion from the maturities of our shortterm treasuries and swaps by the first quarter of well continue to take a measured but opportunistic approach to lock in this benefit moving to slide noninterest income was million for the third quarter of down million from the yearago period and up million from the second quarter the decrease in noninterest income from the year ago period reflects a million decline in corporate services income due to lower customer derivatives trading revenue additionally service charges on deposit accounts declined million driven by the previously announced and implemented changes in our nsfod fee structure and lower account analysis fees related to interest rates the increase in noninterest income from the second quarter reflects a million increase in investment banking and debt placement fees and an million increase in other income from higher trading income and a gain on loan sale im now on slide total noninterest expense for the quarter was billion up million from the yearago period and up million from last quarter compared to the yearago quarter computer processing expense increased million driven by technology investments and personnel expense increased million driven by higher salaries and employee benefits partially offset by lower incentive and stockbased compensation the increase in expenses relative to the prior quarter was driven by personnel expense which increased million from incentive and stockbased compensation a majority of which was from productionrelated expenses and a higher stock price at the end of the quarter as we continue to proactively manage our expense base and simplify and streamline our businesses this will improve the client experience reduce complexity in cost and provide flexibility to continue to invest for the future our goal as expressed previously is to again keep core expenses flat in we expect to have additional efficiencyrelated expenses in the fourth quarter connected with these efforts while not complete we would estimate those charges to be in the range of million well provide full guidance during our fourth quarter earnings call moving now to slide overall credit quality and our related outlook remained strong for the third quarter net chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans while nonperforming loans and criticized loans continue to move up from their historical lows we believe key is wellpositioned in terms of credit migration and potential loss content our provision for credit losses was million for the third quarter and our allowance for credit losses to period end loans increased from to turning to slide we ended the third quarter with a common equity tier ratio of up basis points from the prior quarter and well above our targeted range of to going forward we expect to stay above our current targeted range well determine and share any changes to that targeted range once the new capital rules are finalized we will remain focused on building capital in advance of newly proposed capital rules and continue to support client activity and the return of capital we do not expect to engage in material share repurchase in the nearterm the right side of this slide shows keys expected reduction in our aoci mark the keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 aoci mark is expected to decline by approximately by the end of and by the end of which will provide approximately billion of capital built through that timeframe during the third quarter the aoci position decreased by million in structural burn down the increase in rates specifically in the fiveyear timeframe increased the position by approximately billion which resulted in the net change of million importantly only of our projected billion of aoci reduction between now and is driven by the benefit of lower rates represented in the current forward curve said differently more than of this reduction will occur even if rates remain flat to current levels driven by maturities cash flows and time given the proposed capital rules we believe our reduction in aoci marks along with our future earnings and balance sheet management would allow us to organically accrete capital to the required levels slide provides an outlook for the fourth quarter relative to the third quarter as well as the full year compared to the prior year our guidance uses the forward curve as of september which holds fed funds flat at through august of ending at balance sheet trends are tracking as anticipated we expect average loans to be down to in the fourth quarter versus the prior quarter as we continue to optimize our balance sheet and recycle capital to support relationship clients we expect average deposits to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter our outlook assumes a cumulative deposit beta approaching by yearend we also expect to continue to improve our funding mix and liquidity on a linked quarter basis net interest income is expected to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter changed from our previous guidance of flat to down our guidance for noninterest income has changed to up to reflecting stronger fee income in the third quarter compared to the fourth quarter our full year outlook for fees remains unchanged noninterest expense is expected to remain relatively stable in the fourth quarter excluding the potential fdic special assessment charge additional efficiencyrelated expenses and an expected pension settlement charge of million to million we expect credit quality to remain solid and net chargeoffs to average loans to be in the range of basis points to basis points in the fourth quarter below our expected overthecycle targeted range of basis points to basis points our guidance for fourth quarter gaap tax rate is to once again our full year outlook for versus the prior year has not changed we feel confident in the foundation of our business and in our strategic efforts to strengthen capital and liquidity manage risk and improve earnings with that ill now turn the call back to the operator for instructions for the qa portion of the call operator keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question will come from scott siefers from piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the question christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hi scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co so great news that weve kind of hit the low on the margin and are at or near the bottom on nii i guess im curious does that outlook contemplate any further riskweighted asset reductions that might be outside the scope of the billion youve articulated for this year and i guess along those lines do you think need to do anything beyond what youll do this year i mean it looks like youre kind of ramping up the capital base more quickly so how are we thinking about overall balance sheet size within the scheme of bottoming nii trajectory clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so thanks scott our prop bet was that your first question would be expenses but this is indiscernible so the way i would think about it is weve got it the loan balance is down billion to billion in the fourth quarter i think thats going to be the vast majority of any reduction in the balance sheet we could still see cash come down a bit and we are still doing some optimization efforts they wont carry the same size that we would have seen in this quarter so youll see a leveling off of that and that billion i think is the right number to be focused on r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thats good and thank you i did have an expense question i think you largely hit it in there so ill refrain from asking about that one i guess maybe a broader question though clark i think youve talked about a margin in a normal environment i think thats still well above what would be implied by the extra billion or so benefit through next year so maybe just sort of top level what else would happen have to happen to get you there how are we sort of thinking about that normalized margin clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so to be clear i think 3ish area is again not out of the realm i think to your point scott you adjust it today the basis points that we talked about on drag youd be at would have been last quarter kind of before that so i think its going to be kind of continued asset mix over time and funding mix and what youre seeing if i just point to the third quarter you saw kind of flattish deposits and that included a keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 significant reduction in brokered so more client deposits but the other piece that i think is really important is that we did and we will continue to focus on reducing our reliance on wholesale funding so you would have seen that come down on the order of like billion in the quarter and obviously that has more expense over time now your next question is probably once we get into longterm debt rules and were issuing more wholesale debt how does that impact that i think that weve sized that a little bit we will factor that in but again i think when you start to put all these pieces together in a more normalized environment something in the high to is not out of the realm of possibility r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect all right thank you guys very much clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp thank you operator thank you the next question is from erika najarian from ubs please go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc i guess my question was on the rwa mitigation so i just im going to follow up on in terms of clarks answer to that question so youre pointing us to the billion as the right area which is a lot its a lot of rwa to take out and i guess im wondering number one could you give us a sense of how much has already been taken out and whats to come and second as we think about the net interest income trajectory for next year does the comment of the nii bottoming about here or in the fourth quarter consider the cost of the rwa mitigation that you have left christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure so the answer to the first part of your question erika is were currently through the third quarter weve reduced billion so in the third quarter we reduced billion on a cumulative basis for the year we reduced billion of rwas we are well on target to hit our billion as you try to kind of pivot from rwas to the impact on nii interestingly there is a certain universe of those rwas that we were able to get just different treatment on namely the treatment that we qualified for in any event secondly there was a lot of unused line fees in there that obviously those two categories dont have any impact on nii as you look forward the other reduction in rwas would have a marginal impact on nii but a positive impact certainly on our returns certainly on our margins the other thing that taking out all these rwas enables keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 us to do is to focus on rightsizing our expense base as we take out these rwas so thats kind of how i think about it erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and chris i guess just the follow up to there is basel iii endgame clearly gives the banks time and as you mentioned the moves that youre making in terms of improving the margin being mindful of balance sheet size being mindful of the expense base that the target would be to improve cet1 generation from here i guess how do you balance the notion of okay we have this billion of rwa reduction check thats done and potentially were ready to be a little bit more aggressive in the market or not you tell me one of your peers said that theyre ready for a loan growth next year versus the notion of with us bank being freed from its category commitments whenever everyone runs the data on adjusted cet1 key sort of ends up at the bottom of the list so how do you balance in terms of running the bank daytoday right versus how your investors are thinking about keycorp in sort of this new world order for regulation christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure well first of all as you know the rules are still preliminary and theyre probably likely to change that said were certainly confident that under the proposed current rules including the definitions and the associated timeframes erika that we can hit them and so what we need to do what i wanted to do is sort of when the events of march happened and then these rules came out in july i wanted us to hit the reset button and reset our business and make the difficult decisions so we can get back to growing our business as ive always said the underlying business is in good shape were adding clients on the consumer side were adding clients on the commercial side and what i want to do is rightsize our balance sheet get our loan to deposit where it needs to be get our wholesale funding mix where it needs to be and then free up our people to get back out in the marketplace and do what they do and thats grow our business so that is the needle that were currently threading erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you operator our next question is from the line of peter winter from da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 you guys have mentioned that capital markets should be up in the fourth quarter but i was just wondering just between higher rates and the geopolitical risk just how are you thinking about the outlook for capital markets over the medium term christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp look the medium term i feel really good about it peter over the near term which i would consider the fourth quarter both of the things you mentioned are a challenge we will be up on a linkedquarter basis as i look at our backlog but the absolute as i mentioned in my comments the absolute level of the increase remains to be seen obviously the geopolitical issues are an issue the other thing you think about over the last five or six trading days where the bond market has been that obviously has an impact as well so in the near term i think theres probably additional headwinds but over the medium term i think i feel good about the business private equity firms are starting to transact which is important if you look at the amount of ma that was completed this year in the million to billion area its down about and over time obviously that comes back so in the near term i think well be up i dont know to what degree in the intermediate term as in as you look at when theres clarity on where these rates settle in and some of these geopolitical concerns i think theres going to be a lot of activity peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it and then chris if i could ask about the dividend i mean you have plus payout ratio can you just talk about your commitment to maintaining that dividend and is there any risk that you could be forced to cut the dividend christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so id be happy to address that let me start by just saying my views on our dividend are unchanged as weve managed this business we manage the business for the longterm similarly our board takes the same approach on everything including the dividend and so when we gather in november well review the dividend as we always do in the context of a range of scenarios you were just talking about geopolitical scenarios et cetera the macro conditions but importantly were going to take into consideration as we always do the normalized earnings power of our company and our capital priorities are unchanged we want to support our relationships as our clients and prospects and secondly the dividend the other factors that i think are really important first and foremost is credit quality because theres nothing that denigrates capital more than credit losses i feel really good about our credit quality well also obviously be looking at the burn down of aoci that obviously is tied in and then our ability to organically build capital weve already talked about that a little bit through our reduction of rwas and other actions we took were able to grow our capital per cet1 by basis points this quarter so thats kind of how i think about it but kind of ill end where i started that my views on the dividend havent changed operator and the next question will come from ken usdin from jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 hi thanks good morning clark i was wondering if you could kind of walk through some of the hedging strategy changes slide a lot of new executions and terminations this quarter i guess to start just can you help us understand like the net impact of these new moves in terms of like does that help or hurt fourth quarter nii just to kind of put it into perspective clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure so just to be clear in the on that page ken youll see an incremental billion of paid fixed swaps those were put on to provide some aoci protection to higher rates and then the termination of the billion of pay fix swaps that weve been obviously talking about now for a couple of quarters also done really to guard against higher rates there were the prospect of higher rates or as we said kind of rates that remain higher than the forward curve which is relatively flat now through but has some cuts in the backend so anything thats sort of there or higher will get some protection from both of those positions i would think about it in terms of reducing our kind of nii at risk to higher rates kind of by half to a staged 200basispoint rise so kind of an extreme scenario but were kind of reducing that liability sensitivity there just to protect both capital and earnings ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay so i guess im just trying to figure out with all of that your outlook for stable nii over third weve got the rwa reductions kind of working against that and then we have the slide you gave us on maturities are these new adds also incremental in the fourth to your and helping your fourth quarter forecast clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so if i think about the nii fourth versus third ken the swaps and treasuries maturing which weve talked about and think about like if rates dont change the swap terminations wont have a huge impact versus what weve already shared its really a kind of protection against rates going up the payers will add a little bit of nii because were picking up a little bit of incremental positive carry there and then youll see the benefit of a pull through in the quarter of lower wholesale borrowings ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it okay all right perfect thanks and clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp and all of that incorporates i think this was sorry implicit or maybe explicit in your question it all incorporates the rwa reduction and the loan reductions specifically that we talked about ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thanks and the last just one is just so were going to get that treasury book runoff any updated thoughts in terms of what you do with the rest of the securities portfolio will that continue to just cash flow down as well over time keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so were seeing about anywhere just call it roughly a billion of cash flow per quarter coming out of that book weve used some of that sort of through the course of this year as cash and just shortterm liquidity just given some of the things that have happened youll see us start to deploy that back into the portfolio in a variety of different ways but really focused on bringing the duration of that overall portfolio down ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great thank you clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah operator thank you and the next question is from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi chris hi clark christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey good morning clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc chris you were very emphatic about the strength of the credit book for keycorp which is great can you guys share with us the second derivative risk and what i mean by that is maybe some of the nondepository competitors or even depository competitors in your footprint or franchise may be taking undue risk and you may have a customer that borrows from them as well that could then impact your credit quality do you know if the competitors are being more rational than in prior cycles which would obviously have impact on everybody not just keycorp christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well thanks for your question unfortunately i think because there is excess capacity in the loan market in general i dont think youre seeing the kind of increase in spreads that you would expect to see at this point in the cycle in the private loan market and i dont think youre seeing frankly some of the changes that you would expect to see broadly in terms of structure so i think and as you know ive said many many times on a risk keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 adjusted basis a properly graded standalone credit rarely returns its cost of capital so if im right about that by definition a lot of that stuff in my opinion is underpriced now the other thing that we are seeing obviously and we have great visibility in is our thirdparty commercial loan servicing business where we have over 640someoddbillion that we service but we have over billion that is special servicing so thats where were servicing basically where the workout agent for very complex deals that were not a part of and that business has already set a record for the year at this point in the cycle so that gives you a little bit of an insight into whats going on out there clark would you add anything to that clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah just maybe a couple of things one gerard i think among banks and itd be consistent with all the comments weve made about managing relationships youll see all of us kind of defending our best relationships on the credit side but its with additional business that comes with that to make those relationships hurdle to chriss point about standalone credit so again i think that banks are being rational broadly but defending their best relationships as you would expect if you think about the thirdparty nonbank credit market i would just id make maybe a retrospective comment and a prospective comment looking backward i think theres been a lot of credit thats gone outside the bank market the question i think which is sort of embedded in yours is do some of those kind of call it just for the sake of argument nonbank or fintech originated loans sit on bank balance sheets that would be a question we should be asking broadly we do not at key have much if any of that business the second piece would be around the prospective which is some of the capital rules are obviously making the private credit funds engage in conversations about flow agreements and taking credit over time that is yet to be written but clearly theres a lot of conversation and activity there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you for those insights and then as a followup question clark on the hedging strategy youve given us a lot of detail and we all acknowledge forecasting interest rates is very difficult in fact i find it very interesting if you go back to the federal reserves june dots forecast for the fed funds rate at the end of they were forecasting a fed funds rate they missed it by basis points so my question for you guys the long tail risk what is that in for next year everybody sees youve been very clear about the benefits by the net interest income on an annualized basis first quarter everybody sees that what could go wrong or whats that long tail risk that we need to just keep our eyes on or you guys are keeping your eyes on clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah its probably a couple of versions but if you think right now kind of we are asymmetrically at risk to higher rates and so we are very contemplative of what happens when rates go up because as the treasuries and swaps mature its still there is still a time component right so you feel the cost immediately and the yield sort of pull through we are contemplating things like a stagflation scenario right where its the macro economy is a little softer and you have higher rates i think often we assume weaker economy rates come down there are keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 obviously scenarios where thats not the case so were just trying to think through all the implications of that and the levers and sensitivities that we have to address that i think the other piece over time and weve talked we used to talk more about this before which was rates come down quickly as these things are repricing and can we ensure that were getting the right repricing characteristics when the treasuries and swaps mature weve talked to that around the hedging weve done for and obviously we have other significant advantages right now if rates were to come down rapidly so were thinking about that broad range of conditions gerard and were trying to project our best view of it but were certainly making sure were prepared for different trajectories gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and clark on the comment about rates coming down more rapidly which is a good way i mean i am glad you guys are thinking about that though it doesnt seem likely but if it did happen would your funding costs your deposit rate and you think would they fall as quickly as what would happen on the asset side of the balance sheet from your guys experience or would they lag clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp so the nice thing on the way down from the commercial deposit book which i know you know gerard but its sort of 55ish billion was billion prepandemic so its pretty meaningful for us a lot of thats indexed so itll move when rates move now theyre not all indexed at so youd have to take that into account but that stuff tends to move as the market moves and i think thats a positive whats always tougher to predict is the consumer book which obviously was a little sticky going up and it generally is a little sticky coming down and i think that will be as much a function of micromarket and microcompetitive environment so how are people thinking about those and other sources of funding if rates do come down quickly it does tend to make people being sort of the industry broadly think about wholesale funding differently so you might see more relief on deposits that would cause the consumer to follow faster but the pace at which consumer bet is come down is always the question there gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you so much clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure operator the next question is from the line of john pancari from evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi on the expense outlook just want to see if youd give us some a little bit more color i know third quarter came in a little bit above expectations and some of that is on fee revenue but as you look at fourth quarter and your flat expectation for can you maybe talk about the puts and takes there like what are some of the areas where you could see pressure and where do you really see an opportunity to pull back and keep numbers stable thank you clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure so let me just hit the third quarter for a second john because i just want to clarify so we came in a little bit high as you mentioned i would just point to kind of about million of onetime costs in the quarter related to a legal reserve billed a visa settlement that came in late in the quarter and then some elevated medical claims i think net of those we were sort of consistent with the relatively stable guidance the core in fourth quarter we think will be consistent there as well again relatively stable just to reiterate kind of pointing out a couple of very or a few very identifiable onetimers namely fdic assessment should it come through some additional expense management related charges and a pension charge so relative or net of those we feel like it will be stable the big move also in the quarter was around personnel and that was primarily driven by the change in stock price so that that is a variable but the work that we did earlier in the year as chris referenced kind of the beginning of the year getting flat and some of the work were doing in anticipation of making flat aside from the charges we take will provide a little bit of tailwind on expenses in the quarter and we continue to push hard on real estate and things like thirdparty contracts which we historically have talked to but were moving more and more away from third parties and more focused on using our own folks to do the work were doing so we think we have that circled and there is obviously always surprises that can come through but we feel pretty good about the core stability john pancari q analyst evercore isi and in that real estate rationalization in the thirdparty contracts are they the main areas of opportunity as you look at as well clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp there will be as chris said as you kind of shrink the balance sheet you do have to shrink the expense base and our largest cost is personnel so there will of course be some personnel related to that but we are starting to understand the trajectory of inoffice now and i think were going to be even more aggressive than we have been keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 about real estate positioning and again those thirdparty contracts so i would view it as meaningful pieces of all three of those but certainly people will be part of it christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp and john its chris well continue to work across the board on all of these things were down from an fte perspective in the last year about people teammates and so as we continue to focus on simplifying our business streamlining our business being a smaller simpler more profitable company well have more to say on that as we wrap up the fourth quarter john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks chris if i could just ask one last one on the commercial portfolio shared national credit sorry if i missed this but have you sized up the size of that shared national credit book and then what portion of it than your lead agent christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so weve never given numbers around the snc book everyone obviously just got their snc results and i can tell you in all my time in this business our results were the absolute best weve ever had but weve never disclosed the numbers in terms of dollars or amounts john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay any plans to christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp no we really had its just something that we havent disclosed in the past but as i said our we just got our results back john and just very very pleased with them john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay thanks so much chris operator the next question is from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning manan keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc on the rwa reduction it sounds like youre saying billion down is the right level and you dont see the need to do anymore next year but does that mean you can grow next year and can you lean into loan growth a little bit in certain areas and if so does the level of rates in the tenure matter right so if the tenure moves higher from here does that mean you have to do a little bit more on the rwa side or does that not really matter christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so its a great question when i was answering erikas question its chris when i was answering erikas question were not going to be leaning into rwa reduction in the manner that we have this year but make no mistake we will continue to go through every portfolio we have and rationalize our rwas because thats the raw material for us to also be expanding our client base so were not done on the rwa side the point i was trying to make is at this point in the cycle were going to be doing both manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then as we think about cash and liquidity levels i think you noted there might still be some more room to bring down cash a little bit a lot of your peers seem to be building cash quite meaningfully this quarter so how are you thinking about the right levels of liquidity is it just a function of you might be replacing the maturing treasuries with cash or with other lowduration treasuries and whats the right level do you think you need to hold right now clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah good question so historically manan we wouldve been kind of billion on any given day i think we went as high as billion or billion this year in the kind of billion billion billion range in the quarter i think wed migrate that down to billion to billion over time but your view on as treasuries mature holding those in cash or shorter duration treasury portfolio is the right way to think about it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you operator thank you our next question is from the line of matt oconnor please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning wanted to follow up on expenses and a couple of things i guess first whats the base of expense for this year that youre trying to keep flat too because you have some items coming in called out from this quarter and obviously had some in as well so whats the base as we think about flat cost for that youre targeting clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 i would take the range of kind of billion matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful and then the pension settlement charge just for modeling purposes i know thats ex the guidance for but how much do you expect that to be clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp we said million to million in that range matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay sorry i missed that and then just lastly anything on the criticized loans not everybody discloses this but youve got a slide in your deck that shows it and its bumped up a couple of quarters in a row here is that just kind of normal progression or what would you call out there christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah thats just matt thats us just very critically grading our portfolio thered be a few categories in there as we look through it transportation would be one healthcare would be another therere some consumer product type businesses there but we take a fair amount of pride in and mark midkiff is here in the room with us of really going through with a finetooth comb i dont think theres any additional loss content there but at this point in the cycle and you start looking at anyone that has floating rate debt i think you need to look at that pretty critically so thats really the genesis of it going from to matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thank you christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thanks matt operator our next question is from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp good morning keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc just one i had a quick followup clark for you so i guess going back to some of the discussion you had with ken when we look at the million in nii thats going to come in from the rolloff in the fourth quarter your nii guidance is flat so ex that million nii would be down quarteroverquarter just and i appreciate theres a bunch of moving pieces as we think about the core level of nii beyond fourth quarter rwa optimization deposit repricing like whats your expectation for those deposits for nii sorry does that nii hold flat or do you still expect that nii just on a core basis to drift lower clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so and when you say a core basis sorry just i want to make sure im understanding the question are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc if we remove the lift from the slide that you have from the swaps and the treasury maturities if we didnt have that what in your view would nii do through the next few quarters clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp i got it well so not to be picking word choices but i would say the core is actually without those positions that the underlying business is reflected there so i just thats an important i think ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc sure clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp quality of business point to make but i think youre right on puts and takes and obviously if rates using the forward curve if rates were to stay flat we have seen already in the kind of second quarter to third quarter trajectory deposit pricing has slowed i think nib while running off still a bit is stabilizing so youll still see some drift in those deposit costs i think the places where and obviously were continuing to shrink the loan book a little bit so those create some headwinds as we did say though we are moving aggressively to reduce wholesale funding costs as well and those are obviously relative to deposit costs generally higher so that will provide a little bit of relief against those the trends that youre talking about so i would focus more on what do we think the core business is doing from a performance standpoint which we would view without those swaps and treasuries we did say at or near the bottom on nii i feel good about that again assuming the forward curve the one hesitation i have on that honestly ebrahim is first quarter as you know has one fewer day which has some impacts and always has seasonality in deposit balances so if you go back a decade other than which was an anomaly for pandemicrelated reasons weve always been down kind of to on deposit balances in the first quarter so those are the components were working through and well have a clearer cleaner view on when we guide on the fourth quarter call keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful yeah all im trying to get to is if were at million in the fourth quarter the rolloff should take that million to billion something in that vicinity and im just trying to think what would be the mitigants to getting to a billion quarterly nii by the end of next year but that is good color thank you thats all i have clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure yes operator thank you our next question is from bill carcache from wolf research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning chris and clark i wanted to followup on the points youve made around the nii opportunity from repricing theres a debate around the possibility that some of the upside from the repricing of the swaps and the securities could be offset by the need to further reduce rwa levels beyond that billion level that youve highlighted and yeah i think youve talked around some of the surrounding points but maybe if you could speak to that specifically that would be helpful clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp yeah so maybe just to clarify so that were all talking about the same thing that page i believe which weve shared a few quarters in a row now just to make sure right that is focused on specifically the impact from the treasuries and the swap so as we said before therere other components when rates go up and that improves there are obviously funding pressures as well that come in and conversely when rates come down and these numbers look a little lower theres funding pressure relief so just want to make sure that we are isolating the thing that were talking about as it relates to this pool bill this is obviously hedging a portion of the loan book and not all of the loan book so even if we reduce loans we expect we would see the benefits here but there are obviously nii pressures if we were to continue to reduce the loan book beyond what weve talked about does that answer your question bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood no that is helpful if i may separately wanted to ask if you have a feel like you have a good handle on key customers that had put on swaps when we were still in a lowrate environment and are now going to be facing pressure from rates resetting higher is there any color that you can give on that dynamic i know that credit metrics are very good but i guess any color on that dynamic across your commercial portfolio and to the extent that you feel thats contemplated in the allowance that would be great christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp yeah so theres no bill its chris theres no question one of the things that we are so focused on lets get back to the answer that i gave around criticized the increase in criticized loans we are looking at any customers keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 that are exposed to rate increases however they are so exposed so because we have the primary relationship we know a lot about these customers and to the extent we have visibility on that yes we are looking at that and yes its factored in to our numbers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thank you thank you for taking my questions christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp sure bill operator thank you and the next question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to start so on positive operating leverage if we look at the third quarter revenues down or so year overyear expense is flat just given the trajectory of revenue through is there any chance you could deliver positive operating leverage in and i know you said you plan to hold expenses flat but do you feel more of a sense of urgency to do more on the expense side i think the last time you actually delivered positive operating leverage at least of consequence was christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp so well give as we mentioned were going to give guidance with respect steve to when we report our fourth quarter numbers but we do feel the urgency to continue to do more on expenses and just to remind you we took out million of expenses in the first quarter which is about and we are actively right now as i mentioned simplifying our business were shrinking rwas we will come out with more detail in the fourth quarter but yes we do feel a sense of urgency to rationalize the cost base particularly because as i said were going to be a smaller simpler company steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay is there any chance do you think chris that you do deliver positive operating leverage next year i know weve got more next quarter but how are you thinking right now keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp well know more when we finish our planning for steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and then separately obviously a lot of investor focus on your capital levels im curious given what weve seen out of the 5year and 10year part of the curve so far how does that change the projected aoci impact for yearend so what youre calling out of slide here clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sorry steve its clark can you just be a little clearer how does it change steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so in other words rates are moving up which is working against your aoci youre saying you used the forward curve i dont believe the forward curve in september contemplated the 5year or 10year where it is so where youre saying youll go from negative billion to billion how does that billion change given what weve seen in the intermediate part of the curve clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp got it i dont have that number in front of me its obviously up given where were really sort of focused on the year so we are we have taken as we talked about some steps to at least mitigate that but clearly when rates are moving at this magnitude it cant cover all of it so we continue to watch that closely we managed tce i think reasonably well in the quarter given some of those changes that youve talked about but were really focused on managing assuming as chris said to the contemplated new capital rules and timeframe making sure that were in a position to get our capital to the right level as things phasein and markets move and well take the steps that we need to take to be compliant with those rules steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay fair enough thanks for taking my questions clark h i khayat a chief financial officer keycorp sure christopher m gorman a chairman chief executive officer keycorp thanks steve operator thank you and at this time there are no further questions in queue now i would like to turn the conference back to ceo chris gorman for closing remarks please go ahead keycorp key corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 christopher m gorman chairman chief executive officer
