over to mr young andrew andrew m young chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks jeff and good afternoon everyone ill start on slide of tonights presentation in the first quarter capital one earned billion or per diluted common share the results include one notable item a million gain from the sale of two card partnership loan portfolios in the quarter periodend loans held for investment grew on a linked quarter basis and average loans grew revenue in the linked quarter increased noninterest expense decreased in the quarter driven by declines in both marketing and operating expenses provision expense in the quarter was million as net chargeoffs of million were partially offset by an allowance release turning to slide i will cover the changes in our allowance in greater detail for the total company we released million of allowance in the first quarter and the total allowance balance now stands at billion we continue to hold an elevated amount of qualitative factors to account for a number of uncertainties our total company coverage ratio is now turning to slide ill discuss the allowance and coverage of each of our segments as you can see in the graph our allowance coverage ratio was largely flat across each of our business segments in our total card segment the allowance balance declined million driven by our international card businesses in our domestic card business the allowance balance remained flat at billion with the slight decline in ending loans the flat allowance balance in domestic card resulted in a slight increase in the coverage ratio to in our consumer banking segment the allowance balance declined by million which when coupled with loan growth resulted in a 10basis point decline in coverage to and in commercial the million decline in allowance balance was driven by portfolio credit improvement the decline in coverage ratio was driven by both the allowance release as well as growth turning to page ill now discuss liquidity you can see our preliminary average liquidity coverage ratio during the first quarter was the lcr remained stable and continues to be well above the regulatory requirement the investment portfolio ended the quarter at billion declining by about billion on a linked quarter basis rising rates drove a market value decline of billion with the remaining decline due to our continued efforts to reduce our investment portfolio from the elevated levels during the pandemic turning to page ill cover our net interest margin our first quarter net interest margin was basis points higher than the year ago quarter and basis points lower than q4 relative to a year ago the increase in capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 nim is largely driven by a balance sheet shift as we deployed excess cash to loans the linked quarter decrease in nim was driven by having two fewer days in the first quarter normalizing for day count effect higher yields in both our card business and in our investment portfolio were roughly offset by the impact of hedges on the balance sheet and lower auto yields outside of quarterly day count the nim from here will largely be a function of the changes in our balance sheet mix interest rates and the impacts of competition on loan yields and deposit betas turning to slide i will end by discussing our capital position our common equity tier capital ratio was at the end of the first quarter down basis points from the prior quarter net income in the quarter was more than offset by share repurchases the impact of the cecl transition and higher riskweighted assets recall that the phasein of cecl transition relief began on january we recognized of our billion total after tax phasein amount in the first quarter also in the quarter we repurchased billion of common stock as part of the billion share authorization that our board approved in january earlier this month in addition to approving our ccar submission and our capital plan our board of directors also approved the authorization of up to an additional billion of common stock repurchases that will be available beginning in the third quarter of this year we continue to estimate that our cet1 capital need is around with that i will turn the call over to rich rich richard d fairbank founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp thank you andrew and good evening everyone ill begin on slide with our credit card business yearover year growth in purchase volume and loans coupled with strong revenue margin drove an increase in revenue compared the first quarter of credit card segment results are largely a function of our domestic card results and trends which are shown on slide our domestic card business posted strong yearoveryear growth in every top line metric in the first quarter as we continued our longstanding strategic focus on winning with heavy spenders and building a franchise across the business purchase volume for the first quarter was up yearoveryear and up compared to the first quarter of the rebound in loan growth accelerated with ending loan balances up billion or about yearoveryear ending loans were down just from the sequential quarter better than the typical seasonal decline of around and revenue was up yearoveryear driven by the growth in purchase volume and loans as well as strong revenue margin domestic card revenue margin for the first quarter was revenue margin continued to benefit from spend velocity which is the purchase volume and net interchange growth outpacing loan growth spend velocity is driven by the traction were getting with heavy spenders the margin also includes a gain from a card partnership portfolio sale in the quarter credit results remain strikingly strong the domestic card chargeoff rate for the quarter was a basis point improvement yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate at quarter end was basis points above the prior year gradual credit normalization continued in the first quarter on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the delinquency rate was up basis points capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 noninterest expense was up from the first quarter of driven by an increase in marketing total company marketing expense was million in the quarter our choices in domestic card marketing are the biggest but of course not the only driver of total company marketing trends we continue to see opportunities to book domestic card accounts and loans that can generate resilient and attractive returns and we continue to lean into marketing to drive growth and build our domestic card franchise consumer balance sheets and labor markets are strong and in our own portfolio credit results continue to be well below prepandemic levels and are normalizing gradually were keeping a close eye on competitor actions and potential marketplace risks and as always were underwriting to worsening scenarios even as we lean into marketing our domestic card marketing is evolving and increasing as our decadelong focus on heavy spenders continues to gain traction we increased marketing to grow the heavy spender franchise and drive the successful launch of venture x growth in new accounts and robust customer spending drove an increase in early spend bonuses which show up in our marketing expense and part of our marketing is focused on strengthening our heavy spender franchise with investments in our new travel portal and airport lounges and looking across the whole company our digital transformation is generating new business opportunities like capital one shopping in our card business and auto navigator in our auto business and modern technology infrastructure and capabilities are driving our digitalfirst national direct banking strategy in consumer banking were marketing to continue to propel these growing digital businesses our marketing is paying off across these opportunities we posted very strong growth in domestic card purchase volume new accounts and loans were gaining share and building a longterm franchise with heavy spenders and away from the card business were growing auto originations and deepening dealer relationships with auto navigator and our national direct banking business is winning with customers and driving growth speaking of our auto and retail banking businesses lets move to slide which shows that strong loan growth in our consumer banking business continued in the first quarter driven by auto first quarter ending loans increased yearoveryear in the consumer banking business average loans also grew first quarter auto originations were up yearoveryear on a linked quarter basis auto originations were up our digital capabilities and deep dealer relationship strategy continued to drive yearoveryear growth in our auto business we continue to closely monitor competitive and credit dynamics in the auto marketplace first quarter ending deposits in the consumer bank were up billion or yearoveryear average deposits were also up yearoveryear consumer banking revenue grew from the prior year quarter driven by growth in auto loans partially offset by declining auto loan yields and the early effects of our decision to completely eliminate overdraft fees the yearoveryear decrease in auto loan yields was driven by a mix shift toward prime loans and our focus on booking higher quality loans within credit segments across the auto lending industry the pace of price increases has not kept up with the pace of rising interest rates the decline in loan yields coupled with the pace of pricing changes has compressed margins in our auto business first quarter provision for credit losses swung from a net benefit of million in the first quarter of to a net expense of million the allowance for credit losses in our auto business was flat in the quarter compared to an allowance release in the year ago quarter the auto chargeoff rate and delinquency rate are gradually capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 normalizing and remains strong and well below prepandemic levels the chargeoff rate for the first quarter was up basis points yearoveryear the 30plus delinquency rate was up basis points yearoveryear on a linked quarter basis the chargeoff rate was up basis points and the 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points slide shows first quarter results for our commercial banking business which delivered strong growth in loans deposits and revenue in the quarter first quarter ending loan balances were up yearoveryear driven by growth in selected industry specialties and increasing utilization average loans were up ending deposits grew from the first year from the first quarter of as middle market and government customers continued to hold elevated levels of liquidity quarterly average deposits increased yearover year first quarter revenue was up from the prior year quarter noninterest expense was also up commercial credit performance remained strong in the first quarter the commercial banking annualized charge off rate was basis points the criticized performing loan rate was and the criticized nonperforming loan rate was in closing we continue to drive strong growth in domestic card revenue purchase volume and loans in the first quarter we also posted strong auto and commercial growth credit is gradually normalizing and remains strikingly strong across our businesses and we continue to return capital to our shareholders pulling way up we are wellpositioned to capitalize on the accelerating digital revolution in banking our modern technology stack is powering our performance and our growth opportunity and its the engine of enduring value creation over the longterm and now well be happy to answer your questions jeff jeff norris senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp thanks rich ph start the qa session as a courtesy to other investors and analysts who may wish to ask a question please limit yourself to one question plus a single followup if you have any questions following the qa the investor relations team will be available after the call keith please start the qa capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks so obviously the investor sentiment has turned quite cautious on the consumer but it seems like rich you think credits doing i mean clearly credit is doing quite well in your loan book and you guys are leaning into growth maybe you could just give us some perspective on some of the macro headwinds that the consumer is facing and sort of how you see it progressing through the portfolio as the year progresses thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay hey sanjay yes so lets just talk about the health of the consumer i think the us consumer continues to be strong while the savings rate has reverted back to prepandemic levels the cumulative impact of savings over the last two years is still a significant positive we see this in higher bank account balances and higher household net worth and it is true across the income spectrum now of course the bulk of government stimulus is now behind us and most industry forbearance programs are winding down but i think well see some sustained benefits from consumer deleveraging through the pandemic debt servicing burdens are lower than theyve been in decades supported both by deleveraging and by low interest rates on the other side of the consumer balance sheet labor market demand remains strong so in our own portfolio sanjay we see continuing strength in roll rates cure rates and recovery rates and even as we see signs of normalization our credit metrics remain strikingly strong by any historical standard there are emerging headwinds as well for example high price inflation inflation has the potential to erode the excess savings consumers accumulated through the pandemic especially if price increases continue to run ahead of wage growth and also higher interest rates would push debt servicing burdens back up but if we pull off on the whole id say consumers are in good shape coming out of the pandemic relative to most historical benchmarks in fact ive just learned over the years that ive got a lot of confidence in how what consumers learn from downturns and scares that they have and the choices that they make and i think were just seeing very rational behavior by consumers i worry more about markets and how competitors operate and lending practices and things like that we can save that for another question but we still feel good about the consumer and look it is a natural thing it would be an unnatural thing for credit to stay where it is and so normalization the root word in normalization is normal and theres quite a journey to really sort of an equilibrium place for credit performance and one of the reasons that were still leaning pretty hard into our growth opportunities is our confidence in the consumer and our read of the marketplace at this time sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 okay great and a followup question on some of the regulatory scrutiny were seeing theres been some chatter on card loan fees and overdraft fees the latter of which i think you guys have gotten in front of maybe you could just talk a little bit about the card loan fee the card fees chatter out there from some of the regulators and how it might affect your business thanks richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah well sanjay we as a company have been very focused on minimizing fees just in general for our consumers obviously the overdraft announcement was a pretty dramatic case in point there but even in the card business when you look really what capital one has is an apr and a late fee and in some cases a cash advance fee both of those fees are really to discourage certain behaviors that we dont think are in the interest of the consumer so yes so our strategy has been to have pricing be upfront and have it be clear and very simple now late fees are something that we have continued to have late fees because we wouldnt want our loved ones ending up paying late on their bills so just late fee i think is one of the natural fees that probably make sense to have on a product the fed has created a safe harbor with respect to late fees maybe the industry will that will be revisited and obviously we will watch that as we continue our business jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my question can we just talk a little bit more about the partnership portfolio sale how to think about that from an asset perspective and the impact on the pl in terms of revenue and any associated decline in expenses associated with that sale andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah rick its andrew i mean we disclosed the overall gains between the two portfolios of million the two portfolios combined you saw probably last year when they got marked held for sale were roughly billion but below the surface there were not going to get into specifically the run rate of revenue or the expenses associated with that in part because were growing the rest of the portfolio and youre going to see partnership businesses come in and out over time richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 operator well take our next question from bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good afternoon rich and andrew you have unique insight into consumers at both ends of the credit spectrum could you parse out for us in a little bit more detail just following up on sanjays question specifically at what kinds of credit normalization trends youre seeing at both the high end and the low end of the credit spectrum if you could sort of juxtapose those for us and maybe call out any differences and then perhaps any possibility that inflationary pressures could lead to a bit faster normalization at any at the lower end richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah hey bill so we have for quite a long time saying we should all expect normalization in terms of what we see in normalization its pretty early and pretty modest in fact if anything i guess we would were sort of struck by how moderate the pace is but we shouldnt necessarily count on that but it is certainly striking so far what we are seeing in normalization is really across the credit spectrum and across the income spectrum it does seem that normalization is a bit more pronounced at the lower end of the market if you sort of measured either in terms of income or credit score but those are also populations that improved more and more quickly earlier in the pandemic so thats so i think were seeing and we would expect this is and across the boards kind of return toward normal over time with respect to inflation we worry a lot about inflation and that is something that especially if inflation as weve seen and what it costs to live is faster than wage inflation these can put pressures and sometimes can put pressures more on the in the more mainstreet america and so its something that we worry quite a bit about and i think that it would be very natural for these inflation pressures to put more pressure on consumers bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you richard its really helpful if i may ask a related followup maybe could you discuss the extent to which positive credit migration fueled by pandemic stimulus that perhaps may have led you to increased line sizes and then now to the extent to which we could sort of see a reversal in that and perhaps as credit normalizes would you expect negative credit migration to ultimately lead to a reversal of those line sizes or is that not how it worked richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah over the years we have worked hard to originate accounts and weve said its kind of a coiled spring of growth opportunity and we uncoiled the spring gradually based on customer performance and also the marketplace and so we have as part of the growth that you see while its being powered by very strong originations and some return to spending and card usage by the back book we also have been selectively increasing credit lines nothing dramatic but its consistent with my earlier comments about the consumer and again with great demonstration by the performance of our customers we have been selectively increasing credit lines and i think i dont see anything that would change our lean in that direction again its selective and it assumes a worsening capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 environment it assumes normalization all of those things so i dont think wed be set up to be surprised there and i dont see i dont have any conversations about trying to reverse that direction jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from john pancari with evercore isi please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good evening on the regarding the credit on the reserve front i know you had released an incremental million and you indicated that you do have additional qualitative reserves aside i know your reserve ratio right now is near your day one cecl level how should we think about the potential for incremental reserve releases from here do you think that we stabilize at this level of the reserve ratio or do you think theres incremental room to release andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp well john when you quote the this is andrew by the way when you quote the reserve level keep in mind that theyre pretty significantly different reserve levels by asset class and so the total company level of course is influenced by that mix so i would suggest we decompose it a bit by each of them because auto was a little bit below where it was on cecl day one and thats largely a function of the elevated used car prices our mix in prime so were seeing loss rates that are much below i think basis points was the number this quarter and so all else equal you would expect that our coverage ratio there would be well below what it was at adoption and yet its only a little bit below and thats for the qualitative factors there but the largest factor to the total company reserve will clearly be card and thats one where i think its always helpful to just start with a reminder of how that allowance is constructed because answering your question is really dependent on a number of assumptions where quite frankly your guess could be as good as mine and so with card the first thing that goes into the allowance is just the expectation of future losses and recoveries and you can see whats in our delinquency buckets in the near term but beyond that we assume that theres a relatively swift normalization of losses from those unusually strong levels historically strong the second is the size of the balance sheet which you saw this quarter is growing at a quite healthy pace when you normalize quarteroverquarter for seasonal effects and certainly up i think the number is in q1 for card relative to a year ago and then the third input is that level of qualitative factors and thats really just to account for a variety of risks related to inflation and various things that are impacting that and just uncertainty in the more macro economy and so the future allowance is really going to be determined by how all of those effects net out the one thing that i will just remind you is what we call the quarter swap effect and that is as credit begins to normalize we will be replacing a currently low loss quarter with a slightly higher loss quarter so thats another thing that will create pressure all else equal capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 but if favorable credit trends continue and the factors driving those qualitative reserves subside we could see the allowance be down to flat but if normalization plays out and were growing at a significant clip i wouldnt anticipate that well see allowances release in fact i could see allowance builds so its really just a function of all of those factors sorry for the longwinded technical answer there but i just think all of those factors are really important for you to understand because the range of outcome on the allowances is quite large john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it okay andrew thank you and then my followup question is just around consumer spend behavior and volumes on behavior are you seeing any shifts in spending on discretionary shifting towards nondiscretionary and then secondly are you on the volume side do you forecast a slowdown in card spend volume overall as the fed hikes and aims at slowing the economy thanks andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp thanks john i have not looked recently at discretionary versus nondiscretionary so i dont want to speculate on that i will tell you a thing that is certainly striking is whats happening with te spend these days just by way of comparison te spend was up compared to the first quarter of of course that was a very depressed quarter but up around from first quarter levels so theres a lot of i think with people sort of just bursting out and wanting to free themselves from some of what theyve been through in the pandemic we certainly see strength there but i think your question about as really inflation hits and we see just a lot of downstream effects that can happen from that that certainly could impact card spend but i would say a lot of the traction that we have in card spend is coming from our really spenderfocused business and frankly heavyspenderfocused business and i think that im not sure that a change in inflation is going to have necessarily that much impact on the propensity of the heavy spenders will spend jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good evening everyone andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey ryan richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey rich andrew so maybe just to start off rich you referenced the competitive landscape out there in card and auto a few times i think you said larger upfront bonuses and youre closely watching some of the competitive dynamics can you maybe just talk about what youre seeing out there and i think historically its been unusual for you to be growing this fast when the rest of the market is also growing so im just wondering can you maybe just talk about on the card side what are you seeing banks versus nonbanks and anything youre seeing on the auto side would be helpful at this point richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay ryan i do have to smile at your comment because often we have zagged well zigged while others zagged and we you and i in fact have chatted about that and the reasons sometimes behind it because and its not just an accident that that sometimes has been our pattern because part of what were reading is the competitive marketplace and that has impact on the opportunity and on credit performance and selection dynamics and a lot of things so your question is a great one but i think a lot of companies out there see the strength of the consumer they are sort of feeling the consumer sort of roaring back with respect to more normal activities and i think people are leaning in to take advantage of that and certainly we are but we let me talk a little bit just about the competition in the card business we certainly know that theres elevated marketing all the companies are pretty much coming out and showing more marketing talking about more marketing so that is happening and we have a careful eye to see what that does to the opportunity that were experiencing but ill kind of come back to our opportunity there but certainly marketing levels are elevated competition in the rewards space is probably a notch more intense than prepandemic levels but its pretty stable in recent quarters and not what i would call irrational certainly there are incredibly good players at the top of the market and theres a lot of competition there but that hasnt really altered our view of the opportunity either aprs have generally been stable turning to the fintechs for a second obviously weve seen a lot of buy now pay later activity i think that we should note that the fintechs who are in the lending business have been lending in the greatest rearview mirror of credit industry credit performance that you could ever imagine and businesses like installment lendingbased businesses sometimes are pretty sensitive in that environment so i but we continue to see quite a bit of activity on fintechs as well but on the card side before i turn to auto we have an eye on the competition i think generally though the competition while intense is not unreasonable we have not seen the big changes in peoples underwriting policy the kind of things that we havent seen dramatic changes in pricing so i think its more i would label it at the intense level that we would expect at a time like this but not unreasonable and not something that would cause us to move off our pretty strong lean into the growth opportunity so in the auto business let me just talk a little bit about this the competition in the auto business continues to remain intense its showing up across the board from credit unions big banks and small independent lenders capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 and its playing out across all credit segments and you just kind of doubleclick into that for a second credit unions that have been awashed with deposits theyve been gaining significant share consistent with what weve observed during prior cycles and especially as interest rates go up a little bit and lets talk in fact about rising interest rates i think its almost always the case in business that when in a sense the cost of goods sold rises there typically is a lag in how that makes its way into consumer pricing what weve as i mentioned in the earlier comments we have not seen the marketplace the auto marketplace yet respond in terms of pricing relative to whats actually happening to interest rates so there is some compression there i think typically what weve seen in the past is competitors respond with differing speeds to interest rate increases so sometimes players like credit unions tend to and maybe they have different ftp methodologies or whatever tend to be sort of the slowest to respond but we so well have to keep an eye on that but i think that we are really excited about our opportunity in the auto business the technology products that we have out there are really cutting edge and getting a huge amount of traction our ai is just very careful on the pricing out there and also just whether there is an overexuberance relative to the number of planets that aligned in the auto lending business particularly what sort of happened to used car values and in effect thats still there just keep an eye on whether that industry can remain as rational as its been in the last couple of years ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe as a quick followup sticking with things that are unusual andrew you guys are continuing to aggressively return capital i think you have two different billion ph assets out there which again is unusual for you guys i was wondering can you maybe just talk a little bit about the timing of the utilization of those and how do you think about use of capital as youre getting closer to the cet1 target thank you andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp yeah recall that in january we did not have an active program at the time so our board authorized billion and capital levels were even higher than they are today at that point and so earlier this month in conjunction with the approval of the capital plan and our ccar submission they authorized an additional billion which coincides with the capital plan and therefore would be available at the start of the third quarter but in terms of the pace of that activity it feels a little bit different than it did when we were at over a year ago to your point like asymptotically were sort of heading towards and so the pace of repurchases is as always going to be dependent on our primary use of capital for loan growth and then the dividends but beyond that were going to keep a really close eye on just the level of capital and earnings and growth and market dynamics and take advantage of the fact that were able to operate under the scb framework and maintain that flexibility so nothing specific in terms of the time line there but just wanted to be clear about the approvals when we announced it a few weeks ago jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good evening andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp hey betsy richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp hey good evening betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess just switching gears a little bit i wanted to ask a little bit about what youre seeing with regard to payment rates and is there any differentiation amongst the customer base as to how thats been trajecting richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so betsy we continue to see elevated payment rates across our customer base and while lately its been sort of flattening out if you will i mean payment rates are just well above prepandemic levels and while not a perfect proxy you can see these trends in our trust metrics where the payment rate in march remained close to one of the more recent drivers of higher payment rates is really the flip side of amazingly strong credit and healthy consumer balance sheets and we certainly expect consumer credit to gradually normalize even though its kind of been happening a little slower than one might otherwise expect and i certainly believe payment rates will remain sort of the flip side of really strong credit so over time the normalization of credit plausibly leads to some normalization of higher payment of normal of payment rate i think theres another phenomenon happening sort of on little cat feet behind our payment rate numbers and that is that each year were gaining more and more traction with heavy spenders also you may remember for years we talked about gosh this goes all the way back to the great recession capital ones systematic avoidance of highbalance revolvers which leaves a lot of revenue and earnings on the table during the good times but is a move for the sake of resilience but i think the sort of systematic effects of avoiding highbalance revolvers and the systematic effects of more and more traction with heavy spenders also has created somewhat of a sort of more sustainable change in our payment rate as well but certainly probably the biggest factor of the moment is the rate at which consumers are being so creditworthy and putting so much of their money into payments betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then just as a followup on the marketing piece i know we spoke about it a little bit earlier in the call but as were thinking through the opportunities that we have do you feel like theres an opportunity to lean into marketing kind of q by q by q to a greater degree so we should build off of such that our marketings higher capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 yearonyear full yearfull year thats what im getting from the conversation earlier but i just want to make sure its the right takeaway richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp well yeah let me just why dont i do this betsy let me just pull up and sort of talk about marketing overall and then we can kind of come back to the quarter that we just had there are a few things driving our marketing levels higher these days first of all the opportunities that we see were seeing attractive growth opportunities across our businesses and were leaning hard into them while the opportunities are there in our card business we have continued to expand our products and the marketing channels that were originating in and these opportunities are significantly enhanced by our technology transformation which has enabled us to leverage more data access more channels leverage machine learning models and enable customized solutions so were seeing significant traction in originations across our business and i want to note that so much of our card business overall and our growth is in our branded card franchise as opposed to cobrand and private label partnerships and by the way we also like those businesses but for capital one thats a relatively smaller proportion of our business and in branded card we enjoy the full economics of the business and we own the customer franchise so while the industry doesnt track data on this i think our share growth in branded cards is particularly noteworthy and branded card is of course as the word implies its about our brand and we continue to invest in the companys brand and in the flagship products and some of the strength that you see in our revenue margin comes from having so much branded card where we own all the economics but the flip side of that is that the marketing and the brandbuilding are entirely on us and that all shows up in our marketing numbers but thats an absolute centerpiece of building a highly valuable franchise now second important driver of our growing marketing spend is the continued traction were getting in our more than decadelong journey to drive more and more upmarket with a focus on heavy spenders so we launched our venture card way back in and that was the beginning of that strategic push for heavy spenders but it hasnt just been about flagship cards its been about working backwards from what it takes to win with heavy spenders and thats about great products with heavy reward content its about great servicing its about customer experiences tailored for heavy spender lifestyles and of course an exceptional digital experience so for years weve been on this journey and every year weve had growing traction and while our whole franchise of spenders has grown nicely weve grown even faster with heavier spenders and with each year of success weve had the license to stretch a little higher upmarket and were continuing to invest to make that possible and lately youve seen our launch of our travel portal which has garnered some rave reviews in the marketplace youve seen the launch of airport lounges which have a special appeal to the top of the market and the frequent travelers and last fall we launched venture x which moved us into the next tier of premium cards and that launch has been very successful and we continue to invest in the growth of that product you can see some of the results from our continued quest for heavy spenders in the tremendous purchase volume growth that weve had over any time period you pick over the last decade or shorter time periods youll find capital one posting really high in your top of the league tables if not at the top of the league tables purchase capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 volume growth and also note that almost all of the heavy spender growth is in our branded cards and thats why you can see such strength in spend velocity and our revenue margin this journey for the heavy spender has a different economic mix than some of our traditional card business it has higher upfront costs of brandbuilding higher upfront costs of marketing and promotions and of course investment in highend experiences but longterm value of the heavy spender franchise is tremendous with high spend levels strong margins very low losses low attrition and a lift to our brand and really the rest of our franchise so the spender franchise is already making its mark on many line items of our financial performance and thats a continuing longterm benefit of these investments i just want to mention a third factor contributing to the higher marketing is some of the traction that were getting with our new digital offerings including auto navigator capital one shopping and our national bank and just to comment on the national bank which unlike capital one unlike other banks who are driving growth through bank acquisitions we are focused on continuing to build our bank organically which of course does take marketing investment so that was just taking a chance to share with you what is behind the pretty high levels of marketing that youre seeing and the great opportunities that we see for our franchise and to grow it now due in part to the current marketplace environment and importantly capitalizing on our strategic quest those quests being our building of the modern tech stack and the continued move upmarket these things are contributing to driving higher marketing levels these days so thats sort of a pulling up sort of a narrative on why it is that were leaning hard into marketing and its a combination of sort of the opportunity of the moment as well as capitalizing on the journey thats been many years in the making typically we have a seasonal dip in marketing levels this year an important contributor to our marketing was things related to the for example the launch of venture cards early spend bonuses and things like that so things are not its not quite as strong and a seasonal effect this year as it has been in other years were not specifically giving guidance on the rest of the year but i just wanted to share with you why it is that were leaning into marketing whats driving that and i am as you can probably tell from the answer im really enthused about our opportunities and we are though leaning in to take advantage of them and a lot of thats about marketing jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich just wondering what would it take to see both kind of you talked about some of the potential pressures particularly for the lower end consumer in terms of inflation and other sorts of things what would it take to actually start to see you pull back both at the lower end consumer and for the higher spenders like what sort of what would be the warning signs richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 yeah so moshe with respect to the lower end consumers its less about lets imagine we dont have to do very much imagining to envision environments that are more difficult than this one where the consumer is in a more challenged place where the competitors have gone a whole notch more aggressive and what i think is more our pattern in that case is to particularly use the credit line lever to manage the risk as opposed to just a big dial back say in origination machines so were just more cautious online try to continue to build the franchise maybe not as aggressively as sometimes but again we have over our years moshe in building sort of the mainstreet franchise really do a lot of the regulating of things on the line side on heavy spenders we continued to find so much traction and what ive often said about the quest for heavy spenders unlike a lot of things that ive seen in our business journey this is not a thing that is very wellsuited to a blitz here a pullback a blitz and a pull back now that doesnt mean we wouldnt be dialing the knobs up and down on certain things like marketing or choices or product or whatever but this is and i think theres a reason that not very many players are really really successful at the top of the market this is about really building a franchise at that end of the market thats not just taking regular consumer products and dressing them up with more rewards or fancy advertising and thats why i mentioned this journey that were like in the 12th year of the journey where we declared were going to just keep moving upmarket one cant do it overnight its something you have to earn along the way but all of our metrics continue to show traction and success traction on brand metrics as well and pretty much all the customer metrics youve seen whats happening on purchase volumes when we track the things that we have booked over the years we sort of love the annuities were booking so that to me is something that were going to keep pursuing as we have for a long time but what we will the things that we will throttle along the way are certain marketing choices certain product choices but that one i partly shared want to share this a little bit more about this today that thats a journey that capital ones been on as part of our central part of our strategy in card for a lot of years moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks rich and maybe as a followup could you talk a little bit about where you see the industry and capital one in terms the deposit price competition as were now starting to see in deposit betas as were now starting to see interest rates moving up andrew m young a chief financial officer capital one financial corp sure moshe its andrew and recognizing that retail deposits are of our portfolio ill focus on that and over the last gosh sixish years we had the falling rate cycle over the last couple where betas were right around and then the last rising cycle which was from the late i think to early our cumulative beta was right around and so betas are generally slow to rise over the first couple of hikes but keep in mind that that last rising rate cycle we had eight hikes over years i believe it was whereas in this cycle we could see four hikes that each equal basis points and get up to or as forward suggest quite quickly so i could make a case that industry betas will be higher or lower than that history on the lower side theres elevated deposit balances across the industry the loantodeposit ratios are quite low industry nims are low and were moving off a zero floor but the flip side is the larger and quicker rate hikes the possibility of some more aggressive pricing by institutions that are more reliant on those funds or deposits to fund loan growth and institutional surge deposit runoff capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 so just want to give you a flavor of i think theres a lot that were going to learn over the course of the next few months but as we look at all and have a point estimate that kind of run through all of our assumptions our point estimate at this point is that its going to largely be in line with that rising the last rising cycle of something like basis points that starts off a little slower and picks up but again this starts off slower might be a particularly condensed timeframe relative to what we saw in that last cycle jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc quick question on the outlook for the adjusted efficiency ratio from q1 levels and then rich on commercial card issuing can you talk about that business and i noticed youve been marketing a no limit small business card which has been sort of tough for banks to roll out richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp okay don thank you yeah weve been focused on improving our operating efficiency ratio for years and the pandemic also accelerated the technology race and raised the stakes for all players across many industries and certainly in banking and i think for every player the clock is ticking on their tech readiness and companies are waking up to the investment imperative and weve talked about the investment flowing into fintechs is breathtaking and the arms race for tech talent is the fiercest that i have seen in any time in my career and in any job family so theres an urgency in responding to the marketplace but i do want to also say that the fastmoving marketplace is also the creator of our opportunity and i think capital ones uniquely positioned to take advantage of that opportunity and thats why were investing now so really this is very similar message to what i said last quarter what ive been saying for a long time were still very focused on the opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement over the longer term the engine that powers it is revenue growth and digital productivity gains but the timing of efficiency improvement needs to incorporate the imperatives of the current marketplace so but delivering positive operating leverage over time continues to be an incredibly important north star to us and frankly one of the most important payoffs of our technology journey and an important element of how we deliver longterm value so i think you have sort of seen you can see some of the effects of what im talking about in the first quarter operating efficiency and when you adjust for gains from portfolio sales in the quarter so i think its very similar conversation to what i was saying last time we can see some of the evidence of that in the quarterly numbers but the current pressure doesnt change at all our belief in the longer term opportunity to drive operating efficiency improvement jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 don what was your question on commercial donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp oh sorry sorry you wanted to donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc my question was that rich your outlook on commercial i know as you roll out a no limit small business card which has been tough for banks to do i didnt know if maybe youre using the public cloud just want to see your thoughts on that richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp yeah so when youre talking about yeah commercial youre talking about here our business card business credit card you may have seen the ads on tv that talk about no preset spending limit thats it thats it more complicated way to just say in a sense not a credit limit that gets hardwired this is something that is dynamically there isnt a credit line per se this is dynamic transaction underwriting in real time its a very hard thing to build its taken us years to get there and its absolutely one of the many many benefits of the tech transformation weve done and the journey to the cloud and the building of modern applications and modern platforms and so ive always said to investors will often ask where can i see what is the i want to reach out and touch the benefit of your tech transformation and all the money weve spent on that and ive said look theres not going to be any one thing that you point out and say oh my gosh thats i now see everything this is about this journey is a journey that when we years ago when we kind of said someday wed like to do this thing over here someday wed like to do that wed also like to have much better efficiency wed like to better risk management wed like to do lots of things and the striking thing was all the things that we wanted to do usually in life they are you have to pick some and its all about tradeoffs what im struck by in this journey is theres a shared path to all the things that years ago we set out to do and that path relates to building modern technology across the company from the bottom of the tech stack up and that is what weve done and then over time you as investors will see manifestations of that you see wow that auto navigator product capital one built that can underwrite every car in america for any consumer in a fraction of a second thats striking and then one sees wow so you actually have a no preset spending limit thats striking and we didnt do the journey for the sake of any one of those but i think on an increasing basis investors will see examples of things that stand on the shoulders of the years of investment weve made in technology and things that also by themselves like this card thing were talking about is itself within that a journey that took a bunch of years but its all about working backwards from wins with customers and thats why were doing that capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you jeff norris a senior vice presidentglobal finance capital one financial corp next question please operator our final question this evening will come from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks very much guys for fitting in my question rich you talked a lot about credit and the strength of your customer base aside from that we are seeing call it some of the more modern or emerging platforms were observing some delinquency drift there and in fact were even seeing some reactions in the capital markets some securitization deals are getting canceled or renegotiated as they go im wondering what do you ascribe that to and are there any reverberating effects from that type of development or migration into your business over time richard d fairbank a founder chairman president chief executive officer capital one financial corp so john as i often say with a smile capital one was one of the original fintechs we were a fintech before fintechs were a word but if you think about what we did is we built a lending company started with cards but were ultimately building a broadbased financial institution one thing that enabled that journey to happen is the advent of the capital markets and we were able to ride the very meteoric growth of capital one in the based on securitizations and things and so we were very grateful for that but at the same time we then did probably one of the most things that i think most shocked our investors i guess it didnt shock them because we spent a lot of years talking about it before we did it but a striking thing when we chose to transform our company to a traditional bank balance sheet because we wanted to create much greater resilience in our funding so the reason i mentioned that is as we were in the old days and as fintechs that are built on securitization have an opportunity to grow quickly but they also have a just an inherent structural challenge with resilience so for all of them they need to and their investors need to keep a careful eye on that i want to talk just a little bit about you mentioned some of the lending results and some of the uptick so first of all we shouldnt be surprised to see upticks in delinquencies just for companies in general whether they are banks or some of the fintechs typically companies that have a less of a history of consumer credit data are probably more challenged with respect to how to read this rearview mirror i mean the example lets just say that you created a fintech in the last couple of years how would one look in the rearview mirror and determine where resilience is and where it isnt since in general pretty much everybody did well so thats one of the challenge any new company has is building a deep enough credit history to do that so ill say thats just a challenge they bring to the table its not their fault its a structural thing capital one financial corp cof corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2022 the other thing that always happens with normalization is normalization tends to happen faster on front books than back books and so part of what you may be seeing on fintechs is if theyre highgrowth fintechs just the proportion that their front book represents as a percentage of the whole is quite different and it would be surprising if they didnt normalize faster given that typically front books normalize faster than back books and a lot of us have seasoned back books with years of experience with them and thats also very helpful in a normalization journey so as one that was an original fintech i have great fascination with the fintechs a lot of respect for a lot of things theyre doing but i also know that there are some structural things that theyre going to have to confront that they and their investors will have to keep an eye on john hecht q analyst jefferies
