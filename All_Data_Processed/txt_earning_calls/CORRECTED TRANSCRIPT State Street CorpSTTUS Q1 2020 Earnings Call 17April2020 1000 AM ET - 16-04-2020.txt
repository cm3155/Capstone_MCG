over to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks ilene and good morning everyone you will have seen that today we released our first quarter earnings results i am pleased with our performance during such turbulent times and i am proud of our team members worldwide who achieved these results the covid19 health crisis has necessitated a rapid curtailment of economic activity which in turn has driven significant financial market volatility and a lack of liquidity in some fixed income markets the markets in general and state street specifically have withstood the volatility well central banks moved quickly to help alleviate market stress and state streets longstanding business continuity planning supplemented by rapid innovation has enabled us to operate protect our employees and serve our clients exceptionally well throughout this period we have continued to execute against our strategy which is reflected in our strong performance before discussing our quarterly financial performance i want to review some of the actions that we have taken in support of our clients and to protect the safety of our global workforce all while remaining focused on state streets operational excellence resiliency and business performance state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 turning to slide i will outline some of the key aspects of state streets response to the pandemic as a global company operating in countries we have been addressing the coronavirus since its very inception with significant operations and approximately employees in china we have somewhat of a head start on adapting our global operating model to the rapidlychanging needs of our clients as well as to the safety concerns of our approximately employees across the globe our actions in response to this global health crisis have centered on maintaining employee safety and business continuity and resilience while concurrently supporting our clients the financial markets and the broader economy let me start with our people here our senior global crisis team has worked continuously since midjanuary with local management and relevant authorities across the world to safeguard employee health and wellbeing our it capabilities rapidly allowed us to add capacity for remote access solutions while also maintaining cyber safety and today approximately of our global workforce is working from home we announced that through the end of the year we suspended any workforce reductions other than ph poor performance or conduct reasons in light of the covid19 crisis i believe this is the right decision for our people our clients and our communities it aligns with our culture and values and reflects our financial strength we are undertaking actions to offset the cost of this decision which we will describe later in the presentation let me turn to our clients in the broader markets the macroeconomic environment remains uncertain and the pace and timing of an economic recovery will influence investor behavior financial market conditions and our clients who are the owners and managers of the world capital state street plays ph a central role in the infrastructure of the global financial system this crisis has demonstrated our deep operational capabilities at a time of significantly increased business volumes our global operating model has enabled us to run split operations where we can efficiently transfer work with minimal disruption to client service at a time when we have seen a significant expansion in activity for example in march we experienced a increase in backoffice transactions and an over increase in middleoffice transactions similarly valuation checks for nav calculations due to significant asset price moves which typically run at approximately per day it is high as million per day at the height of the market volatility due to the scale and reach of the current covid19 crisis asset owners and asset managers have been impacted globally with many struggling to cope with market disruptions reduced workforces limited access to normal workplace infrastructure and continuing uncertainty to assist these clients we have focused on a number of priorities during the last few weeks first we have increased our level of client engagement and communication ensuring we better understand client needs and how we can rapidly assist them in this unique and challenging environment second we are maintaining a state of operational readiness through increased it resource capacity with strong and tested business continuity plans put into action as i mentioned earlier third we are providing a suite of liquidity solutions state street has a range of shortterm cash investment options for our clients including deposits centrallycleared repo and access to a full range of money market funds via our investment portal fundconnect global advisors also has a number of specialized cash strategies in addition our global credit finance team supports clients with overdraft capacity and committed lines of credit we also stand ready to support the broader economy state street is actively assisting our clients to tap various federal reserve programs that support the flow of liquidity and credit facilitating approximately of money market mutual fund liquidity facility or mmlf usage while also serving as the custodian and accounting administrator for the commercial paper funding facility state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 many clients appreciated that we work closely with the federal reserve to set up the mmlf and enable clients to access liquidity even before its fully operational which helped clients stabilize their funds as we look out over the longer term the evolving needs of all of our clients are at the center of our strategy to continue to be our clients essential partner and provide the technology and scale they need to grow when the current uncertainty dissipates and global macroeconomic conditions recover we believe this crisis will only accelerate the desire of clients to outsource more of their operations and partner with a fully capable fronttoback provider like state street turning to slide i am pleased by the direction and progress of our strategy as demonstrated by our strong first quarter performance relative to the prioryear period first quarter total revenue increased and on a sequential quarter basis total revenue increased first quarter eps was up yearoveryear and roe was i am pleased to report that our first quarter pretax margin improved by over percentage points to excluding notable items despite the unprecedented levels of equity market volatility during the first quarter our results benefited from the relatively stable domestic equity market averages relative to the fourth quarter of market averages were materially higher than the yearago period as a result of the dramatic global equity market selloff in late industry flows were positive in aggregate as investors move from long mutual fund positions into etfs and money market bonds at state street we saw a particularly strong recovery in us flows relative to the first quarter of while fx volatility remained at low levels for the first half of the quarter our results ultimately benefited from materially higher levels of fx volatility experienced during the latter half of the quarter and the market tumult associated with covid19 that volatility plus our multiyear innovation investments led to record fx results first quarter nii benefited from significantly higher deposit levels as clients turn to us as part of their flightto quality despite dramatic long and short end rate reductions assets under custody and administration fell quarteroverquarter to trillion as a result of lower periodend market levels we saw a healthy level of new wins during the quarter totaling billion assets yet to be installed stood at trillion at quarter end at global advisors assets under management fell quarteroverquarter to trillion as a result of lower periodend equity market levels global advisors recorded billion of total net inflows during the first quarter the highest quarter of net inflows in a year net inflows were driven by strong inflows in cash and good inflows in the institutional business as clients turned to state streets offerings in a time of turmoil after experiencing net outflows in january and february i would note that march was a particularly strong month for our etf business with our spdr suite of etf gathering more than billion in net inflows aided by the integration of charles river development we continue to see that our fronttoback alpha platform strategy provides an attractive value proposition for our clients and building on this remains a key focus for us in we signed a large sovereign wealth fund as a fronttoback client in quarter one the fronttoback state street alpha pipeline is developing and advancing well with a good mix of deal sizes functionality and scope turning to expenses first quarter total expenses were down relative to the yearago period excluding notable items we are building on the strong culture of expense management we successfully established during when we undertook significant actions to improve our operational efficiency and reduced expenses through a comprehensive firmwide expense savings program today we are more focused than ever on driving state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 productivity improvements and automation benefits as we strengthen our operating model even during this unprecedented period in addition as a result of the current environment and our decision to suspend workforce reductions we are taking additional expense actions including a hiring freeze for noncritical operational positions we also continued to very carefully manage all discretionary expenses to conclude while we cannot predict the scope and duration of the pandemic and the associated economic impact we will remain very focused on three core priorities first supporting our employees and our communities second providing service and operational excellence to our clients and third driving value for our shareholders while the markets may be unpredictable we are well prepared to navigate this volatility with a strong balance sheet capital position and proven operational capabilities we at state street remain outwardlooking globallyconnected and laserfocused on helping our clients achieve better investment outcomes for the people they serve state street has navigated through good times and bad ph times for our clients for over two centuries and this moment will be no different we stand ready to support our clients and our global workforce in any capacity we can and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone to start my review of our first quarter results id like to go to slide where you can see we reported eps of up yearoveryear on the top left panel i would call your attention to two items first our fx trading business had extraordinary quarter generating revenues of million of record volumes and increased client demand which ill spend more time discussing shortly and second we had a million provision expense with a sequential increase driven largely by the effects of the covid19 on our economic forecast on the top right panel we had million of expected pretax acquisition and restructuring charges primarily related to charles river as well as million of aftertax costs associated with the redemption of our series c preferred securities on the bottom left panel we show our quarterly results exnotable items for those of you who want to see some of the underlying trends i would also note that we were able to generate positive operating leverage in the first quarter helping to improve our first quarter pretax margin yearoveryear turning to slide periodend auca levels decreased yearonyear and quarteronquarter yearover year auca were affected by a previously announced client transition that had a de minimis effect on yearon year revenues quarteronquarter the auca decrease was mainly due to lower endofperiod equity market levels as a reminder approximately half of our auca is reported on a one month lag so some of the impact of the equity selloffs seen in march is not yet reflected here aum levels decreased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to trillion driven largely by lower end ofperiod market levels partially offset by strong net inflows over both time periods amidst the extraordinary market conditions for asset managers in the first quarter state street global advisors saw net inflows of billion largely driven by cash and institutional inflows state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 unpacking the first quarter aum trends a bit it was a tale of january and february versus march as after seeing modest net outflows in the first two months of the quarter global advisors saw strong inflows of approximately billion in march with billion in cash inflows and billion in etfs global advisors saw strong inflows of more than billion in march alone into spy our premier sp etf offering and the largest and most liquid product in its class moving to slide servicing fees were up yearonyear as the core business continued to regain momentum and down quarteronquarter on lower equity markets as ron said the investment services business saw significantly elevated client activity inflows during the quarter particularly in march and successfully navigated the activity with minimal service disruptions through this stressed environment we believe clients realize perhaps more than ever the value of our scale and capabilities during exceptionallychallenging market conditions by way of an example a number of our asset manager clients have expressed gratitude for their partnership with state street and the fact that our investment servicing business has worked tirelessly to ensure that their fund investors are able to buy sell and monitor their fund performance both accurately and timely which gives them the strong sense of confidence they deserve on the bottom right panel of this page weve again included some sales performance indicators that underline this dynamic as you can see auca wins totaled billion in the first quarter with several deals coming through the pipeline in late march we do expect to see some nearterm slowdown in sales but assets to be installed as of the first quarter period end is strong at trillion and we still expect fee pressure to remain moderated as it has in recent quarters turning to slide let me discuss the other fee revenue lines beginning with management fees first quarter revenues were up yearonyear but down quarteronquarter driven by lower average market levels and mix changes away from higher fee institutional products partially offset by positive mix changes in etfs as i mentioned earlier fx trading services were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter as the business saw record volumes and increased client demand given market volatility amidst the covid19 pandemic something ill be discussing more in more detail shortly securities finance revenues were down yearonyear as investor asset mix shifted towards lower spread fixed income assets and as hedge fund deleveraging in ph foreign markets drove down the enhanced custody demand revenues were down quarteronquarter due to similar factors finally software and processing fees were down yearonyear and quarteronquarter as you know this line includes certain business revenues such as crd software fees as well as other lumpy items such as the amortization of taxadvantaged investments certain currency translation impacts and the marktomarket adjustment on the employee longterm incentive plans these other items are worth about million negative this quarter as opposed to the usual slight positive moving to slide we wanted to provide some incremental color around the extraordinary quarter we saw on the fx trading franchise for several quarters now weve been highlighting that our fx business had been confronting historically low volatility levels but that we have been focused on expanding the client base and building share of wallet while reinvesting in our broad set of platforms this quarter positioned to support our clients needs as volumes and volatility level surge due to the covid19 pandemic spurring elevated client demand across our various fx trading venues as you can see the fx sales state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 and trading business including direct fx and custody fx saw a increase in volumes from average levels while our fx trading platforms including fx connect and currenex saw a increase in volumes over the same period on the righthand side of this page weve included the most recent euromoney rankings related to the fx business including its number one ranking for real money asset managers for two years in a row to give you a sense of the depth and breadth of this important franchise moving to slide youll see on the top left panel a fivequarter summary of crds standalone revenue and pre tax income for the first quarter crd generated standalone revenue of million which was up yearon year and down quarteronquarter i would again remind this audience the lumpiness inherent in asc revenue recognition standards and to not read across any one quarters results having said that we do expect some disruption ph in go live dates and professional services fees over the coming months as onsite activity is currently somewhat curtailed on the right panel weve again included some texture around the momentum were seeing in the business and how the integration is progressing we continue to remain confident in the revenue and cost synergy goals announced at the time of the acquisition turning to slide nii was down yearonyear but up quarteronquarter the sequential increase in nii was primarily driven by increased deposit balances and episodic marketrelated benefits of approximately million partially offset by longterm debt issuance costs average assets were up as average deposits increased quarteronquarter from fourth quarter with periodend deposits increasing quarteronquarter as we saw a wave of flighttoquality client deposits surge at the end of march particularly from asset managers we were there to support our clients weve since seen deposit levels recede somewhat in april but they still remain elevated versus levels endofperiod assets were also driven up by billion as we helped clients access the feds new money market mutual fund liquidity facility or mmlf state street facilitated just over of the mmlf volume as we asserted our leadership role in supporting our clients and the smooth functioning of market moving to slide weve included some color here on the loan portfolio as well as the companys allowance for credit losses as you know state streets loan portfolio is relatively small typically or so of average assets and generally consist of highquality and conservatively underwritten mix of fund finance leveraged loans commercial real estate and municipal loans on the right panel of this page weve included some incremental detail around the loan book and its characteristics in the current environment id note a few highlights as of first quarter approximately of the book is investmentgrade with of the onbalance sheet exposure to investmentgrade and of the off balance sheet exposures the leveraged loan portfolio of approximately billion has relatively low exposure to cyclical factors currently in focus and has an average rating of bb which is stronger than the traditional index compared to average loans grew while periodend loans grew primarily driven by elevated client overdrafts as we help clients facilitate the higher settlement of trades and fx activities during march these overdrafts have already receded in april state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 moving to the bottom left panel the total allowance for credit losses increased by million to million as we added to reserves largely related to the effects of the covid19 pandemic on the end of march economic forecast on slide weve again provided a view of expenses this quarter exnotables so that the underlying trends are readily visible our first quarter expenses excluding notable items and seasonal expenses were down yearoveryear driven by resource discipline and reengineering efforts and down quarteronquarter primarily driven by the timing of foundation funding lower travel and lower professional expenses we continue to execute on many of the investments and optimization savings initiatives detailed earlier in the year and believe that taken together these various efforts position us to navigate the extraordinary market conditions seen in recent weeks and meet our expense goals were making good progress on lowering compensation and benefits costs occupancy costs and other costs and it costs are lumpy but on track too given the potential impact of the covid19 pandemic on revenue we obviously need to begin to intervene further on expenses and now expect to take them down to for the full year this wont be easy but weve begun to accelerate our plans and well adjust as we know more first as ron mentioned earlier for the remainder of the year unless the crisis concludes earlier we will suspend most workforce reductions we also instituted a hiring freeze for noncritical positions second we see opportunities to dig deeper in noncompensation expenses such as occupancy contractors travel and other professional fees third we will be judicious about the reinvestments needed to drive growth in our business and finally we will adjust as the situation develops moving to slide you can see that we maintained strong capital and liquidity levels during the first quarter with our standardized cet1 ratio which was binding for first quarter ending at and our lcr ratio essentially flat quarteronquarter as you can see in the middle right panel our slr and tier leverage ratios ended at and respectively with the sequential decline largely driven by an influx of flighttoquality client deposits we have the room to support our client activity under both ratios especially given that the slr would have been post implementation of section on april during the quarter we returned a total of approximately million of capital to shareholders including million in share repurchases before we acting in coordination with other gsib members of the financial services forum agreed to temporarily suspend our repurchases in the second quarter we remain confident in our robust capital levels and our ongoing ability to continue to deploy our balance sheet to support our clients the financial markets and the broader economy turning to slide now weve provided a summary of our first quarter results as we mentioned earlier throughout this crisis we have been differentiating ourselves by proactively reaching out and assisting clients for these difficult times our resiliency during heightened volatility and our ability to execute record volumes without sacrificing service quality has created goodwill with our clients as we look to the future in the postcovid19 time period that said the potential length and depth of impact of the covid19 pandemic on the economy has made the operating environment uncertain this uncertainty obviously introduces a higher than usual degree of variability into our financial outlook however i would like to share our current expectations for the remainder of under a certain set of assumptions while we believe these are reasonable set of assumptions there is a broad range of possibilities regarding the potential length of the covid19 pandemic and the scale the economic impact as such the current state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 expectations we are providing today will represent one potential range of outcomes but they are not representative of the full range of potential outcomes that may actually occur so with a very difficult second quarter economic situation in front of us we assume global central banks to keep shortterm rates low and that longend rates then flowed up to about basis points by yearend we assume equity levels in the second quarter to be consistent with march averages and potentially float up in the second half of the year this would lead to average equity market levels for lower as compared to given these significant changes to the economic outlook we currently expect that fee revenue will be down to yearon year for full year looking at the component and pieces of our fee revenue let me go through each one beginning with servicing fees we expect they will be down to driven largely by lowerthanexpected market averages we continue to see good underlying health and momentum in the servicing business although there may be a slight slowdown in the sales pipeline over the near term as clients adjust to the new operating environment moving to management fees we would expect now that they will be down to yearonyear depending on equity market performance included in this outlook the zero interest rate environment introduces the likelihood of money market fund fee waivers which are highly sensitive to shortterm rates and could have a modest impact of approximately million to million on our business largely in the second half of the year our markets businesses will continue to be informed by the trading environment we expect the spike in fx trading revenues will subside with market volumes and volatility while securities finance will continue to be impacted by lower levels of leverage within software and processing fees we remain confident in the crd deal synergies however the uncertainty and the operational pressures introduced by the covid19 pandemic on the frontoffice clients is now expecting to create golive delays and slowed down professional services projects of several current crd clients as a result we now expect crd revenue to be up midsingle digit percentages yearonyear for the full year at this time we would expect software and processing fees excrd to likely be between million and million per quarter for the rest of the year absent any further significant marketrelated adjustments regarding the second quarter of on a sequential quarter basis we expect overall fee revenue to be down to depending on our much lower equity market levels with servicing fees towards the minus end of the range management fee is coming in towards the minus end of the range and considering some reversion in the trading revenues regarding nii we still expect it to be down approximately yearonyear for full year as i previously indicated in midmarch primarily driven by the impact of lower rates and the relatively strong performance in the first quarter for the second quarter we currently expect nii to be down about quarteronquarter ex episodic items driven by the full quarter impact of lower rates we expect nii to stabilize by the fourth quarter turning to expenses even during this unprecedented period we remain laserfocused on driving sustainable productivity improvements and automation benefits we expect that full year expenses exnotable items will now be down to exceeding our original goal of down as i mentioned earlier in regards to our provision expense results will be driven by updated economic forecast embedded in our new cecl models plus any specific reserves at the end of march we assumed a number of factors and a range of scenarios for our general reserve among those numerous inputs our dominant scenario had gdp of minus and full year gdp of minus had we moved to a different dominant scenario where full year gdp was state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 minus for example then we would have roughly built an additional million of reserves im simplifying of course and there are dozens of important variables but this example gives you a taste of the sensitivity of the cecl reserving process to potential economic scenarios on taxes we continue to expect that we will land within the previously provided range of to for a tax rate for the full year so some discrete items are expected to drive down that rate by about percentage points lower for second quarter and finally weve again included our previously disclosed mediumterm financial targets in our earnings presentation this morning because we believe they are the right targets however with the onset of the covid19 pandemic and the significant uncertainty around the magnitude and duration of its impacts it raises the question regarding the timing of when we might realize those targets which were set on a run rate basis for we are not changing the timing at this point but well continue to monitor the length of the covid19 anticipated impact closely going forward and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator we can now open the call for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from alex blostein with goldman sachs your line is open alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great great good morning everybody eric thanks for the updated detailed guidance i guess first question maybe around deposits so below march levels but above i guess you said fourth quarter obviously its a really wide spread there so maybe just give us a flavor for where deposits currently stayed in april sort of on average and then importantly as you guys think about the capacity to absorb any additional deposits or sustain the current levels how should we think of that with respect to your capital leverage ratios how much lower you guys would be able to take ph down eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp alex its eric let me start on the deposits and just give you a little bit of texture on the trends because i think that would help you and obviously the deposit levels moved quite a bit if you recall back in fourth quarter our deposit levels were about billion in aggregate and in january and february they were literally just spot on to those averages what started to change was the surge we saw at the beginning of march and so if we just think about the first half of march were running at about billion of average total deposits the second half of march spiked to billion and that together is what got us to a drove the higher averages for the quarter and i think you saw our endofperiod print was north of billion and we literally operated at that level of deposits for about a week at the very end of the quarter state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 in terms of today theyve been running somewhere around billion billion so still at hefty and ill call it kind of risk off levels were seeing that flighttoquality and were certainly there to support our clients we do expect them to ebb down and i think the question is whats the pace of that do we get a resurgence or not but theres a range of scenarios what i would say is the deposits now are facilitation a way for us to facilitate the needs of our clients right were there for them on overdrafts were there for them on deposits were there for them on repo were there for them on the on supporting them at the fed facilities and i think were delighted to do that as much as possible in terms of the capacity as i said in my prepared remarks i think weve got ample capacity at these levels of deposits to support our clients you see our capital ratios whether its the slr post the april change is quite high and that can thats at on a reported on the new basis were about against the level you see tier leverage we still ran well this quarter and thats against a minimum so theres certainly some range theres not unlimited range but our perspective is that if deposits stay in the at the levels that they are at today the kind of billion to billion thats quite comfortable for us and were here to do what we need to for our clients alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thats helpful detail thanks for that and then my second question is around crd so revenues about million in the first quarter thats up only i guess yearoveryear i think that business has been growing in the kind of high singledigit range and you guys were obviously hoping to increase that further so is that sort of the impact of covid19 already playing out in the first quarter results and thats really kind of the slowdown or is there something else going on and i guess as you look at the pipeline and in the fronttoback wins that you guys have been highlighting over the last couple of quarters any way to help us frame kind of the revenue backlog in that part of the business in timing to recognize it understanding that obviously that current events could move that timing up and down but just hoping to get some flavor there thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp alex let me start on that and then ill turn it over to eric were we remain very pleased with the impact that crd is having on our business the fronttoback pipeline continues to grow and its having crd as part of that toolbox if you will and as ive mentioned before in some cases we dont end up in the end with a full frontto back but we end up with a built out relationship or even a relationship that we didnt have before for example the one fronttoback win that we had this quarter that we announced this quarter it was not even an existing client of either crd or state street so from an overall enhanced state street value proposition thats working well as eric noted the reported revenues are very very sensitive to the accounting rules and the accounting treatment and we did its very sensitive to when were delivering things and if deliveries gets changed or if the contours of something gets changed it does affect the timing of reported revenues so strategically this remains a very important and integral business for us its driving a lot of new activity its driving activity into the profitable back office for us so we remain unchanged and its important to us strategically and eric can talk about the actual financial impact that you in your question state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure alex its eric so the quarterly revenues are always lumpy and ill just remind you that for a midsized client will bring in when its on an onpremise basis potentially million million in a potential installation when it goes live the smaller clients obviously are million million million and so you can see on a base of million youve got we could see big swings in growth rates positive or negative so i wouldnt read too much into that what we have done is started to think through the likely revenues for the business this year and this business in contrast to our servicing fee business has more onsite kind of work that needs to be done if theres onsite sort of codevelopment to integrate our platform with an asset managers theres professional services billings that also go with that so between the professional services billings just being slowed down with work from home and then the golive dates likely to be pushed out i dont think therell be we dont expect them to not be there but we do expect some lengthening of the of those golive dates were now looking at a revenue growth at about we said midsingle digits as opposed to the lowdouble digits that we had expected this year and we think thats mostly going to be around timing as opposed to underlying performance the pipeline in crd specifically is healthy its continued at the levels that it had been just a few months ago and the interest in securing mandates from our clients we think is actually as strong as ever alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thanks for taking the questions operator question comes from glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks quick question on the loan book so i heard you loud and clear thank you on the what the environment you underwrote to and what it could be in a worse environment in second quarter so its im trying to think through if you look at the composition in your loan book fund finance and overdrafts they dont scare me much and my gut is not much of the reserves are focused on that so is it correct to say that most of the reserving goes towards the billion leveraged loans and the billion commercial real estate and im just curious if you can contextualize a little bit more about quality of those portfolios because it what you said looks good but ph it starts adding up in terms of just reserving thats all eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp glenn its eric i think youve got the right frame of mind on the loan book this is a modestsized loan book which is of our total assets and its pretty diversified both across categories and then within categories so fund finance as you mentioned is primarily capital call finance loans with recourse to some of the largest and those premier investors in the world thats a pretty attractive business area for us and one thats grown nicely leveraged loans is an area that we obviously in this environment well spend a little extra time on ill come back talk about that in a moment and then commercial real estate overdraft munis are pretty straightforward state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 you are right to hypothesize that more than a majority of the reserves for our book is for the leveraged loan book and the reason were reasonably comfortable with this book not to say that things wont happen on an individual name here or there is that it tends to be an upmarket book average rating is about bb as opposed to the average in the index is b and literally the center of gravity is quite different weve been tracking the market prices for this book this book tends to have market prices as weve seen some change in the market to be points better than the typical than the average leveraged loan index so its performed well so far and its pretty well diversified there arent any particularly unusual exposures theres not much oil and gas in it so we think itll operate well during this time period but i guess at the end of the day its a relatively highgrade version of leveraged lending and its only billion and so we think itll still perform well and will just be a piece of the broader picture for the company glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi cool i appreciate your perspective one followup on just nii overall so keeping it at down as the thought process for the year but deposit book is a lot more im just curious a lot of the deposits come in in noninterest bearing and so well see how long they sit there but theyre going to hang out for a little while at least im just curious i know rates stink but we knew the rates were going to stink im curious why nii with a greater deposit base wouldnt be a little bit less bad eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp glenn its eric i think you said it right i wont repeat the fiveletter word you used but prevailing interest rates at the central bank are if you think of ioer as a benchmark are remarkably low right theyre at basis points so if you think about it whether we take in a deposit at or take in a deposit at theres very little spread there and so the value of the deposits while theyre there for theyre there on our balance sheet and we can lend against them we could use them to support our other books theyre transient by and large and the value is small relative to what its been if you think back to the first quarter on average first quarter deposits were worth roughly basis points just think about the cost of funds versus the ioer rate in the second quarter we expect deposits across the spectrum to be worth a fraction of that closer to basis points so its just been an order of magnitude difference and so while well have we may have a surge or higher levels of deposits well not be particularly renumerative this time around glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi i got it i appreciate it and thanks for all the guidance thanks operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs your line is open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 good morning thanks for taking my questions just wanted to dig in a little bit on your expectation on trading revenue i know you referenced eric that you expect it to subside but can you help us with magnitude how should we think about the potential decline from what you did in are you really just sort of expecting it to revert back to what we saw kind of like last year run rate or how should we calibrate and what should we watch for as the year progresses eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brennan thats a really good question and a real hard one to answer with any conviction but let me share with you how were thinking about it from a forecasting standpoint and then some of the possibilities from a forecasting standpoint our view is by may and june absent any other dramatic changes to the environment the fx volumes will normalize back to what they were precrisis and then that those levels precrisis will be what we should expect in third quarter and fourth quarter now im saying all that assuming that we have stability in equity markets bond markets global markets and thats hard to predict and obviously any further deterioration of the health situation or the economic situation is going to push us right back to where we were and were not hoping for that were hoping just for the opposite for the quieting of the enormous disruption that weve seen all that said there is a range of outcomes here not just from the pandemic and its economic impact on markets like we saw in march if we have a repeat of that in a coming month then we could see some higher volumes again but theres also a set of if you think about the rest of the year set of events right weve got brexit continuing at in some ways weve got us elections weve done a series of different elements i think political economic global world trades going to come back at some point and well have we may have tensions there and so its hard for me to really predict and so we tend to try to be careful with our forecast in fx in particular knowing that there certainly could be some upside but i think well all see it when it happens and can probably factor that in brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay great thanks for that and then circling back as a followup to one of glenns questions on the loan book thanks for the additional disclosure there the two biggest pieces are the fund finance and overdraft can you talk about any exposures that you might have in the fund finance book to mortgage reits what in that book makes you or your risk managers nervous when they go to sleep at night and obviously its not when we go into a market like this its not necessarily the stuff you always think that you need to worry about sometimes you get hit by surprise so how can we how is it that you think about that book how is it that you riskmanage and how do you ensure that we dont end up in a situation similar to what we had to offcycle where what we thought was good like with the liquidity backstops for the assetbacked commercial paper conduits all of a sudden have become assets that end up coming back on the balance sheet and big headache to deal with eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah brennan its eric let me give you a little bit of texture perhaps on whats included in the billion of fund finance and how we think about it and you can imagine over the last month between finance and our risk state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 organization and our business teams weve spent extra time in heightening our oversight and monitoring but let me describe for you what we have there and kind of how we think about the each of those books and maintaining the quality that we like so within fund finance the largest piece is capital call financing thats literally lines to some of the premier investors around the world and thats done on a thats been allocated on a fundbyfund basis but the work that goes on behind the scenes is that each of those funds has a set of investors behind it and what we need to do is maintain a diversified group of liens to those investors and we want to avoid all concentrations so theres a lot of work that gets done as we grow that book to make sure that there arent any unknown concentrations or the concentrations are all within limits on a literally an investorbyinvestor basis because thats where we have recourse so thats the primary approach on the capital call financing the next piece within fund finance is the act liquidity funds that these are the funds that can have a certain amount of leverage theyre very well described i think in the act rules and they have limits on the amount of leverage they can and there the monitoring is whats the asset pool its effectively a version of margin lending whats the underlying asset pool what are the line sizes how do we constrain those appropriately and have our limit structures and then there is literally the daily monitoring of that leverage and that margining but thats pretty straightforward in some sense but just like you say you never say never and so theres extra oversight in these volatile times to measure and to monitor the underlying collateral literally on a daily basis as youd expect and then the smallest piece within fund finance is the bdcs its just over billion it tends to be bdcs with bbb pools of underlying loans and so there its about diversification of the bdcs they tend to be from some of the most premier alternative asset manager providers right some of our largest clients because thats who were trying to support there and there its about a set of size limits and ongoing monitoring so thats maybe a little bit of texture i think like i guess the frame of reference id give you is each of these is a little different and each of these has a different level of monitoring and the process now i think like any bank but ours is kind of simpler and more vanilla than most banks is to see if there are any if margin changes more than expected ph occasionally you get questions around the possibility of adjusting covenants and thats a that quickly escalates so that we have to make sure that how we react to those proactively and consciously and sometimes we grant those and sometimes we grant those and actually ask the borrower to reduce their leverage or their or our exposure to their exposure to our exposure to them and so theres a id say theres a very natural set of actions that we use both on a monitoring and intervention basis on an ongoing basis but let me pause there with at least that texture brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thanks thats great additional color appreciate it operator comes from ken usdin with jefferies your line is open state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning ron and eric i was wondering if you could expand upon your comments that you already gave on crd talking about that maybe the cycle is a little bit slower there just in terms of your regular way servicing conversations that youre having with clients giving the changes and how were all working how are those conversations going are does the how do you approach sales cycles and moving forward with engagements that youve already been in process with and sourcing new business thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah ken the i mean the level of engagement remains high and has continued to be high even during this last month five weeks of with almost everybody in the world working from home and in fact a new very large situation developed right in the middle of all this that weve started to work through i would say that the underlying themes remain the same with this idea of improving and lowering costs of the asset managers or the asset owners cost structure of improving their operations trying to do an outsource of things that are not really critical to their investments but are critical to achieving better outcomes both for their clients and for themselves i think whats changed and whats been added to the consideration now is all of the operational stress thats been applied to these managers since then many many managers were not prepared for work from home and they certainly werent prepared for a global work from home so we see that if anything providing another catalyst to these kinds of what we consider fundamental enterprise outsourcing and you can see that its playing through even in our new business the line that we focus on is new business plus business to be installed and as you can see the business to the installed number remains quite high and that reflects the fact that the business increasingly is less about just a single product and much more about multiple initiatives multiple kinds of offerings that we have underway for our clients and we think see this continuing we see that the need and desire to outsource at the extreme youll have clients that just have antiquated systems or operations that need fundamental upgrading at the other extreme and weve experienced this too highly successful managers and asset owners that are saying we can do this but its not a good use of our time and we want to be able to scale and we want to work with a partner that could be there for us so we see this whole trend continuing and probably accelerating ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp ken this is eric ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc yes state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp id just add that were also obviously these the revenues this year are based on the bookings and the wins from last year by and large right think about the installation process and so far i think weve been pleased with the continued implementation our onboarding team has been active through the end of march onboarding some sizable clients on schedule april weve were halfway through april and have visibility the rest of the month and are not seeing any unusual or major delays and so for the time being and i think if we can get through the if we could get through march and april the thatll bode well but the previously one business tends to be installed on schedule because it needs to be right youve got the previous provider who needs to come off youve got a lot of preparation thats been done and so so far weve actually seen good progress or good continuity on the onboarding side which is important because thats when the revenues tend to begin to be accrued ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood thank you and the followup just on the buyback side you guys are part of the financial services forum agreement to stop buybacks through the second quarter but obviously not being a credits as credit sensitive of an institution and just looking at the results this quarter it would seem that you guys would have capacity to continue a buyback regardless of what the credit environment turned into im just wondering just your thoughts on whether or not if the rest of the forum has to decides to continue to stop buybacks for longer than the second quarter would you have to be a part of that or could you make start making your own decisions based on your own capacity to do so thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah ken look we should be clear we make our own decisions on this we are part of the forum we talked to the forum and we considered it actually a very good move to make to instill confidence in the system and to remember this happened at a time where people were questioning whether or not banks would be there and we i felt it was not going to be useful for us to not be part of this and to have more time spent on gee why are there one or two outliers as opposed to the banks are committed to being there during the crisis but we make our own decisions youre right we are very different and our results will play out differently than credit intensive banks so another good news is that with the new rules that are being implemented capital planning can be much more dynamic than it has been in the past and well take advantage of that as the situation plays out i mean the realities are that its still highly uncertain you heard that and the environment is highly uncertain you heard that reflected in the assumptions upon which we based our guidance to you one could argue that weve been very conservative but one could argue also that the situation could get a lot worse than what our what we put out there as a point estimate and thats exactly what weve done weve given a point estimate within a wide range of potential outcomes the market level one is the biggest one and there the assumption is is that average markets will be what they were at period end march i mean thats were already much the spot levels are higher than that so we really dont know here which is why going back to your question on capital if this all plays out as we see we believe well be in a position to distribute capital but we think its wise to be able to make that decision dynamically quartertoquarter state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc understood if i can just ask a quick followup eric just on one of your prepared remarks the million to million of the potential fee waivers thats not dissimilar to what happened prior cycle is that just like an aggregate number that like what could happen on a full year basis as opposed to a quarterly basis eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp ken its eric yeah thats for the rest of the year primarily in the second quarter i gave you a large range because its also highly dependent on short rates right if the overnight repo rates are at or basis points or or or or you literally you could go from to the to what could be the upper end of that range but that would have been for the rest of the year and it would be primarily in the second half ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah operator your next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc i just wanted to dig in a little bit on the expense side i know you indicated that youre looking at everything and now were anticipating that youre going to be able to bring expenses down to more than the prior commentary around down and i just wanted to understand where in an environment where youre not doing any redundancies obviously this year could you speak to where theres some opportunity set to dig into that eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah betsy its eric the opportunity set is broad and its a set of initiatives that weve had underway and in the spirit of when things are tougher youve got to act more dramatically is i think the theme that id share with you so if you think about the different areas of our expense base the compensation and benefits line wont be as much of a tailwind as weve i think made a very conscious and appropriate choice on protecting our people state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 but if you think about the expense base thats only about half of the expense base and even within the compensation and benefits lines for example there are contractors there are significant amount of contractors that we employ and if you think about it if were going to end up with a larger employee workforce than we expected right contractors could be an area that we where we adjust so its that kind of action occupancy is another natural one whoever thought that you could run a company at a or work from home but it does give us a real perspective as we have lease rollovers or where we might have been planning on taking additional leases and theres always a rolling set of either potential exits or adds that youre doing as you load balance you can imagine weve got lease adds on a complete moratorium and where we had rollovers you can imagine were now starting to move in the opposite direction and say hey why cant i let this space go and when employees do come back i want all my employees back but we clearly have more flexibility than we ever would so thats another example third one might be around all the other expenses in technology theres software theres hardware purchases et cetera while our teams are spending time on supporting clients in literally hourly daily basis its also a natural time for us to slow some of our purchases of capital equipment or software doesnt say we wont come back and naturally think about spending some of that in the future but it does mean that we can slow some of those purchases because its weve shifted some of our time and energy to more immediate situations as opposed to some of the mediumterm investments so i think thats the other one which is the kind of the reinvestment will naturally slow to some extent and if you remember the chart we did at the fourth quarter earnings call in january we showed expenses down now were saying down to but within that there was a or increase in investments of expenses due to investments and to decrease going in the other direction and so part of what were doing is also i think being more disciplined about those reinvestments that were doing now and pacing them betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and that was interesting too on the occupancy side because while you might have where people come back to work over time you might not be as densely organized as you have been in the past so thats one of the reasons why i was kind of interested in can you actually reduce occupancy or not but definitely makes sense on the lease rollovers and additional leases at least for the nearterm ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp betsy what i would add betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc are you still yeah go ahead ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp what i would add to erics comments are a couple we have had underway as you would know a lot of work on process redesign and automation and that work is not stopping right how we how and when we realize the benefits of it may change and be delayed but the work is not stopping and so and if anything were redoubling our efforts there so i would just note that weve got this moratorium and we absolutely think its the right thing to state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 do but our work both in it and in operations and then how we connect with our clients that remains were working full speed on that the other point id make on the leases is that i agree with your point that we probably wont be as dense for a long period of time at least until theres a vaccine but the i think its surprised everybody not just at state street but elsewhere how effective one can be in work from home and i would have to believe that over the medium and long term that youll see us having less space than we do today betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it are you still going to be moving your headquarters ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp we are and that was always a natural financial benefit to us so were thats still underway for the end of betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay thanks so much operator your next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank your line is open brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning guys thanks for taking my question maybe just focus on the average balance sheet in terms of the nonus deposit rates of negative basis points if you could just go into that dynamic whats driving that i think that there may or might be fx swap expense against that and then also just a commentary on the driver of the episodic or the net interest income that you described as episodic in the quarter and then also you mentioned basis points on deposits in a prior comment i missed what that deposit level was linked to eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure let me brian let me take those in order so on the average balance sheet youre right the nonus deposit costs fell they were minus basis points from minus basis points its literally the effect of the fx swaps which are diagrammed out in the footnote on that page i think its page of the financial addendum and as well as some modest reductions in interest rates in foreign jurisdictions right some of the european and asian central banks dropped rates and so that will flow through that line as well in terms of the nii that we reported in first quarter we did note that there was about million of higherthan usual nii separate from the deposits the deposits for welcome and additive nii but away from deposits and loans and investments the million was really split into two about half of that was literally the hedging effect that goes through we hedge either debt or the rate coupons on some of the loans and that creates a markto market as youve got changes in the debt market so its worth about half of the million state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 and the other half was actually some good positioning that we took in the quarter with the influx of deposits and in particular dollar deposits we were dollar rich dollars were quite valuable and so the treasury team did quite well to invest those in either yen or euros their kind of one and twoday overnight basis swaps and that was remunerative to us and at the same time it was helpful to either clients or counterparties in those foreign jurisdictions who were dollarpoor and needed some of the access to the dollars that we could provide so those were the two components of the million finally on the deposits what i did say to one of the earlier questions is the value of deposits has changed significantly in pl terms i mean the value of deposits is always high on a balance sheet basis and not that we needed more deposits but we were happy to accept them from our clients the point that i made is that the level of deposits in the first quarter and then last year had a large impact to nii because the kind of typical deposit let me kind of use that in very broad swath might have been worth basis points think about the cost we would have paid on average for the deposits say in the us versus the ioer rate at the fed that would be kind of a simple approximation if you fast forward in say in april or in second quarter how valuable is that same mix of us deposits its much less its closer to basis points and why is that its because our cost of funds the cost of those deposits to us could be or basis points or or but we reinvest them at ioer rates of basis points and so what you effectively had is a very large change in the value of incremental deposits between kind of the pre the fed moves and then post fed moves that was the point i was making so deposits will matter a little bit to nii going forward but not nearly as much as they would have mattered in the past brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc right thats very clear okay thank you and then just on the crd commentary on the delay obviously that makes sense given whats going on at work from home can you comment on whether you think youre still on track for the revenue and expense synergies and the net benefit of million to million on ebit on the revenue side net of investment and i think million to million on the cost side whether you think that sort of gets also pushed out with delay in implementations and then the timing of the trillion left to install in the servicing business is that also delayed by covid19 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brian let me take those two different but related questions on charles river were still quite confident in the revenue and expense synergies the expense ones are something we do as a matter of course and you can imagine well actually try to accelerate those a bit but those are on track and then on the revenue side a good bit of those synergies are actually coming from some of our trading businesses as we plug in our fx and securities lending and other market activities into charles river and thats on schedule and moving along at pace so were currently confident in our delivering on the synergies for charles river on the servicing side as i mentioned the client onboarding has stayed on track in march and april and so as we think about the timeline of that trillion to be installed for the servicing business we think that will play out during the year if you recall ive talked about those wins and some of those wins are fast to install say something like custody and others where its a mix of custody and accounting and perhaps some of the offshore crossborder products those tend to take longer when you add middle office it takes even longer but those are all part of the standard course of business and we dont at this point see a slowdown in the implementation on onboarding rates and so far our clients are eager to move forward because in some ways remember that state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 business that we won came with some fee adjustments clients want to conclude on those and so they need to implement the service and so those are now because theyre paired up i think well stay on track on both sides brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thanks thats great color thanks very much for all the detail operator your next question comes from mike carrier with bank of america your line is open michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc all right thanks good morning just two quick followups first on crd just in terms of the midsingle digits versus the double digits i just want to make sure from an understanding like if we get to and lets say there are medical treatments and most people are back to work would you expect like a pretty significant acceleration or from like a head count or what people can actually accomplish would you just go back to sort of the lowdouble digits like would you get that acceleration or is it just not possible just given like the timing of the implementation and how much like people power that takes ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah let me begin on that i think that as eric noted we stand by the synergies that we laid out there and i think whats happening here is that the pipeline that charles river would have seen versus the pipeline that its seeing now is quite different it tends to be larger more complicated and sophisticated clients it tends to be part of a multiproduct installation so what youre seeing is its just taking longer to install and therefore for the part of the deal that gets credited to charles river its just taking longer for that to happen and in fact youre seeing now in the current installations two very large installations underway one of which has been out there since before we acquired the firm and thats changed over time and thats delayed the revenue recognition so over the medium and long term do we believe that this business can grow faster under us than it was prior to us yes we do michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc okay and then just on fx the comments that you made makes sense given some of the investments that you guys have made in the platform when youve seen the uptick in volatility had there been any kind of increases in like clients that the number of products that could be sustainable if we continue to get some level of volatility obviously well get a moderation but maybe have you seen anything in terms of traction on that platform that the new level you know you could be at a higher pace ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah market share is a hard thing to measure in this business because nobody uses just one provider but we have invested heavily over the past couple of years in this era of low volatility to build market share to show and demonstrate to clients the capabilities that we have and that really helped when it came time and the team came through and the transactions occurred really difficult roles period end roles that were going to be hard to execute got done and our clients remember that so we think this market share that weve built will last for us as eric state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 noted what we saw was just immense volatility and immense kind of move from riskon to riskoff assets including moves out of certain base currencies to others and all crisisdriven so if we see that again then theres lots of bad news elsewhere will we likely see or could we likely see is maybe a better way to describe it volumes higher than what weve seen in the timeframe possibly right because i think well be in an era of i mean almost any forecast one would have to believe has some level of heightened risk the other thing too is i mean we saw our giant rotation out particularly of emerging markets i mean at some point therell be a rotation back and that tends to be also beneficial to us too so again we gave you an estimate and we tried to be conservative here recognizing the range of or the amount of uncertainty and therefore the range of possible assumptions but there certainly is a case where one could expect to see not sustained levels at least in our forecast that we saw in q1 but levels above what weve seen in the prior to quarters michael carrier q analyst bofa securities inc thanks operator your next question comes from brian kleinhanzl with kbw your line is open brian kleinhanzl q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah good morning yeah just one question maybe kind of an update on where were at in april if you look at the balance sheet you had the overdraft that came in at the end of the quarter you also had the billion of investment securities from the mmlf that were on the balance sheet and then maybe could you just give an update on where those stand do those just roll back off now that things have kind of stabilized and also same with the money market fund flows i mean what are you seeing thus far in april thanks eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp brian its eric the endofperiod balance sheet is a good starting point to followup on that question and heres how i would frame it i think the mmlf balance is were at about billion at the end of the reporting period on march and theyve been in that range i mean plusminus a few billion dollars weve been in that range for the first two weeks of april and then deposits which had spiked to just over billion are probably closer to billion to billion so its really the reduction in deposits that are adjusting the balance sheet down by call it billion end of period relative to what we saw there will be a few other smaller movements overdrafts have continued to float back down to more traditional levels the mark on the forwards and the fx books have started to revert so theres a few billion here or there and a couple of other areas but the biggest one is the guidance i gave on deposits coming down by about billion from the endofperiod levels will be the biggest change so far that we see operator your next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 hi hey ron can you talk about the tradeoff of basically offense versus defense the tone that youre sending to the company when i think of offense i think of longterm market share helping out the government being part of the solution like youre doing with the money market maybe more help as the fed expands its balance sheet gaining share versus smaller competitors by doing a little bit extra when i think of defense i think of shortterm hunker down live to fight another day like what youre doing more for employees youre not buying back stock and then maybe even for clients if theyre not making you as much money still kind of living with that so how do you think about that tradeoff in this unusual world ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp well its mike it cant be one or the other but i would say that particularly since we feel like over the last year yearandahalf weve gotten a very good handle on our expenses not just from an expense level but how we manage those expense levels how we manage for productivity i think you will find that our tone and our actions are mostly around offense certainly as it relates to clients we have had unparalleled levels of client communication and client engagement and if anything the time in working from home caused people to redouble and retriple their efforts to be there to support clients and that will pay off for years to come so we think that in the short term we have to be protecting our employees both physically and mentally and we think weve taken the appropriate actions there but we dont think weve taken them at the expense of any kind of longterm opportunity creation for ourselves and our shareholders mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and as it relates to clients you mentioned a rotation out of emerging markets historically an emerging markets equities fund would generate higher custody fees than a plain vanilla bond portfolio so if people move out of highrisk into lowerrisk wouldnt that hurt fees to assets under custody and maybe youre doing a little bit extra for clients even though youre not getting paid as much ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah well my reference to emerging markets i mean that rotation was happening and just if anything has played itself out even further over the last month i dont believe that that makes sense over certainly doesnt make sense over the long term it wont make sense over the medium term and we would expect to see as the situation stabilizes and investors start looking at relative valuations around the world theyll see just the value opportunities in emerging markets so i wasnt suggesting even a greater rotation the rotations largely happen now the question is when will the rotation back occur mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc understand in terms of if theres risk off does that mean clients go to more plain vanilla portfolios where you get less fees state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah well certainly in the short term thats what theyre doing right i mean its youre seeing a giant push into cash but at the levels that investors are getting paid and the amount of stimulus first monetary and increasingly fiscal thats going to be put in again one persons opinion i think that the more likely longterm trend is for risk assets particularly equities to continue to provide superior returns and in a period of uncertainty like this which is not only uncertain but previously unknown youre not going to see as much in the short term until there is more certainty but all of the ingredients are in place lots of monetary stimulus lots of cash in the system low interest rates to see a return to risk on at the appropriate time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then one more followup eric or ron just look do you anything you can glean from whats happening in asia or outside the us that gives you extra insight to the us especially like what percentage of your workforce is in the office in asia at this point versus the us or any other trends or like i said insight since you are in more than one country obviously ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp yeah so and probably china our hangzhou operation is a great example of what we can expect worldwide we were given the goahead to start returning employees there back in the middle of march and were now back up to about between and back to work and weve actually metered that as weve noted earlier we have not densified the office as much weve got testing facilities on the way in initially people were wearing masks and now youre seeing a much more normal working environment and i think that will stay for as long as theres not another outbreak what were seeing elsewhere in asia is not quite as fast a return to work but youre also seeing guidelines kind of ebb and flow as you see periodic outbreaks and i think thats probably what were going to live with around the world i dont think this will be a straightline recovery in terms of whether its back to work or back to gatherings i think that there will be periodic outbreaks businesses and governments will need to respond to those theyre not going to respond in the same way if the lessons from singapore and hong kong are anything theyll be very targeted guidelines for example in singapore they just recently limited restaurants again but they didnt send everybody home from work so i think thats what you can expect to see if you will a steady recovery back over time but with some bumpiness along the way as there are outbreaks until we get first to testing and then to a widespread availability of vaccines mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great and lastly how many employees do you have in china because thats a fascinating statistic to are back to work in china state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp in china the vast majority of them in our hangzhou facility mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi guys good morning so eric i wanted to ask a question on the securities portfolio just given your heavier mix towards fixed versus floating i think in the 10k you cited a longer duration of around years for your book relative to where some of your peers are managing it im just wondering what causes the nii to stabilize by year end just given some of the reinvestment headwinds could persist and maybe if you could frame what reinvestment yield or level youre assuming versus the basis points that the securities book is earning today eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp steven its eric there are a number of factors that youve got to assemble to really predict the path of nii and in our 10k we tend to assemble them all together and the securities portfolio is just one of them if you think about the average duration of our balance sheet you are right the securities portfolio has an average duration of years but the rest of the asset side of the balance sheet is actually much more floating rate and remember the securities portfolio is ex the mmlf to keep it simple is call it just shy of billion out of a billion typical balance sheet so its an important piece but its not the only piece the effect of that is that the average duration of the asset side of the balance sheet that we have is about years so about half of the duration of the securities portfolio and that shorter net asset or the lower duration of the total asset side of the balance sheet is what creates a repricing that tends to be a little faster than you would have expected by just thinking about the investment portfolio so as weve played that through our models and obviously in our models there are a lot of different factors but those two are important ones you see a step down from first quarter to second quarter thats significant and i gave an indication of that we see another step down but not as large in percentage terms from second quarter to third quarter and then starting in the fourth quarter you see a fair amount of stability between fourth quarter and then our guesstimates of what we might see in the first and second quarter of and part of that is that youve got the interest rate effects playing out then youve got some natural balance sheet growth which creates a bit of a tailwind and so once we get through the bulk of the interest rate effect which happens in the first couple of quarters the headwinds and the tailwinds tend to roughly even out which is why we think well see some stability from the fourth quarter onwards state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats it thanks for that eric really helpful color the one piece i was hoping you could clarify is what reinvestment yield or level are you assuming on the securities book eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah im trying to think about a good way to describe that to you so our investment portfolio yield right now is about just over and that floated down just marginally but thats because rates fell quickly towards the very end of the quarter if i think about reinvestment levels in the portfolio i guess we could talk about new investments whats rolling off theres a lot of ins and outs of that maybe the better way to describe it is that the average yield on the portfolio is about on average for first quarter if we start to think about whats the average yield in second quarter and maybe in the third and fourth quarter were closer to about kind of roughly if i eyeball what the averages will look like and that will be driven by the new roles being added and the old roles coming off but thats probably a good rough amount a good rough estimate for you steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that eric and just one more followup if i may lots of helpful detail in the loan mix and composition now the provision that you reported was admittedly a bit lighter than peers if we compare your reserve levels versus dfast losses on that screen or on that basis you look a bit under reserved but if you look at your companyrun stress tests it looks like youre bang in line with the rest of the peer group and so just given that a lot of investors are using the fed stress test and the dfast as a framework for forecasting provisions i was hoping you could clarify or speak to some of the differences in what the fed assumes versus what you guys assume for your company run and why youre comfortable modeling lower losses relative to the fed eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp steve its eric so a couple of perspectives there some of which you touched on and others which ill add i think first we added to our reserve about million so the reserve was up about a third and i think when i scanned across peers you saw reserve increases of anywhere between and on corporate books so i think we made the right upward adjustment just given what we knew at the time and what our forecasts were as of march in terms of comparing the reserves to say the ccar losses either the fed model or our own models or to loans i think thats where the mix of the loan book is in and all those ratios are incredibly sensitive to the mix of the loan book if you think about it our fund finance loans and one could go back to the last crisis the crisis performed particularly well and so weve got to factor that into our reserving and what i would say is the reason the fed both does its math on estimated losses under ccar and then asks us to do our math is not just to say hey there will be a natural bid ask but it is to reflect the different nature of the books if you think about it i think the fed spent an enormous amount of time as you would expect on what is the typical midmarket corporate lending book going to result in in terms of losses or whats the typical credit card book and how will it perform under stress state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 i would think that while they have extensive modelers they probably spend a little less time on our fund finance to capital call line book just because its small and its not widespread around the industry so i would at least say that in our particular circumstances the companyrun stress tests that youve been referencing are in our mind is a good indicator of credit under stress in may but ill be sensitive to it because all models are informative maybe a bit more indicative than some of the fed models just because they tend to be much more averaged across more kind of a noncustodial set of banks steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks so much for the helpful color appreciate it operator your next question comes from rob wildhack with autonomous research your line is open robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys in the slide deck you called out some pricing headwinds contributing to both sequential and yearoveryear declines in the servicing fee line can you just expand on what youre seeing there and then more broadly what are your thoughts on pricing from here given the shift in the macro thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp why dont i begin eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure bob its ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp why dont i start eric in terms of ill start with your second question on the second part of your question eric will answer the first we have spent a lot of time with our clients remember weve got a fairly concentrated book of business our largest clients constitute a big portion of the total and were through 80plus of that weve gotten term out of a lot of them but more importantly weve just learned how to do this better than we have in the past so while for sure our clients will be under their own sets of stress as a result of this we are not anticipating a heightened level of price compression part of it is that its a given if you think about the way that were remunerated in a client relationship a part of that is nii and they can see as well as we can that that is as a source of return is going away so we think its reasonable to assume that the pricing as weve said before will pricing pressure is abating that it will continue to abate and level out at a normal level which is its not going to go away but it will be a normal level as opposed to what its been over the past couple of years and nothing that weve seen this year suggests anything different on that state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah rob its eric id just add that the pricing has been a natural part of this custody business for decades and what were doing in the disclosure on the slide deck is literally given you for servicing fees whats the very transparent roll forward and net new business flows and client activity which were up this quarter actually was a tailwind market appreciation and depreciation and pricing going the other way so its just part of our natural disclosure now and on a goingforward basis but as ron said we expected a certain amount of pricing to come through during this year at that kind of level so down from the headwinds we saw last year and everything were seeing suggests that were on track for that currently and it will moderate from last years levels so in line with what we currently expect robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thank you guys operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning ron good morning eric ronald philip ohanley a chairman chief executive officer state street corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric thank you for the detail on the loan portfolio very helpful as another question on that leveraged loan portion of the portfolio are you primarily a participant in those loans the syndicated type loans or are you the lead and then second are they all subject to the shared national credit exam process eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric i think the answer is an easy yes to both of those so we tend to be a participant in a set of syndicates with the other large banks and work closely with them well occasionally but we tend to be a participant at the table and we tend to operate within syndicates of sister banks that we feel when they lead are very thoughtful about credit and credit appetite because its not just a particular loan but its the covenants its the terms and conditions that matter and so the choice we make of which syndicates to join and which lead banks to partner up with is important so but that tends to be our position to participate and then absolutely we participate in the snc reviews and snc tests and so thats a way for us to i think for the industry and for our supervisors to make sure that we evaluate credit consistently i think whats helpful about leveraged loans is theyre also traded in the marketplace so theres both an external market benchmark and they are external ratings state street corp stt corrected transcript q1 earnings call 17apr2020 and oftentimes there are prices but theres also the snc review process we participate in that and so we feel like weve got a very good read into the quality and health of our book and as i mentioned it tends to be double the average book with actually some bbbs and higher and just very few under the bb level gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just a quick followup you gave us good information on the positive flow and what you saw at the end of the quarter and whats happened since then can you share with us what were the customers or who are the customers that were the primary drivers of that deposit inflow and then are they the same customers that are withdrawing now or is it a different group that are actually withdrawing the deposits eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure gerard let me give you a little bit of texture because if you think about our client base its asset managers asset owners alternative providers insurance a wide breadth i think what we saw is that while they all tended to become more liquid and go to cash and so we had some increase in deposits from across all those segments the single largest area came from our asset managers and sometimes it was the asset managers who were running money funds and they were derisking those funds and then leaving the deposits with us and sometimes it was just the asset managers running various funds that we custody for equity funds bond funds us international et cetera where they were derisking within those funds and shifting to cash and so those are probably the two different factors within asset management asset manager complexes and its that cash thats come back and sits on our balance sheet and so i think part of what were watching for is how quickly does that cash get reinvested versus how liquid do those managers want to stay whether its the kind of money market complexes they run and so sometimes they stay in cash as opposed to even buying short and mediumterm treasuries or how risk off some of the long players or even the alternative providers want to be but those are the factors and it was primarily around asset managers and as i said in my prepared remarks were delighted to make our balance sheet available to them both on the as they have these flight to quality deposits or even operationally as we support them with overdrafts because both of those are important parts of our business in addition even to some of the offbalance sheet activity the sponsored repo and other facilitation that we provided was yet another source of liquidity as well gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you operator that concludes the questions at this time ill turn the call back over to ron ohanley for closing remarks ronald philip ohanley chairman chief executive officer state street corp thank you operator and thanks to all on the call thanks for joining us operator this concludes todays conference call you may now disconnect state street corp stt corrected
