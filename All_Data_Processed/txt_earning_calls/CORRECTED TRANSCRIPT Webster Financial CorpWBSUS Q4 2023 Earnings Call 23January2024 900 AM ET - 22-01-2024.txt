for the banking industry this performance illustrates the strength of our franchise including a uniquely diverse and sound funding base highly efficient operating model and focus on noncommoditized businesses we grew our adjusted eps to from in the prior year generating record eps for webster we reached a record tangible book value per share in the fourth quarter as well our return on assets was our return on tangible common equity was and we ended the year with a efficiency ratio in addition to our strong financial performance we realized several meaningful strategic accomplishments we capably executed our core technology conversion and have completed substantially all of the work on our merger integration we closed the interlink acquisition and we announced the acquisition of ametros we grew core deposits through a highly competitive environment in the banking industry illustrating our funding advantage and webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 the strength of our relationshiporiented business model we also refined our mix of businesses emphasizing and building those where we have a strategic advantage and the most promising riskreward characteristics on the next slide our fourth quarter financial results remain solid on an adjusted basis we produced a return on tangible common equity of and a return on assets of nearly our adjusted eps was a we grew our deposits and loans each by roughly with loan growth focused in strategic commercial categories we continue to exhibit solid expense control with an efficiency ratio of our common equity tier capital and tangible common equity remain strong at and respectively our strong starting point and internal capital generation capability will provide us with a significant amount of operating flexibility over the long term the timing of some of our fourth quarter accomplishments including our solid loan growth were backloaded resulting in a periodend loan and securities balance that were more than billion higher than the average balances our overall loan growth coupled with a robust pipeline should provide us with a tailwind as we head into the following slide illustrates our funding diversity which highlights one of our key strategic advantages we are confident that we are adding another unique funding vertical with our acquisition of ametros which we announced at the end of last year and expect to close shortly we provide some detail on the business on the following slide ametros is a particularly unique and exciting opportunity for webster as it provides lowcost fastgrowing deposits which add significant fee income to describe the business in brief ametros administers recipients funds from medical claims settlement via a proprietary technology platform and service teams a large majority of the claims ametros administered are structured as annuities whereby funds are replenished over the life of the recipient as of today there are over billion of contracted deposit inflows under this construct given this replenishment feature the average deposit duration exceeds years the collection and retention of these funds is further enhanced by the valueadded services ametros provides including payment management access to discounted medical services and government reporting they have an ardent customer base as evidenced by a net promoter score of and are by far the market leader among professional administrators we expect deposits will grow at a cagr over the ensuing five years our projected growth trajectory assumes the growth of members and no changes to ametros existing business constitution including the addition of new relationships new business verticals medical inflation or synergies with websters existing businesses for all of these we see varying degrees of opportunity we anticipate the transaction will be modestly accretive to earnings and accretive to earnings we look forward to officially welcoming our new colleagues in the near future our overall credit profile and key credit metrics remain fairly unchanged from prior quarter as we continue to proactively manage our credit exposures across the bank glenn will provide more detail in his comments on the next slide ill quickly touch on the standard overview of our office cre portfolio we continue to make solid progress on reducing the size of this portfolio which is down another million this quarter the majority of the reduction came from either payoffs or properties being repositioned overall performance of the portfolio continues to be relatively consistent with solid support underlying the credits we did see a tickup in classified webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 loans to from last quarter but delinquencies and nonaccruals are nonexistent given we were getting to a much smaller absolute balance we will likely move this slide to the appendix in future quarters with that ill turn it over to glenn to cover our financials in more detail glenn i macinnes chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp thanks john and good morning everyone ill start on slide with our gaap and adjusted earnings for the fourth quarter we reported gaap net income to common shareholders of million with earnings per share of on an adjusted basis we reported net income to common shareholders of million an eps of the largest component of the adjustments were million fdic special assessment million in mergerrelated expense and securities repositioning loss of million next ill review balance sheet trends beginning on slide total assets were billion at periodend of billion from the third quarter our securities balances were up billion from the third quarter million of the increase was attributed to value appreciation of our afs portfolio while the remaining million reflects incremental action we took to reduce our asset sensitivity much of the securities growth occurred late in the fourth quarter with the associated net interest income benefit to be realized in the first quarter as i noted a moment ago we also repositioned roughly million of our securities portfolio with less than oneyear earnback this should result in the benefit of basis points to our net interest margin in the first quarter loans were up million driven by commercial categories the majority of the growth occurred late in the quarter resulting in a periodend balance that was higher than average by million deposits grew by million in the quarter the net result of seasonal declines in public sector funds offset by growth in cds interlink and interestbearing checking our loantodeposit ratio was flat to last quarter our capital levels remain strong common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was tangible book value increased to per share or just under quarteroverquarter reflecting earnings and the improvement in aoci in a steady interest rate environment we anticipate million of unrealized security losses would accrete back into capital annually loan trends are highlighted on slide in total loans are up roughly million or on a linkedquarter basis the commercial bank continues to drive loan trends where we grew the ci and commercial real estate portfolios on net much of the growth was in lowrisk loweryielding portfolios growth in ci was principally in fund banking and public sector finance as well as business banking commercial real estate growth was in stronger riskrated portfolios including multifamily notably we ran off remaining balances in mortgage warehouse the yield on the loan portfolio increased basis points and floating and periodic loans were of total loans at quarterend we provide additional detail on deposits on slide with total deposits up million from prior quarter or we saw growth in all major deposit product categories with the exception of demand and money market accounts where seasonality in public funds drove declines our total deposit costs were up basis points to basis points for a cumulative cycletodate total deposit beta of webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 on slide we rolled forward our deposit beta assumptions to incorporate the first quarter during which we anticipate our beta to reach moving to slide we highlight our reported to adjusted income statement compared to our adjusted earnings for the prior period overall adjusted net income was down million relative to prior quarter net interest income was down million as anticipated balance sheet growth was achieved later in the quarter and we continue to run off nonstrategic loans adjusted noninterest income was down million largely driven by a noncash swing in our modeled credit valuation adjustment on customer derivatives partially offsetting these trends expenses were down million and the provision was down million we also benefited from a lower tax rate this quarter down from in the third quarter as a result of state and local trueups our efficiency ratio was on slide we highlight net interest income which declined million linked quarter this was driven by a later thananticipated growth in our earning assets in addition to runoff of nonstrategic portfolios net interest margin decreased basis points from the prior quarter to as a result of the timing of our fourth quarter earning asset growth and forecasted originations in q1 we expect to grow both net interest income and nim into the first quarter our yield on earning assets increased basis points over prior quarter the pace of deposit pricing moderated to basis points while the cost of total interestbearing liabilities was up basis points the increase is driven by a periodic change in deposit mix primarily due to the seasonal decline in public funds with offsetting growth coming in higheryielding deposit categories and wholesale funding on slide we highlight noninterest income which was down million to prior quarter on an adjusted basis million of the decline was attributable to a noncash swing in model credit valuation adjustment on customer derivatives this resulted in a million charge this quarter relative to a million benefit last quarter we also experienced seasonal decline in hsa interchange fees and transaction activity tied to commercial clients remained slow in the fourth quarter noninterest expense is on slide we reported adjusted expenses of million down million from the prior quarter reductions in reoccurring fdic insurance and technology costs were partially offset by increased marketing and employee benefit costs slide details components of our allowance for credit losses which was effectively flat relative to prior quarter after recording million in net chargeoffs we incurred a million provision million of which was attributable to macro and credit factors and million of which was attributable to loan growth as a result our allowance coverage to loans decreased modestly to basis points from basis points last quarter in part reflecting the mix shift to loans with lower loss content slide highlights our key asset quality metrics on the upper left nonperforming assets are flat to prior quarter and up slightly to prior year with nonperforming loans representing just basis points of total loans commercial classifieds as a percent of commercial loans increased to basis points from basis points as classified loans increased by million on an absolute basis webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 net chargeoffs on the upper right totaled million or basis points of average loans on an annualized basis we divested another million of commercial loans in the quarter and million of residential loans these divestitures resulted in million of the million in net chargeoffs on slide we maintain strong capital levels all capital levels remain in excess of regulatory and internal targets our common equity tier ratio was and our tangible common equity ratio was our tangible book value was a share ill wrap up my comments on slide with our outlook for the outlook includes the pro forma impact of ametros which directly impacts deposits net interest income fees and expenses we expect loans to grow in the range of to growth will continue to be driven by our commercial businesses likewise we expect deposits to grow to we expect net interest income of billion to billion on a nonfte basis for those modeling net interest income on an fte basis i would add roughly million to the outlook our net interest income outlook assumes four decreases in the fed funds rate beginning in may noninterest income is forecast to be in the range of million to million this includes approximately million in fees generated by ametros expenses are expected to be in the billion to a billion this includes approximately million due to the addition of ametros representing both operating costs and the estimated intangible amortization or efficiency ratios expected to be in the low to mid40 range we expect an effective tax rate of well continue to be prudent managers of capital and target a common equity tier ratio of approximately with ametros expected to close shortly we anticipate rebuilding capital in the near term after which we are committed to utilizing roughly of our earnings per share repurchases and tuckin acquisitions similar to those that we have announced in the past couple of years with that ill turn it back to john for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks glenn despite continued industry headwinds we remain optimistic about our prospects for webster is in an advantageous

opportunity to grow the company in strategically compelling areas well continue to invest in our people and technology further enabling that opportunity given these dynamics and the starting point for our efficiency ratio we will make these investments while maintaining pure leading profitability and returns im going to conclude my remarks with a few acknowledgments of thanks as we near the twoyear anniversary of the merger with sterling jack kopnisky will move out of his role as executive chairman of the company and i will become chair jacks counsel and partnership in building our company has

want to take this opportunity to publicly offer our collective thanks to jack webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 thank you to our colleagues for their efforts and on behalf of our shareholders and clients was a challenging year in terms of industry turmoil and the work that went into completing our core conversion our colleagues put in a ton of work building our franchise and achieving our financial results thank you all for joining us on the call today operator glenn and i will open the line for questions question and answer section operator certainly operator instructions and as a reminder please limit yourself to one question and one followup and any additional questions please requeue your first question comes from the line of mark fitzgibbon from piper sandler please go ahead your line is open mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp morning mark mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co first question i had glenn based on where yields are today do you plan to continue to grow and extend the securities book in the first quarter to sort of further reduce asset sensitivity glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes mark thanks we did as you probably saw we did add about billion in securities at the end of the fourth quarter so i think that bodes well going into the next couple of quarters and actually we did it opportunistically at a high rate environment so we feel good about that but the real intent was to further minimize our asset sensitivity mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co but glenn do you plan to continue to do that in the first quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah i mean itll be not to the extent that its billion but it will be at a smaller level and with reinvest we have approximately million coming off the quarter in our invested securities portfolio which will be reinvestment mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 okay and then just real quick secondly did you sell any office loans or loan notes in the quarter and if so where did you sell them relative to par john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp we did mark i would say and weve been talking about this the kind of progressive decline in the market values i think mid but the loan sales were smaller this quarter and they werent all office so we did do some balance sheet repositioning but not as robustly and not in bulk like we had in the last few quarters as i noted the million decline in the quarter in office this quarter interestingly was primarily from payoffs and refinances at market in par so we didnt do a lot of office sales this quarter mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matt breese from stephens please go ahead your line is open matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc i was hoping we could touch on loan yields expansion was a bit less and i was expecting this quarter up bps in the bps and i was curious one what are incremental loan yields today have they changed quarter to quarter and then is the fact that we saw a slowdown in loan yield expansion tied to just the lack of fed hikes or could you provide more color on that glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so i mean i just did the numbers at the beginning so in the fourth quarter our commercial loan yields were basis points for what was originated in the fourth quarter and total loans was pretty much same range i think basis points somewhere around there and go ahead john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 yeah matt so its interesting rate and obviously we hit on it in the beginning we had backended loan originations in the quarter which hurt nii growth and we also if you look yearoveryear right we have million less than mortgage warehouse because weve exited that business the other dynamic there is that the mix of business was highquality nonoffice commercial real estate fund banking which had almost a full point of lower weighted average risk rating but on the other side also lower yielding so we didnt see as much origination i would say given market conditions and given credit appetite in sponsored specialty and so a little bit of the mutation if you will in the expansion of yield had to do with the loan mix in the fourth quarter as much as anything matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then my second one youd mentioned intangibles tied to ametros and i was curious what is the breakdown or the types of intangibles and if its cdi what is the amortization methodology and timeframe to recapture that glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah its a great question and were still working through the intangibles on that we havent closed on it yet but its a little different than the typical banking type of transaction and that these have a life somewhere in excess of years so you would expect the intangible amortization to be using the bank in the bank space its the maximum years but in this case i think it would probably be further out than that matthew breese q analyst stephens inc but its safe to assume its a cdi versus goodwill glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah primarily yes matthew breese q analyst stephens inc all right ill leave it there thank you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp great operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead your line is open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey john hey glenn maybe a question on capital you basically said that youre going to pause on the buybacks for a bit until you build a little bit more postametros i guess twopart question whats your best estimate for pro forma cet1 for the deal and then anything precluding you from resuming buybacks maybe q2 q3 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so thanks chris and what i said was that in the near term and so i think that you can think about common equity tier coming right about down to our target level of in the first quarter and then wed begin to build capital from that john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah thats exactly right chris and i think we clearly have in our plan and our expectations if there are no other productive uses of organic capital that we will look at dividend and repurchases in the latter half of the year maybe the second third and fourth quarter over time we generally repurchased shares to offset grants to employees as well and well continue to do that so its still part of our game plan were just being i think a little bit cautious and prudent as we look at our capital levels through the ametros closing we also potentially have opportunities in balance sheet and securities repositioning that could go into that bucket of decisions as well but we anticipate returning capital to shareholders over the second half of the year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then maybe one on the nii guide i think youve got an outlook that looks more similar to ours which has a little bit fewer cuts in the futures market if we were to get the six cut five six cuts by how would your nii outlook change from what you provided glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so i think if we got six cuts and we have four cuts in there now it would probably its not really that significant to us we do have some hedges that would kick in but i think its probably in the range just to give you a ballpark of million to million downside so its not that significant christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and that million to million is for given the cadence indiscernible webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah in so if you took our guidance at the low end nii and you said we got six cuts it would probably be in the range of then you take out million to million on that christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thank you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks chris operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire from jefferies please go ahead your line is open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah great thanks good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp morning casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc morning so glenn just following up on another one on the nii guide so looking at slide giving us the cumulative beta in the first quarter to i was wondering if you could give us the progression throughout the year where does that cumulative beta peak in the tightening cycle and then how does it progress after you get these four cuts beginning in may glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah so i think it will be casey i think it will stay around that plus or minus i think the dynamic there is going to be our deposit repricing and so if you look at our book of billion about or say million of that book is what i would characterize as high beta no lag type of deposits so those is the fed and think of ametros perfect example almost billion john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp interlink webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp im sorry interlink im getting ahead of interlink say billion right and so that would reprice one on one with fed funds and it would be immediate so thats an example of a high beta no lag type of deposit so when i look at our deposit book its about so id say billion to billion of our billion so thatll be a benefit for us so i think itll probably end up around were at plus or minus somewhere around there the other factor you have is that our down deposit beta is probably going to run on a fullyear basis in the mid right so thatll help offset some of it as well casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and ametros i did bring up ametros that will lower our beta because obviously were bringing in million at a few basis points and thats expected to grow by a year casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just yeah just following up on so the fee and expense guide implies a decent ramp from the current run rate i know obviously ametros is on the come here just wondering can you break out what is organic or what is legacy webster and then what does ametros add just so we can get a better feel for ramps glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah let me take a run at it and then john can add some color so core expenses were billion say in and as you saw the guidance billion to billion in so round numbers that represents growth of like million to million and if you peel that back i would say approximately million is tied to ametros so that includes operating costs associated with employees the technology platform along with the intangible amortization and about half of the remains thats million and about half the remains is tied to performancebased comp right so million say tied to performancebased comp and then another million tied to investment in revenuegenerating type of business lines so you got million from performancebased comp another or million from performancebased comp million from investments in the business and then million on ametros in very broad numbers john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and then the fees he asked glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 oh and then fees okay so on nii so our noninterest yeah noninterest income sorry so core noninterest income million for were projecting million to million so you got million to million in yearoveryear growth and about million thats tied to ametros right which is the mix of account administration fees pharmacy and other transactional sort of rebate type of fees the remaining growth is sort of of course a number of categories like has interchange up million to million commercial lending fees which include swaps syndication and transactional type of fees million to million trust investment fees some smaller cash management fees so that gives you that sort of geography of it john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and casey to put a finer point on expenses right it looks like a high headline number but to glenns point half of the increase in the guided expenses really are related to ametros acquisition and of those expenses as glenn said part of it is opex and part of it is the amortization of intangibles and then you have performancebased compensation yearoveryear an increase in expectation which most of the industry is seeing if you then look down the remaining increase in core expenses is about or slightly under and that has some investment in teams and people and projects and technology even if we execute all of those things with our range of expectations were still going to be in the low to mid40 from an efficiency perspective which i think is unique for us giving us the opportunity to be on offense and to continue to invest into the kind of revenue tailwinds and the rate decline and obviously we have opportunities should the tailwinds with respect to nii or fees get higher than we expect to curtail on the timing on some of those investments and lower expenses if we need to so i feel pretty good about where we are ending up at those financial metrics we promised over time given the guidance weve given and i think the headline number on the expense is really neat so you kind of peel it back and realize that half of it is not organic its the acquisition and the rest of it is kind of performancebased and investment in new revenue opportunities casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks for breaking it out operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 can you talk about the guidance for the to loan growth in where do you see that growth coming from and i guess what do you view as a catalyst right like how much help do you need from the environments to get to that now high end of that range john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i think thats a great question and obviously we realize that the to guide is kind of on the top end of what youre seeing in the market and the good news from our vantage point is we hope that weve got a good finger on the pulse of our pipeline and our clients and the markets and the sectors we serve so what i would say is were not projecting that with a hopeandpray attitude that the market conditions improve were understanding our original assumptions going in were that we would have higher loan growth than that and so i really do think weve got a lot of opportunity weve gone through our pipelines in commercial the majority of the originations in the loan growth will come in those commercial categories which will be nonoffice cre commercial public sector finance sponsor and specialty general ci end market and fund banking those are the areas we obviously have good equipment finance and abl capabilities too but i would say those core commercial categories where the growth is and the other finer point in talking to our head of commercial banking and looking at our pipeline going forward and the momentum we had at the end of the quarter in terms of booking is that youre seeing while you may not see overall loan demand starting to flourish obviously its still a bit muted in some of the transactional areas were starting to see more trading of assets and more transactional activity and for us for webster in our unique businesses that means real estate investors private equity sponsors who are starting to see more activity in terms of buying and selling assets or buying and selling companies and thats why weve seen our pipeline grow significantly as we head into the first quarter well obviously keep people updated as we go quarter to quarter but right now weve got a good level of confidence that that bogey on the low end of the range is something thats attainable without taking too much risk and continuing to execute kind of within our underwriting boxes and with our existing strategies around segments and geography manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc very helpful and then if you can speak a little bit about the credit side especially on commercial credit i know there was a smaller increase this quarter on the commercial classified loan bucket but if you can expand on what youre seeing there and if you could dig in a little bit on what youre seeing in nonoffice cre john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure were not really seeing any degradation in nonoffice ill start with your last question in nonoffice cre and we seem to be managing maturities well and sponsors and owners seem to be connected to their loans so i wouldnt know any significant deterioration there at all i think the way i characterize the quarter from a credit perspective is being relatively unchanged from prior quarter is pretty accurate we had a few loans in ci go into classifieds we also reduced our nonperformers modestly so we kind of had some offsets there and the overall credit profile remains stable webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 were not seeing any and again i havent dealt with you a lot but many know that i was the chief credit risk officer during the great recession and thereafter i have been surprised like many of us that theres been no capitulation in certain areas right and were still seeing significant resiliency in the consumer we have no issues at all in our home equity and mortgage loans with respect to delinquencies or issues and in ci people have been pretty resilient and were seeing some level of investment the areas that we still focus on i would say in sponsoring specialty healthcare services those are sort of secular pressures contracting which generally is cyclical but weve done a good job proactively either avoiding certain sectors and certain opportunities or being able to remediate things quickly and then obviously youve seen us reduce our office exposure geez by almost million over the course of the last five or six quarters without material loss so i think the overall net risk rating migration in the portfolio continues to be modestly to the downside but with proactive risk management and working through things were not seeing any material areas of stress in the portfolio even if you look at the chargeoff numbers i think for the year we ended up at about basis points interestingly thats kind of the same as the fiveyear average prepandemic so youre really that gives you a perspective of where credit performance is now even to prepandemic levels and within that basis points basis points of the basis points is related to proactive balance sheet management and loan sales so we really havent seen kind of a credit wave that i think people have been expecting for time but we continue to monitor pretty aggressively manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc appreciate all the detail thank you operator your next question comes from the line of daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead your line is open daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hey thanks guys good morning everybody john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey daniel daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just a quick one almost all my questions have been asked at this point just i guess to put a finer point on the indiscernible amortization discussion around the ametros expenses in did you have a number that is baked into your forecast that we could just pull out the operating of ametros from glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so what i would say is we said expenses would be up million and i would say about half of that is going to be intangible amortization webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thats all i had thanks guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks dan operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i want to just go back to the margin for you glenn so the nim at is fairly strong right many of your peers are in the club as we think about the potential for fed cuts right which is a shortterm negative given an assetsensitive balance sheet but longterm positive given the potential for a steeper curve put this together for us like how do we think the nim does the nim trend up in the early part of and then down once we start getting those cuts and then once we do get a normal curve how do you think about a normal nim first where you are in glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so yeah thanks steve so i think the sic is sort of more of an anomaly for us given the originations that occurred john i think highlighted in his remarks over billion of loan origination securities originations at the end of the quarter so well get the full benefit of that as we get into the first quarter and then if you add things like ametros and you just think of it like mathematically million is coming in at a minimum were going to pay down fhlb borrowings that are right so you get the immediate benefit of that that will carry out through the whole year so that will support our nim the other thing and i know weve talked about this in the past is we continue to have this dynamic as i think all do that fixed rate loans are repricing so for us its like billion billion at some quarters of fixed rate loans that are repricing and to the extent they reprice the fixed rate loans youre picking up basis points so thats added to nim as well the securities purchases like we talked about at the end of the quarter you get the fullyear benefit of that when you think about the restructuring we did on million we probably picked up about basis points on that these are all additive to them and i think whats the dynamic here is that youre seeing nim supported in the first couple of quarters and it will carry out through the year youll see we are asset sensitive so in the back webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 half of the year as the fed starts to cut youll see deposit costs begin to what will initially be a lag will begin to reprice down as well so all that ins and outs and theres a lot of moving pieces as im sure you can appreciate i would expect that the nim would be in the range of with some potential upside depending on how the balance sheet rolls out john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah and steve i think you have the dynamic right right we get some opportunity in the near term a little more pressure in the long term this year when they start cutting but as glenn said we feel pretty confident given the moves weve made that we can keep that nim relatively stable at a rate better than most of the industry steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay and then i had a question on hsa bank which had a decent year overall for so as you guys know theres quite a bit of speculation since the last earnings call in terms of your appetite to retain the business john can you frame for us how you look at hsa bank today right i looked at the slide and i say well maybe its not as important as it used to be to the franchise do you feel that the value of hsa bank is being held back by being inside of webster can you give me your update there john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp sure i dont so ill answer the question in kind of short term and its every bit as important to us as its been obviously from a pure financial contribution perspective given the size of the organization now its a slightly smaller contributor but nonetheless hugely important to us from a revenue and fee and obviously low cost loan duration deposit perspective i can clarify on this call because i knew there was a lot of activity and speculation after our last phone call i answered that question the way i had answered it every single quarter when asked what happened steve was that no one asked the question for about six quarters so people thought because i gave an answer that there was a new perspective no we are not a seller of hsa we are a true believer particularly with the acquisition of the ametros in our ability unique ability as a bank to have diversified funding sources that grow fees at a good clip and i think well be able to and not included in our forecast as i mentioned are opportunities for us to have cross synergies in some of these really unique businesses even throw interlink in there as well but i also do say very carefully every time that were a steward of our shareholders capital and so we continually have to evaluate all of our business lines how we can maximize economic profit in those business lines and whether or not that happens as a whollyowned activity or as a joint venture activity or as a sold activity and so our premise is were not a seller of hsa but obviously were always doing diligence to make sure that were not missing an opportunity to achieve the best value for our shareholders as we allocate capital and make those decisions steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 got it thats helpful color john if i could squeeze one more and violate your twoquestion rule so just regarding this billion potential threshold so you guys ended the year at billion and when we look at some of your peers in the similar asset range a lot of them are on an rwa diet right but when you look at your guidance you guys seem to want to be at the buffet so when you look at that do you see no reason to slow growth like you feel like youre very prepared those rules could change but thats no reason to slow your growth in terms of trying to manage the timeline to get there just what gives you so much more confidence than some of your peers thanks john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah thats a loaded question i mean i think that look i think we have a ways to go before we hit the threshold as you can imagine were spending a lot of time looking at our three and fiveyear plans making sure that were prepared from a compliance and risk management perspective making sure we understand the full impact of the rules if they ultimately are enacted on capital on liquidity on the makeup of our balance sheet steve i think weve got enough flexibility in the asset classes that we grow we can make economic moves to divest or to slow growth quickly and were not up against the gun with respect to looking at this over the next to months i think we still have some running room to service customers to take care of our existing clients and continue to plan for the eventuality of billion and so we dont think that its time to pull back and slow growth now but every move were making and everything were doing strategically we obviously have an eye toward what does that mean when you overlay the billion requirement so i know that may not be a satisfying answer but know that were thinking about it were thinking about what it means for our future view on ma do you want to crawl over billion do you want to avoid it do you want to jump well over billion those are the discussions were having and were positioning ourselves quite frankly because of the uncertainty in the market to be able to take advantage of any one of those strategies if its the right strategy at the time so i dont think were putting ourselves in a trapped position by continuing to use our differentiated funding base and origination channels to continue to grow at this pace i dont think we are steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for taking my questions john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston from ubs go ahead your line is open brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey glenn i just wanted to follow up on the securities purchases and restructure with a couple of questions the purchase yield was this quarter so one what are you buying and then two just given the endof quarter purchases the restructurings what was the spot yield for securities at the end of the quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp sure so first on the question that we sold like i said million i think the yield on that was like basis points most of what we bought really during the quarter was nds and within say a 38year duration and a book yield of say does that answer that part brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah it does it does thank you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp okay and then the securities yield i think its at quarter end brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and so you continue to hand the purchase securities if i heard your response to mark correctly in the first quarter so im assuming that youre going to continue purchasing at similar yields that you glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc did here glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah reinvesting like if you think of our securities we probably spins off about million a quarter we would reinvest that and roll it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 okay got it and then just for my followup i just wanted to touch on ametros again thank you for kind of talking about the cdi expense but i wanted to ask just the cagr on the surface it seems like a pretty aggressive kind of growth target just given were banking analysts but i was hoping maybe you could discuss maybe setting the synergies aside why you think thats the appropriate kind of growth target and are the areas of conservatism within that guidance where you could kind of outperform it organically even without synergies glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah remember its off a pretty small base and weve got historic data and theres a great management team there and a great team and theyve demonstrated the ability to do it as i noted there really is a pretty strong pipeline you can see the natural growth its kind of like hsa it gets very predictable and its also like hsa a little bit in that they had great relationships with both their account holders and the insurance companies that they do work for and so weve got pretty good line of sight to growth off a relatively small base going forward and youve got kind of a bunch of that is contractor future payments so you kind of know whats coming in so i think we feel pretty comfortable that thats kind of a reasonable range where we see the upside i mentioned it in my comments we dont factor in right now any other expansion into different product sets with similar characteristics and i know the ceo there whos really talented have good line of sight with capital investment behind him to be able to expand the markets that they serve we dont factor in any synergies between account holders in some of our other businesses and crosssell opportunities so the upside is really our opportunity to figure out new ways for them to do it but in terms of our baseline cagr growth we feel very confident that thats kind of a very predictable strong line of sight to that growth over the next five years brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and if i could sneak one more in just given the strength of the business on a standalone basis i know its smaller for you guys but just given the pipeline given the growth outlook why did long ridge think it was the right time for them to sell just because it seems like theres going to be a lot of strength in that business line going forward john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah theres no story there at all its just a natural private equity investment and it was time for them to divest we knew the company through our relationships with sponsor and specialty and it wasnt an auction process we were able to convince the team and the sellers that we were the right buyer and it was a very smooth transaction so theres no story there and thats it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for answering my questions everyone john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets please go ahead your line is open jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning just a couple of cleanup questions on the loan trajectory just dissecting that what drove the late quarter growth and just talk a little bit about what change or what the drivers were john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah most of the originations were driven in the quarter by core ci but in particular fund banking very low risk and lower yielding quite frankly but obviously we believe its still economically profitable loan growth along with some high quality multifamily and some public sector finance which is kind of our national government banking again all of those assets higher quality than the overall portfolio on a riskrated basis slightly lower yielding which was why we gave the answer to the question earlier about lower than expected yield expansion in the quarter and again particularly in the fund banking side much of that closed by yearend and so we were kind of working through our pipeline and thats why things closed in december as opposed to closing earlier in the quarter jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so no real story just given that ph right weight john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp no just jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah just timing and it happens quarter to quarter jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay just a second question bigger picture john it seems like the sterling merger has gone well it seems like you and jack have been on the same page but any new priorities for you as chairman im assuming its business as usual but thought i would ask as long as you mentioned it john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 no were completely aligned and well continue to be and obviously ill continue to seek out his counsel even after hes left the organization but no theres no pivot at all we spend a lot of time the entire team management team and board making sure that kind of we knew what the north star was and what we were trying to build and were still on that journey we still have opportunities we think weve got good line of sight to continue to deliver a 20ish roatc or 14ish roa and a leading efficiency ratio to give us flexibility to grow and i think all the things were doing are the things we thought we would do obviously the environment has been a little bit volatile over time but therell be no pivot in culture strategy or other things youll see us continue to try and execute at a high level jon glenn arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bernard von gizycki from deutsche bank please go ahead your line is open bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi guys good morning maybe just staying on sterling with integration now past you theres been these discussions of the opportunities to enhance some of the areas in fee income across commercial consumer as you say you talked about treasury cash management card fx as areas of growth but can you provide any size priming of these opportunities if possible what could be implied in your guide for john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i mean as you know on the cash management card fx and some of the other ancillary businesses we do have built in as glenn mentioned into our increase in fees relatively good doubledigit growth in those off of a relatively small base compared to our nii and the truth of the matter is that those activities are not going to materially change the outcome of our steady growth right so were working on those things weve already rolled out new capabilities for our clients things like ametros move the needle a little bit in terms of glenn talked to you about the contribution in expected fees in the year and so thats going to be good we keep looking at interesting opportunities and not built into our forecast and definitely too early to talk about but opportunities around capital markets around syndicating around securitization like are there opportunities given our strong origination capabilities to generate fee income and further have other options to manage the balance sheet but those are things we think about to drive fee income over the long term but nothing in our plans right now and nothing that i would be comfortable giving you guidance on bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc understood i think last quarter maybe just talking about the expenses the expense opportunities that still remain i think you talked about consolidation of subledgers back office processes and call center consolidation maybe could you help frame any of the remaining opportunity on this front webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i think glenn might comment but i think thats sort of built into our overall net expense view some of the stuff is a little stickier than others weve made progress on consolidation of the call centers we have opportunity there we still need to decommission some old noncore technology that in the transition stays but i would say its an offset to the investments that we think were going to make in future technology and so i dont know if you get an estimate for what you think the full run rate of some of those opportunities glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp i would just come back to mid to low40 efficiency ratio and thats where we expect to be and so what that implies is it gives us first of all optionality to the extent theres more market headwinds so we have some optionality there but i also think the more important point is is that we are still getting i know as a cfo in my world were still consolidating ledgers and theres implications down to reconciliations and stuff like that but that gives us an opportunity to reinvest in the business as well so i think we like to think of it as were best in class at at low to mid on the efficiency ratio and so i would just use if youre thinking of modeling it thats what i would use as a guide bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for the color guys john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you operator your next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger from citigroup please go ahead your line is open benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hey good morning guys i was curious john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey good morning and welcome benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc appreciate it yeah if we could just think about just the deposit franchise in general i think when casey asked the question you gave some deposit beta assumptions on your different niches i was just curious if the forward curve is correct or even just the forecast assumption are there any flow differences or what you might see in a deposit mix in general i guess thats down basis points in a nonrecessionary environment and is kind of webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 unprecedented but just kind of just your thoughts on what that deposit mix might look like or how flows might change over the course of those 100ish bps going forward glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yeah its a good question so theres a couple of things that i think are unique to us and obviously we talked a lot about ametros we do have the benefit of hsa as well where we get the enrollment period in the first quarter and then we continue to get those accounts funded during the year we have interlink which gives us optionality from the ability to increase core deposits or to the extent we have were satisfied with our loanto deposit ratio to lay some of those off so that gives us optionality as well i think the thing that were watching is as far as the flow of deposits we do have maturities on cds coming due about billion in the first quarter another just under that in the second quarter so thats something that were keeping a close eye on on how that rolls over and were also keeping an eye on things like demand or pure dda which has come down a little bit so were basically weve been hovering around that billion mark we think that probably has potential to grow about million over the course of the year so those are the sort of things that were thinking i dont see anything significant i think youll still see a little bit more of deposit flow from low interestbearing type of money market and savings account into cds to the extent people or our clients think that rates are going to drop they might want to go a little longer on their investments and things like that we have continued to see that but i think those are very basic dynamics john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah i would agree with glenn and i think i hope were answering the question youre asking which is the first points down i dont think it changes necessarily behaviors by customers and depositors or kind of overall bank nonbank deposit flows benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you yeah thats really helpful and then just from a followup just to play a little bit of devils advocate here i know that you said that the forward curve is correct theres kind of the sixish cuts you probably have a little bit of downside relative to that nii range which in reality probably put your revenue at the floor maybe a little bit below the combined range today and i know you said you had flexibility on expenses could you also put expenses overall below the billion or is that kind of the floor in terms of investment and we just expect a slightly higher purchase ratio for the year glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp boy interesting question no i mean i think we always have optionality right because some of it is project based and investment based and if the market conditions change and are more dramatic than that the projected performancebased incentive comp cutting line comes down naturally so theres we can clearly go below the billion if the overall environment demanded us to do that but i would say again kind of dramatically that we believe we have the opportunity to invest and even at those expense levels well still have the most efficient operating model in the top banks and so yes we do have webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 flexibility there are some variable costs in there and some projectbased investments that we could either delay or cancel or pull back on if we had to benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful color appreciate it operator your next question comes from the line of laurie hunsicker from seaport research partners please go ahead your line is open laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc great hi thanks good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hey laurie laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc just going back to ametros here can you help us think what the pro forma intangibles will look like and also just maybe fine tune a little bit when the closing date is expected in the first quarter glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so on the pro forma i think you can think of it as a spring in an million immediately in deposits and the immediate action would be dependent on fhlb and so call out to in the quarter right percent on those and then it would eventually or quickly move into funding loans which you heard me say earlier are more in the range of like i talked about the fee income being million and i talked about the expenses in the range of million with half of that being cdi so i think you can build the pl pretty quickly the thing i would point out is john and we talked earlier is that this is a business thats going to grow at cagr every year so were bringing in million good chance well be closer to the billion range by the end of this year and that will continue based on contractual relationships and everything you see in the market so that should allow you to build your sort of pl john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp closing date and laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc and then just webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp oh closing date closing date john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp and pro forma intangibles shift glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so yeah of the intangibles of the million expense i think its about half of that and then relatively soon john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp end of january is the estimate plus or minus glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp yes laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc end of jan okay so just on the pro forma intangible figure billion grows by about million thats it did i hear that right glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp im not sure say that again laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc so your billion that you have in total intangibles on your balance sheet your goodwill and other intangible assets that grows by million with this acquisition glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so the intangible amortization is about million in the year laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc got it okay so what is the dollar amount of glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp so the intangibles so yeah so the intangibles are probably closer to like million webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc million great thank you that was the number i was looking for okay and just one last glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp we are not complete on that im estimating that right now laurie havener hunsicker q analyst seaport global securities llc got you makes sense and then just going back to office what were the office chargeoffs in the fourth quarter and if you have it what were the office chargeoffs for your fullyear glenn i macinnes a chief financial officer executive vice president webster financial corp let me see if i can get that for you laurie they werent meaningful in this quarter i think charges including all the proactive note sales were roughly in the million to million range for the entire year and that includes all of as i said the proactive note sales so not sort of fully mature chargeoffs i mean there are losses nonetheless and i think it wasnt particularly a meaningful contribution to this quarters chargeoffs im still looking for the number i apologize but as i said were getting to the point where that book we feel pretty confident around kind of whats left and the credit support we have underlying in we feel really good about how aggressive which weve brought down that exposure operator your next question comes from the line of timur braziler from wells fargo please go ahead your line is open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp hi timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe circling back on ametros just one more there whats the total addressable market for that space and i guess as that business grows whats the risk of new competition coming in and maybe eating away of some of that expected cagr john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call 23jan2024 yeah its obviously theyre the market leader but theres a huge untapped i think its billion in total claims in their space right now so theres a lot of running room its early days and their value proposition i think is starting to be realized by more of the insurers and more account holders in the industry so its very low penetrated from a professional administrative perspective which is one of the things that we think is so exciting about the business timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah and is there a risk that maybe some of that competition eats into your growth rate john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp again given the total addressable market and the good penetration that these guys have with respect to customer base i think a lot of it is contractual and so i think at least in terms of our projections now we dont see any risk from cannibalization from competitors and its our opportunity i think to be a first mover across the industry and to continue to expand timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great and then my followup just looking at new york city multifamily can you give us the breakdown of rent regulated versus market rate properties and to the extent you have any exposure to pre2019 hstpa real change john r ciulla a president chief executive officer director webster financial corp yeah very little exposure to pre2019 i would say about lets see after the more than half of our loans are booked after the regulation multifamily billion in of rent regulated multifamily down from the third q level of billion this is an interesting stat for you that the portfolio is obviously diversified but the average commitment is million we only have seven loans with exposures over million there so very granular and nonchunky portfolio with no tall trees which i think makes us feel pretty comfortable and criticized classified loans are kind of below the overall credit stats of the rest of the commercial book and so theres only one delinquent loan right now in that billion so we dont see any credit story there right now operator we have no further questions in our queue at this time i will now turn the call back over to john ciulla for closing remarks john r ciulla president chief executive officer director webster financial corp thank you really appreciate everybody staying on the call and your engagement with the company have a great day operator this concludes todays conference call thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect webster financial corp wbs corrected transcript q4 earnings call
