come to respect morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 lets turn to the slides turning first to slide over the last years we have transformed the firms business mix scale profitability and returns if you compare various historical periods you can see our business evolution each period faced its own challenges in to morgan stanley was a classic selfhelp story transformation began with the acquisition and integration of smith barney the investment bank was reset and the firm survived the near triple credit downgrade and the euro crisis in to we weathered the years of financial repression resizing our fixed income business and pressing ahead to the top slot in institutional equities during this period we also acquired solium which was a step toward leadership in the corporate stock plan space then in to the covid years we achieved incremental scale in both wealth and investment management with the acquisitions of etrade and eaton vance giving us a leading selfdirected platform and pushing forward in investment solutions during this period each of the two major business lines wealth and investment management and institutional securities generated operating leverage and high returns transformed morgan stanley today has tripled client assets in its durable businesses with significant opportunities for further growth notwithstanding 2023s geopolitical macroeconomic and industry challenges the firms business model generated consistent results in firm revenues were billion with billion of pbt double the averages of to our return on tangible common equity was a solid inclusive of notable items that reduced returns by over basis points last years return profile was triple the post crisis years combined earnings from wealth and investment management generated of the firms top line and pbt and our category of one asset gathering strategies set the stage for continued durable growth the institutional securities business also grew over the transformation years with an eye to investing in its leading franchises the objective has been to create an integrated investment bank of investment banking equities and fixed income to serve leading institutions around the world taken together the morgan stanley business portfolio of today has well higher and more stable profitability the actions weve taken over the last years organic and inorganic were all within our core strategic footprint at its center is acting as a trusted advisor to clients helping them raise allocate and manage capital it is what we do we are a global leader and we are really good at it this will not change turning to slide in revenues in wealth and investment management have more than doubled and today were number one in the world among our peers during the same period our client assets have more than tripled to trillion we see continued opportunity to drive growth and are steadfast in our goal of reaching trillion in total client assets in wealth management weve established ourselves as a leading asset gatherer by expanding our business model across three channels advisorled selfdirected and workplace the business generated trillion of net new assets over the past three years and we are relentlessly focused on sustainable growth we expect nna growth to continue to vary quarterbyquarter given seasonality and even yeartoyear given market tone and the cadence of migrating workplace assets and attracting assets held away we are nevertheless confident in our ability to continue to grow and deepen our million relationships with the breadth of our wealth management offering over time our ability to attract deepen and retain client relationships with our differentiated platform allows us to drive revenue growth and operating leverage enabling margins given some of the recent macro headwinds and our continued investments for growth its reasonable to expect reported margins to consolidate in the mid morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 range over the near term the underlying business has achieved margins before and we intend to deliver that return profile again in the long term against a higher base of revenue our wealth platform is complemented by investment management where weve added a number of new capabilities to our strong public market alpha engines this business is well aligned to key areas where we see secular growth including customization such as parametric private markets and valueadd credit at a holistic level the wealth and investment management business has achieved the kind of scale which enables us to invest in what matters most to clients and to take further market share through cycles turning to slide morgan stanleys institutional securities group our integrated investment bank is a preeminent global franchise our capability set extensive client footprint and premier brand put us in a position to be the trusted advisor to every important corporation public or private asset manager and asset owner our teams across geographies businesses and client segments position us at the center of global capital allocation and formation over the last decade weve advised on nearly trillion in ma transactions raised nearly trillion of capital for clients and as indication of our markets presence in a single trading session last month our equities business transacted roughly billion of notional value our leadership position outside the us acting as a true global investment bank is critical to the morgan stanley franchise after more than five years managing our integrated investment bank i would add that it is clear from client visits around the world that the barriers to entry to becoming a global investment bank are real today there are fewer competitors and we are one of those very few who can provide the full breadth of capabilities we expect the next economic and financial cycle to be led by corporate finance activity which will drive investment banking growth and as such are particularly focused on expanding our wallet share in that advicedriven business turning to slide when you combine our wealth and investment management platform with our leading institutional franchise you see the power of what we will call the integrated firm our capacity to source new client opportunities efficiently facilitate the flow of capital and deliver morgan stanley firmwide solutions has never been stronger looking at the right side of the slide more specifically our premier corporate franchise spans every business segment

to source and structure customized opportunities for corporations and financial sponsors our structuring capabilities are augmented by scaled distribution channels extending from the largest institutions through the individual retail client set with a central focus on our clients we see significant opportunities in delivering the integrated firm turning to slide ultimately the firms success relies on our human capital and maintaining a differentiated partnership culture with james as executive chairman and together with andy saperstein and dan simkowitz as our copresidents our highest priority is delivering the integrated firm to our clients our shared morgan stanley experience having all lived through the 15year transformation gives us a lens into where we come from and morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 where we are going intentional mobility of our leadership engineered by james over these many years is particularly important andy in his expanded role as head of both wealth and investment management is well situated to leverage the deep knowledge of retail distribution and products to drive client opportunities across the business dan having successfully revitalized investment management for nearly a decade is returning to lead institutional securities where he spent years hell play a critical role in connecting the firm around sourcing opportunities structuring financing and distributing capital for our clients both these gentlemen have burnished the brand and successfully integrated acquisitions to have james dan and andy as partners to open speaks to the enduring strength of our culture our broader leadership team has worked together since the financial crisis through the strategic transformation and today are unified in advancing toward our goals the operating and management committees of the firm each have an average tenure of more than years long tenure is one element that maintains the strength of a learning culture of serving clients in a firstclass way in addition to backing the morgan stanley experience set of our longstanding leaders were enhanced by the injection of some key lateral hires and joiners via our acquisitions our businesses are supported by a worldclass technology and infrastructure organization and by talented managing directors of whom we promoted with a partnership last week our people are what makes morgan stanleys culture and drives us to be excellent on behalf of our clients to be prudent fiduciaries of capital and to maintain a keen awareness of the road we have traveled to achieve the firm we have today turning to slide in addition to one the performance of the business two driving the integrated firm and three maintaining our culture we are four highly focused on the state of our financial capital given our deliberate growth and durable earnings over the last several years our capital position is strong going to the finalization of basel iii endgame our regulatory requirements as measured within our stress capital buffer have steadily come down since reflecting the improved resilience of our businesses with respect to basel iii endgame we continue to believe after fulsome industry comment and further valuation of economic and competitive impacts that the final rule will result in a well more constructive outcome than originally proposed particularly as it pertains to matters that are driving our estimated rwa inflation looking ahead we remain committed to the dividend as is it at the core of our business models durability while we will toggle among opportunities to support our clients grow our businesses and repurchase our stock the core strengths and strategic decisions of the last years are reflected in our quarterly dividend which weve grown from to per share the continued sustainability of that dividend is paramount with the firm coming together we will drive toward our performance goals slide reiterates our confidence in them our strategy and longterm value proposition remain intact the four firmwide goals are in place hitting trillion in client assets achieving a wealth management pretax margin ph we have firmwide efficiency ratio and achieving returns on tangible equity our management team is steeled to execute against our priorities to reach these goals we enter with confidence and our base case for the coming year is constructive there are two major downside risks the first is geopolitical that global conflicts intensify and conflagrate the second is the state of the us economy over the course of the base case is benign namely that of a soft landing but if the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 economy weakens dramatically in the quarters to come and the fed has to move rapidly to avoid a hard landing that would likely result in lower asset prices and activity levels on the other hand if inflation in fact ph has not been beaten back and continues to challenge consumers and the supply chain that could result in a stickier fed and the resulting higherforlonger will have to absorbed in the way of a higherthanexpected cost of capital and the dangers of a bifurcated economy these risks the geopolitical and that of the us economy presents some uncertainties as we start nevertheless as we have discussed this morning the morgan stanley of today is meant to perform through the cycle and based on the evidence we see our building ma and ipo pipelines improving boardroom confidence and an increasingly positive tone from our retail and institutional clients we remain constructive on the year ahead we will execute on our clear and consistent strategy we have a global business a worldclass wealth and investment manager alongside a leading investment bank the growth opportunities are extraordinary especially given how our businesses and regions intersect and support the business strategy we will continue to lead with asset consolidation across wealth and investment management and remain committed to growing highquality share in institutional securities to consistently deliver our integrated firm to clients around the world in so doing we will continue to execute towards our key objectives and to deliver for shareholders i will now turn the call over to sharon who will discuss our fourth quarter and annual results and then together well take your questions thank you sharon yeshaya executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in and ended the year with fourth quarter revenues of billion for the full year rotce was and eps was and for the fourth quarter rotce was and eps was the full year efficiency ratio was a number of factors impacted our annual and quarterly results the full year results include nearly million of notable items over half of these items were reflected in the fourth quarter a million fdic special assessment charge and a legal settlement of million were both realized in the fourth quarter in addition the full year results include million of severance expenses primarily related to a may employee action the combination of these three items negatively impacted full year eps by rotce by basis points and the efficiency ratio by basis points total integrationrelated expenses for the year were million nearly of which was related to etrade with the etrade integration now complete we remain focused on continuing to manage our expense base supporting our longterm efficiency goals while still investing in growth now to the businesses institutional securities full year revenues were billion and quarterly revenues were billion full year results were impacted by the weak investment banking environment that began with the onset of the hiking cycle and geopolitical events in early and persisted through most of the past year fourth quarter revenues reflected stronger investment banking results and prudent risk management across fixed income and equities investment banking revenues were billion for the full year lower completed ma transactions followed a dearth of announcements in the back half of and early which weighed on morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 results however optimism began to rise midyear followed by a notable increase in morgan stanleys announced volumes starting in the third quarter and continuing into the fourth quarter fourth quarter revenues were billion results were supported mostly by fixed income underwriting as the investment grade market remained open for regular way issuance and was supported by eventdriven activity advisory revenues have begun to recover versus recent quarters and were roughly flat yearoveryear equity underwriting revenues were also flat as activity remained muted as we enter we are positioned to capitalize on the opportunity set while downside risks are linked to the consumer with the rate path and geopolitics as two key determinants we expect the us will lead the recovery globally corporate confidence will ultimately drive the cycle forward and we are encouraged by signs that the ceo and boardroom optimism is growing evidenced by the build of our advisory and ipo pipelines our integrated investment bank is well positioned to capitalize on the recovering backdrop particularly where the institution works across the businesses with ceos cfos and treasurers on corporate solutions strength in sentiment should support broad ma and new capital market issuance and eventually feed through to the broader market activity equity full year revenues were billion reflecting lower revenues across regions tempered client engagement was reflective of broad market uncertainty revenues were billion in the fourth quarter prime brokerage revenues in the fourth quarter were solid results reflected narrower spreads and the geographic mix of client balances cash results declined versus last years fourth quarter reflecting lower volume particularly in asia exjapan derivative results were up versus last years fourth quarter as the business continue to grow the client base fixed income revenues were billion for the full year declining from 2022s strong result the full year decline was driven by lower client activity in foreign exchange and commodities which were impacted by greater uncertainty around the rate outlook and less volatile energy markets quarterly revenues were billion macro performance was down versus the prior fourth quarter results reflected fewer monetization opportunities particularly in asia compared to heightened engagement in the region last year micro was down yearoveryear driven by lower revenues in credit corporates which was negatively impacted by movements in credit spreads on the back of geopolitical events results in commodities were up versus last years fourth quarter primarily reflecting improved performance in the power and gas business turning to wealth management for the full year wealth managements revenues were billion and the pre tax profit was billion which resulted in a pbt margin of reported results reflect the complex macro backdrop as well as several idiosyncratic events the unprecedented rise in the absolute level of interest rates were particularly consequential as the subsequent shifts in client behavior impacted the revenue mix and margin in addition there were several expense items that impacted the margin including integrationrelated expenses the fdic special assessment severance charges and the impact of dcp which saw meaningful swings compared to last year taken together these four items impacted the full year margin by over basis points total client assets ended the year at a new high reaching trillion of assets full year feebased flows were billion these flows and associated fees offset the market levels and changes in interest mix of client portfolios supporting the yearoveryear increase in asset management revenues fourth quarter revenues were billion and the reported pbt margin was the aforementioned notable expenses negatively impacted the fourth quarter margin by over basis points morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 asset management revenues in the quarter were billion up approximately million from the prior years fourth quarter quarterly feebased flows were strong at billion underscoring the value clients are seeing in our advicebased model client allocations to higher yielding cash alternatives remained elevated and clients continued to deploy monthly inflows into equity markets from suite balances the eventual return of the new issuance calendar and improved retail sentiment should provide a tailwind as clients look to redeploy into broader asset classes net new assets of billion for the year represented annual growth rate of beginningperiod assets fourth quarter net new assets were billion for the full year net new asset growth was driven by the advisorled channel across existing clients new clients and net recruiting transactional revenues in the fourth quarter were billion excluding the impact of dcp transactional revenues increased slightly yearoveryear as clients invested in structured products and fixed income products bank lending balances of billion remained roughly flat consistent with the environment total deposit increased quarteroverquarter to billion driven by continued demand for our savings offering from our wealth management channel and a modest increase in suite balances net interest income was billion in the quarter the sequential decrease was primarily driven by the mix of average deposits and the blended deposit cost in the quarter looking ahead to the first quarter of the deposit mix will continue to be the primary driver of net interest income the modest sequential build in sweeps was promising and suggests we are nearing a level of frictional sweeps and client accounts assuming that the forward curve holds and that our assumptions around client behavior materialize we would expect nii in the first quarter to be roughly in line with the fourth quarter our assetled gathering strategy remains unchanged and we expect it to deliver margin expansion over time the path is clear and includes the following objectives first increase relationships through our channel second migrate assets to advice third deepen existing client relationships with enhanced capabilities including new products and solutions and finally realize scale benefits of our investments over time these efforts are well underway in the year we grew client relationships by over across the franchise this was led by success in the workplace channel as we continue to win corporate plans and add participants in stock plans in the prior three years we saw an average of billion of workplace assets migrate to the advisorled channel on an annual basis this year client migration was up yearoveryear despite economic headwinds and on the products side our financial advisors are offering clients investment opportunities such as private credit private equity and all the other alternatives bringing wealth and investment management closer together will create greater opportunities for ongoing product creation as we move forward and transition from integration to optimization for client experience we expect to see greater scale benefits from our investments over time investment management reported full year results of billion and fourth quarter revenues of billion aum increased yearoveryear to trillion supported by higher asset values longterm net outflows of approximately billion were driven by headwinds in our msim active equity growth strategies within alternatives and solutions we continue to see demand for parametric customized portfolios across both equity and fixed income strategies as more retail clients seek customized solutions liquidityoverlay services had outflows of billion weaker institutional liquidity flows were partially offset by demand for parametrics morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 overlay product and the combined parametric brand inclusive of overlay and its retail offering had net inflows of over billion again this quarter underscoring the strength of our differentiated customized offering fourth quarter asset management and related fees of billion increased slightly versus last year quarterly performancebased income and other revenues were million gains in us private equity and infrastructure offset losses in real estate reflecting the benefits of diversification in the franchise turning to the balance sheet total spot assets were trillion standardized rwas increased by billion sequentially to billion as we actively supported clients we prudently managed our capital profile and ended the year with a standardized cet1 ratio of while focusing on our strategic priorities including our commitment to return capital to our shareholders utilizing the flexibility of our repurchase authorization we were opportunistic at the start of the fourth quarter and we bought back billion of common stock the full year tax rate was reflecting the realization of certain tax benefits earlier in the year the fourth quarters tax rate was primarily reflecting the tax implications of a specific legal matter we expect the tax rate to be approximately consistent with prior years we continue to expect some quarterly volatility a number of idiosyncratic and macro headwinds added complexity to the backdrop over the last year notwithstanding these challenges we ended the year better than where we started we now have trillion of client assets and we successfully completed our etrade integration as it relates to capital markets boardroom confidence is rising and our calendar is building we approach with optimism keenly aware of the dynamic environment we operate in as we continue to drive towards our performance goals with that we will now open the line up to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 question and answer section operator we are now ready to take in questions operator instructions well take our first question from dan fannon with jefferies your line is now open please go ahead oops it looks like weve lost dan well move to glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much so sharon i love how youve laid out the picture on the wealth management margin potential so my and i do like that sweeps have settled in so im curious in the big picture has fa and client behavior changed a bunch on the cash management front such that thats a potential driver of margin potential and why youre leaning towards that mid near term versus the where we were kind of hanging out when rates were lower and deposits were higher is that the primary driver of the margin thought and do you think behaviors changed like permanently sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so i cant speak to behavior permanently but i appreciate the question glenn if we take a step back it was always a idea on the premise of a sustainable growth in margin was really about ensuring that we continue to see growth in feebased assets and we see growth in that migration towards the advicebased channel and in fact that is what youve begun to see look at our feebased flows this quarter alone and think about the feebased flows that weve had over the course of the year we continue to educate our clients so when we think through the funnel we have more participants we begin to see more assets and then those assets will over time migrate to advice what you point out as we think about the cash and what some might call cash sorting et cetera is that we still have that sitting in cash equivalents so not necessarily bdp but rather cash equivalents that dont necessarily earn a fee right money markets think of a savings product over time et cetera that you might see as individuals begin to take that money and deploy it into markets or deploy it into feebased that will be accretive to the margin over time and that to your point is a place where you should begin to see a margin build and something that becomes more sustainable as we both grow our asset base and grow the advice and the client migration towards advice in those feebased assets glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi makes sense i appreciate that maybe just a followup in wealth if i could it certainly doesnt show in your flows this quarter so i guess i know where youre going to go with this but youre just definitely hearing a lot more from the bankowned wealth management companies that are turning up the heat a little bit on recruiting and a lot more on their intent to better penetrate their banking clients wallet so im curious if you feel any of that in your franchise any of that where you compete and whether or not that impacts your thought process on your ability to attract some of the trillions of dollars held away that is always part of the grow story sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 so the first point id say is its obviously always a competitive market but were very well positioned given the tools that weve given to our advisors a couple of points that i would make to you the first is when we look forward into the first quarter that recruiting pipeline is healthy so when we think about january and what were seeing we see the recruiting being healthy the second point that id mention is what i find to be most encouraging when you look under the nna data is that were seeing new clients come to morgan stanley so its not just attracting assets held away but rather youre actually getting new clients from those participants and then youre seeing conversion so when you think about some of the statistics that i gave you around workplace and we talked about these statistics the workplace assets that move over you have of those assets are actually assets that are coming from outside the institution so youre bringing new clients in and then theyre bringing their assets that are sitting away into the institution so i think were well positioned to capture those opportunities final point that id make is on your banking product actually this idea of the etrade integration right and we talked about weve completed the integration and i said were looking towards the forward or the front office integration some of that will be around banking products et cetera as we think and we look ahead over a multiyear journey operator well take our next question from dan fannon with jefferies your line is now open please go ahead daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning congrats on the new role ted i was hoping you could elaborate on the current environment a little bit more and maybe what you see as the biggest opportunities for growth as you look to make progress against the longerterm targets that youve outlined edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley thanks for your question i think we as you heard from my comments are generally constructive about what brings and it should be beneficial to both arms of the firm some of the reorientation of cash equivalents whether they be in money markets or treasuries and the like that sharon referred to and redeployed by our wealth clients into the markets ph by giving increasing sense of stability clearly good for fas and for the wealth channel in the investment bank weve had a decadeslong ph drought in ipos the slowest volume weve seen in decades and as you know weve had a very light ma calendar so that also has been in a trough sort of early cycle type activity from our highest margin products inside of the investment bank but specifically inside of investment banking we think inure to our benefit too so we quite possibly could have a dynamic where if we are in this soft landing zone we could see increased activity ultimately we are in the tickets business activity based in both channels and benign economic conditions augur well for both wealth and investment but also for the investment bank and part of the reason i want to talk about the integrated firm today was because the two segments working together will bring inevitably additional growth opportunities inside the firm we have folks that have mobilized around the enterprise and are now in a position to talk to clients across the product spectrum and to bring in additional business morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 we have a big business as you know in europe and in asia so if economic conditions are better than the expected which is that europe will struggle and china might as well if we do any better than that we would expect to see some increased activity coming out of those regions too so its not just a us proposition but a global one as well daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and you mentioned margins within the wealth channel or wealth segment will consolidate around the mid here in the near term can you maybe unpack some of the inputs that will drive that outcome sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley certainly i worked through that i think dan when i actually tried to explain it in the script so the premise in terms of the growing wealth management margin again is about the conversion to the advicebased model over time of course individuals will have the different pieces right but we have three different channels that weve talked about weve talked about selfdirected weve talked about workplace weve talked about advice on the selfdirected side we will continue to attract those clients and those that might be interested in advice will see it as we have different ways to give people a sense and a connection to fas so weve talked about that on the workplace side we continue to get new participants new corporate relationships and that as we educate people with the wellness offering et cetera and weve seen evidence of this to bring people yet again to that advicedriven model and the feebased flows as you see those those will help us grow the asset management line then you can break it down again the transactional line weve talked about youre going to have new products and youre going to have a deployment of this cash thats been sitting on the sidelines that weve talked a lot about the dry powder that could impact either the transactional line or the asset management line and again were encouraged by the signs that were seeing in nii that too suggests that we are seeing as of right now it looks like that cash that frictional level of cash is stabilizing ph then you have the drivers in each of those lines as we think about the revenue side and then as you think about the expense side those we are looking for places to invest and gain from the scale of those investments and that will be as part of the objectives that ted laid out when you see trillion of assets operator well move to our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thanks good morning and welcome ted maybe just going back to the strategic update going to slide where you sort of lay out very nicely the transformation over the last years as we look forward over the next three to five years i was wondering if you can help fill in the blanks around strategically ma has been a key pillar of this transformation as we think about both organic and inorganic one on the ma side give us a sense of just where you see dealmaking happening over the next few years we saw a big private asset deal being announced on friday and so would love some perspective there morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 and then i think the second thing you mentioned in terms of wallet share on the investment banking side if we can unpack that a little bit in terms of how you expect to achieve a greater wallet share thank you edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley thanks good to talk to you with you its an interesting question youre effectively asking what will the slide look like three four years from now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yes edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley we believe that the revenue mix will toggle around there could be periods like in or where the investment bank is really firing on all cylinders again early economy type of activity and that could grow again towards and we could have other periods where as we continue to invest in the wealth and investment management piece of the firm that could expand further i think where we are right now is a revenue and profitability matter where of the firm is in wealth and investment management is not a bad place to start i think the main message id want to convey today is that while theres a change in leadership after years of james stewardship theres not a change in strategy we have undertaken and integrated if you really go back into time and then include mesa west five different acquisitions and i think the view inside the house is thats good for now we can execute our business with the growth plans in front of us and it feels organic now that having been said there are ideas that come across the transom and we naturally would take a look but i think for the next period the view that i would have is that we really work to grow the organization and to do so organically and efficiently i think on the margin one comment might be that we could work on sweating the income statement a bit more there is little more work to be done postintegration where there could be inefficiencies ph along the income statement and i think we are much focused on looking for those efficiencies without giving up any of the strategic investment that we want to make on our way to pbt margins in wealth and efficiency of the firm the way ive articulated the strategic goals is to effectively reiterate we will achieve those goals but along the way we will invest and that investment opportunity exists on the current portfolio in an exciting way and that is why for me the most important message we want to send out to folks today was this concept of the integrated firm now we have the portfolio of businesses together we have a unified partnership culture we have the two halves of the firm itll toggle by or points on revenue or profitability given a period of time and now we can scale that organically and hit the numbers and work the income statement a little bit operator well move to our next question from steven chubak with wolfe research your line is now open morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley hi steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so want hey wanted to start off ted and sharon with just a question on incremental margins and comp leverage in a lower rate backdrop we know nii is going to be a source of drag in the coming quarters certainly if the forward curve manifests but fees should see improved momentum from equity market tailwinds stronger fee based flows a better ib backdrop but the street is modeling comp dollars flat revenues up about billion im just trying to get a sense as to how we should think about incremental margins as revenue momentum improves but the growth is coming admittedly from more compensable areas sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley so you obviously did hit the nail on the head in terms of the different pieces right so you cant look at the different line items the same way youre going to have a comp ratio change as fas get compensated as you would expect on the grid associated with those feebased revenues as it relates to nii yes that was non compensable as i just told you the expectation on a quarteroverquarter basis if client behavior remains unchanged you are sitting in a position where youre beginning to better understand what that behavior is and that nii will be roughly in line with where it was in the fourth quarter at least for the first quarter so yes the comp itself might change but the actual growth in the ability to see the feebased assets grow is higher there are also other offsetting factors that we have to think about as we look back into the last year remember that what i highlighted was you had negative implications associated with mix of revenue in those asset management lines because of the fact that we saw investors invest in fixed income products you had market dynamics associated with billing et cetera so there is place are rather places that you can see growth in the asset management line yes they will be compensable but we would see benefits of scale both from the asset side and hopefully from the market side as you see different pieces being invested as you move forward i hope that helps to frame the answer to your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah thats really helpful and just for my followup i was hoping you could just speak to the sensitivity to lower rates its a big area of focus for investors you benefit from having the majority of your deposits in premium savings where admittedly you have a bit of pricing flexibility at the same time the asset side is still very sensitive to the short end so wanted to get a sense as to how you expect the nii trajectory to unfold as the fed begins easing and whether theres any appetite on your side to extend durations maybe lock in some higher yields sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 its a great question and the answer is fully premised on what we see first with deposits right so your sort of first order condition as you look ahead into is what happens to the deposit mix what i said on the call is that were encouraged in my prepared remarks were encouraged by what weve seen todate as of the beginning of the january if you were to assume that that were to hold the next question is what is the pace of the interest rate cuts that we see if you see an instantaneous shock we disclosed to you what that means right so an instantaneous basis point shock lower will be negative around million right however if it was more gradual in nature which is similar to what you might see in a forward curve you will have offsets associated with the reinvestment of the portfolio so that will offset the rate decline right will largely offset those rate declines but it will depend first order condition is are deposits stable is the mix stable and thats what weve seen so far so lets see if that holds and then second what is the pace of the cuts over the course of the year operator well move to our next question from devin ryan with jmp securities your line is now open please go ahead devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc yeah thanks so much and good morning ted and sharon sharon maybe just to start with a question on investment banking and good to hear about the tone improvement there sponsors have been less active than corporates at least from the data we track and we know sponsors have record dry powder but higher interest rates current valuations have been a little bit challenging for them so just the question is whether they are in a position to return in force over the next year i think thats probably going to be necessary for full normalization in investment banking and then just what youre seeing when you talk about the pipelines that you have which are good what are sponsors doing in those pipelines thanks sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley sure overall the pipeline is more diversified than weve necessarily seen in historical years we expect to see continued momentum in energy that weve seen over the past year we see optimistic signs in real estate and we see optimistic signs in technology as it relates to sponsors we would expect sponsors to come back that will obviously take time and i do think it will likely take a couple of potential prints in certain places and other things that will be encouraging will be on the equity ipo side what id say is we moved from a period of time that was windowdriven and that market is beginning to build momentum and so the juxtaposition between the outlook for i think in is important there as well devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay terrific and then a question for ted so i think youre pretty clear here the strategic trajectory is not changing dramatically but we often get the question around stylistically whats changing and so you have a different background than james and i think everyone has their own management style and youve run some big businesses very successfully for morgan stanley so want to maybe just hit on briefly how you would characterize kind of your style and just the ability to leverage your experience and what may change as a result of that thanks edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 well id say thats a great question james and i are much more similar than not he brings to the table a positive mojo to the business from the time that he took over as ceo when things were in as you know pretty rough shape and for now in his 15th year of leadership as exec chair he brings that positive spirit to every single interaction that we have whether its our operating and management committees our risk meetings these calls client interactions cultural work with our newbies and folks that are looking to get promoted in the organization i think that spirit of positivity is something that has been contagious in the organization its something that im a big believer in and has worked well inside of the trading businesses inside of investment banking and i think you can feel it throughout the firm so the reaffirmation of our partnership our core values and this articulation of the integrated firm which is the next step now because we went from trying to build our way back to generating the kind of enhanced scale and deeper moats through these gutsy acquisitions that brought us to a place now where we can look around and see how we can bring the firm closely together i think the tone is one of determination ive been at this place for more than three decades and we had our moment sort of before the abyss in and i think its fair to say that the entire senior partnership james but also the folks that came to the organization like myself we are determined to not revisit anything that feels like those days so the calling card here is durability is consistency we want to put up consistent results part of what you see in the strategic deck in the back on back page those are very clear numbers and we will hit them well hit those numbers it will take time we will have to do all of the three yards and a cloud of dust work associated with thoughtfully working our way to those numbers such that when we hit them in a normalized environment which will be part of the next arrow on page in the years to come we will have done so in a way where we can achieve full valuation on it because the view will be that they are not only achieved for a moment in time but sustainable and that obviously is also the calling card of james tenure which is that of consistency and durability so if the first is this positive mojo and a second is this ethos of consistency rigor durability i think the third at the end of the day has been to believe in what morgan stanley can aspire to for clients and that is this integrated firm that we are something differentiated in our two channels very clear in what we do and what we dont do and that the cycles very much a tailwind for us operator well move to our next question from christian bolu with autonomous research your line is now open please go ahead christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning ted and welcome to the call good morning sharon as well maybe ted for you on the trading businesses morgan stanley has suffered some share loss over the last couple of years and your peers have been aggressively allocating capital to that business and gaining share so maybe curious of how youre thinking about opportunities to grow those businesses and any plans to either invest more capital or resources into that business edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 thanks for the question christian good to hear your voice i think we know that we have we have achieved the top three position in the institutional securities business over the last number of years but as you say on the margin we have lost share to the number one and number two and i think our view has been that that is a trade that weve been willing to make both to continue to toggle the organization to the kind of revenue and profitability mix that you see today but also importantly the preservation of capital which allows us today irrespective of where we are in basel iii endgame to have a cet1 ratio that is well above as youve heard i am with the team much focused on the durability of the dividend and so theres been real focus on what shareholders want and what the business model ought to be for folks that want a durable morgan stanley now that having been said what you saw in was that we can be quite agile about getting capital resourcing to the client base if the tailwinds are there part of the proposition of being a global investment bank is that if for example balances start working in the prime brokerage context towards their highs where were about away from those figures well then perhaps capital needs to be put towards equities namely the prime brokerage business in behalf of clients there may be other periods where the events space which was an allusion made on the previous question with respect to activity around financial sponsors that that activity may come back because of course at some point these large assets need to trade and the sponsor community is dependent at some level on the street to engage in velocity so there is no strategic decision at all to withdraw from the investment bank i think what we would say in is that there its not really a choice between wealth and investment management or the institutional securities business we will engage in both activities but we will not be looking to chase the ball simply to have wallet share the name of the game is to have an income statement that demonstrates operating leverage in each of the two businesses and ultimately to get to a holistic return so we are much focused on what the durability of that capital put to use is and where we can serve clients over a long period of time were paying attention to it very carefully and what im most excited about christian is that the cycle thats coming the investment bankingled cycle is coming at a time when we spent years putting together and i know youve met some of these folks our socalled integrated investment bank what is differentiated about this place is that we have bankers equities people and fixed income folks who work together they work together on client solutions what im proposing on our behalf is now we extend that proposition to the firm where in the wealth business the investment management business and inside the investment bank we can work together around clients ultimately to generate operating leverage and returns and that is for me the most exciting part of the next chapter which is weve got the team weve got the excess capital but again i like the excess capital because its part of what has differentiated us from the group and allows us to weather whatever comes through on a basel iii endgame i would add if in fact the basel iii endgame outcome is more favorable than perhaps what the street expects we will adjust accordingly but we have tools and part of thats the dividend part of thats investing in the business part of that obviously is buying stock back but ultimately having a real capital cushion is something that shareholders have come to expect from james and thats something they should continue to expect from me christian bolu q analyst autonomous research us lp awesome very clear ted thank you morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 and then maybe a another one on wealth management margins unfortunately maybe for sharon i kind of hear you sharon very clearly that you think higher revenues will drive margins over time but i guess but if i guess if i look at the business versus today wealth management revenues are up versus where they were in but your margins have compressed and again i know theres onetime items in the quarter or in the year but it doesnt seem to me like bigger revenues have driven operating leverage so what gives you confidence that going forward revenue growth will drive meaningful operating leverage sharon yeshaya a executive vice president chief financial officer morgan stanley really around the conversion thats why i keep talking about the conversion christian we brought the statistics up last year weve brought the statistics up again this year in terms of seeing conversion from workplace about seeing net new assets coming in and then seeing those assets migrate new clients giving fas time all of those things are able to give us more durable asset managementbased revenue as we move forward so to your question and i think steve asked a similar question the nii will fluctuate obviously based on rates and on consumer and customer behavior and so the goal while that has been something that we we say dont forget the bank dont forget the margin youll get from that over time the goal is to have a more sustainable trillion dollars of assets coming through both wealth and investment management those assets will earn fees to some portion of it and we see the migration into feebased right we have of advisorled assets sitting in feebased accounts thats the ultimate proposition from seeing an expanded margin and seeing the benefits of scale and we have invested in workplace weve invested in getting new channels and getting new participants the time is now to begin to see conversion and we have evidence factual evidence that i pointed to on this call to show you that were making progress towards those goals edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley what id add christian is again all goals being equally important we will hit that trillion number so part of it is to allow for some of this latency if you will on assets held away on assets working their way through workplace its a space that we are a leader in its a space that is relatively embryonic in the wealth business and we will allow for some time for those assets to convert but the key of course is to have them inhouse and then as well to see that folks who are new workplace customers have assets held away in other existing brokerage accounts that they bring them to the firm as well operator operator instructions our next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs please go ahead your line is now open brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning and congrats to ted on the new role since i only get one shot at this i will ask on the longterm targets so there were some slight changes here we lost some pluses and we lost a ph less than on the efficiency ratio although in fairness we gained a plus on the client assets so was that a reflection of these are longterm targets so im guessing its not really a reflection of the current environment so what drove the tweak there to maybe signal some reduction in some of the upside scenarios morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 and how youve referenced the fact that you need the environment to normalize how should we be thinking about progression towards these targets and what specific nonenvironmental actions you can be taking in order to move the ball there edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley yes excellent question and a lot of time given to consideration on pluses and the like this for me was sort of an easy call the page is one that we all own and getting to margins is a number that we want to achieve and at that level having hit something that is approaching trillion assets were going to be in a really great place and that would be a reasonable time to say hey how about more and we would say okay well clearly were going to continue to grow assets because the asset number way that tam is is gigantic james has mentioned that trillion at one point there are client assets that will keep us busy for many generations to come whether the pretax margin of wealth should go above at that point before or not id like to get to the and i want to get there durably and thoughtfully and the mid is a range that youve seen us trade at the business to work well at and we believe we can when economic conditions normalize as sharon has described and as new assets get put to work some combination of money markets and tbills coming into the market again workplace coming through the funnel all three channels working on the back of increased transaction activity and new issues and the like we should slowly and durably work our way back to the efficiency ratio as you know is just another way of saying margins for the enterprise now by definition the investment bank which has more capital and more underlying risk should have margins that exceed over time so its fair to say that if were hitting margins in wealth management we certainly should be at an enterprise efficiency ratio of minus as well so the 30plus could be a way of thinking about it but i wanted to set up numbers where the team knew that they are specific and that we needed to hit them and then finally with respect to returns on capital this gets to the importance of our being stewards of that capital what we pay out in the form of dividends what we buy back and durably how we run the place so we thought that rotce which is something we hit during the covid years but of course those were against macroeconomic conditions which were unusual and highly favorable that we can do in a normalized environment so this may be on the margin and james liked it too when we talked about it stylistically my view was and the team shares it that trillion of client assets we should get there and just keep on going but the other three effectively in removing the pluses its simply reaffirming that those numbers will be hit we will hit pretax margins in wealth efficiency ratio for the firm and rotce it will take time there will be the challenges you would expect in making that happen and of course we need economic conditions to line up in a favorable way but over time those are the firmwide goals and we wanted to be very specific about that for you operator well take our last question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead your line is now open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi ted morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc can you hear me edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley nice ink enjoyed the story mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay well it looks like you have a heavy lift after following james gormans ph true path what is your message to the wealth managers and investment managers that half of the company that you havent run in the past so youve proven yourself in the half of the company thats clearly capital markets and wall street banking but whats your message to the other half of the company at a time when theyve had a stepdown in their growth rates new asset flows on wealth and outflows in investment management edward n pick a chief executive officer director morgan stanley well thanks for the question mike the wealth business is actually in my blood my dad and my fatherinlaw were both brokers once upon a time and i grew up studying that business as a kid and i think it is absolutely that which has differentiated morgan stanley during this 15year period the ability to integrate smith barney and build out something that is truly special has been existentially as you know better than most but also thematically exactly what the firm has needed in no way has it actually worked to the disbenefit of the investment bank as you know the history of our merger from was largely about social issues but the industrial idea wasnt necessarily off at all to build a worldclass wealth manager would be something that would have enormous barriers to entry and if run well and run in a firstclass way could deliver value to clients in a differentiated manner and what we have done thanks to the leadership of andy saperstein with jed finn and then in the investment management business with dan simkowitz now moving over to investment bank and ben huneke and jacques chappuis running investment management today is weve got effectively the full funnel weve got the soup to nuts selfdirected the traditional advisory channel and this new channel workplace working as one ive spent time working some of the chairmens and hitting a branch here in midtown and spending some time with folks that are actually making the engine work and i think its fair to say that we at one point were calling the wealth and investment management business the ballast which was the right word because we wanted to convey durability but id submit to you mike and hopefully youll appreciate the spirit in which i say this i think its actually the engine i think this will be the engine for further morgan stanley growth if opportunities were to come before us in the years to come of course we could staple them on and do something inorganically as james alluded to perhaps that would be outside the us where ive spent a whole bunch of time but in running the actual organic business as it currently stands we are truly a group of one and as you know having spent time inside the knitting of ms what were most excited about mike you as a student morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q4 earnings call 16jan2024 of corporate culture and these investment banks i think what you would be most excited about is just how well we all get along there is zero friction in the leadership ranks across infrastructure across wealth and investment management and across the investment bank so the beauty of where we are today is that all of us the shareholders and custodians of the morgan stanley idea and the morgan stanley culture of firstclass business in a firstclass way are very much focused on growing both pieces of the firm and this leading wealth and asset manager has a lot more room and will grow as i said to the trillion of assets and at the same time i dont see any reason why we cant continue to pick up high quality durable wallet inside the investment bank and generate operating leverage in that business too operator that concludes our questionandanswer session for today ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays
