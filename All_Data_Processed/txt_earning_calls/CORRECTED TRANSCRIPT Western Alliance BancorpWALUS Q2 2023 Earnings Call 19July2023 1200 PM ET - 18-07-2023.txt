results in more detail before opening the call for qa our chief credit officer tim bruckner as miles said is here with us as well in many ways this quarter represented a transitional period for western alliance following the events of ph midmarch as our firm and our clients increasingly returned to a sense of normalcy we continue to successfully execute on the balance sheet repositioning strategy we laid out last quarter we exceeded our liquidity guidance by growing deposits by billion and repaying over billion in shortterm borrowings for the second quarter wal generated total net revenues of million net income of million and eps of we maintained strong profitability with return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively which grew tangible book value per share by to or yearoveryear and will continue to support building capital levels in the quarters to come we achieved significant progress on the immediate and shortterm objectives identified last quarter to establish a sound foundation for wal to sustain ongoing client and financial success notably deposits grew billion and exceeded our billion quarterly guidance growth was diversified across business lines and included brisk core deposit growth from new and returning customers net liquidity growth of billion allowed us to significantly reduce highercost wholesale borrowing wal continues to expeditiously execute our balance sheet repositioning strategy and completed billion of total asset dispositions in q2 which included billion of loan dispositions ahead of the billion outlined in q1 meaningful deposit growth and asset dispositions lowered wals loanto deposit ratio to and allowed us to rapidly reduce reliance on highercost fhlb borrowings by billion over the quarter im proud to report core deposits have rebounded another billion quartertodate meaning wals deposit levels are now million above our yearend balance western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 cet1 capital of increased from on march and or basis points since q3 when we initially announced the banks capital building initiatives through organic capital generation without equity issuance finally we continue to focus on meeting our core client banking needs in order to cultivate strong long term relationships leveraging third party products to significantly grow reciprocal deposits has lifted our insured and collateralized deposit levels to one of the highest among large us banks as we move through the back half of the year we believe bank investors will place more emphasis on balance sheet strength stressing the fundamentals of growing indiscernible improve liquidity deposit cost composition and granularity stable asset quality moderate and thoughtful loan growth and producing predictable and sustainable ppnr the banks diversified funding strategy continue to focus on growing attractive funds from a diverse set of clients and channels in order to prioritize repayment of the more expensive wholesale funding sources and then to optimize deposit balances from lower cost sources to deploy into superior riskadjusted lending opportunities as we have done historically driving the billion deposit growth was significant new and returning customer activity throughout western alliance in q2 we attracted billion from approximately new and returning commercial relationships at an attractive average total deposit cost of with notable contributions from mortgage warehouse regional banking and settlement services over million of netnew deposit money was in noninterest bearing dda our commitment to foster multiproduct customer relationships has been the key to onboarding new deposits in a very competitive environment additionally we will utilize other diversified sources of deposits to accelerate repayment of wholesale borrowings and return to prudent lending our recently launched online consumer channel is demonstrating steady progress providing another source of uncorrelated liquidity and generated approximately million this quarter at attractive rates compared to the marginal costs of repaid borrowing going forward continued deposit channel optimization and growth and new and returning core client commercial relationships will lower the proportion of funds generated from brokered cd indiscernible now dale will take you through our financials dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks ken for the quarter western alliance generated net income of million eps of and pre provision net revenue of million net interest income decreased million during the quarter to million mostly from elevated higher costs to return borrowings that were materially reduced near quarterend q2s net interest income should be considered a trough with q3 and q4 levels indiscernible non interest income increased to million from an adjusted level of million in the second quarter as a reminder loans marked in q1 in a net loss million as part of our balance sheet repositioning efforts are responsible for negative fee income last quarter on a reported basis on an operating basis noninterest income was million higher from q1 the green shoots we cited with mortgage last quarter were evident again in the second quarter as amerihome revenue increased million to million we remain cautiously optimistic as continued stabilization improving margins and profitability momentum is sustainable as amerihome capitalizes on the exit of a major competitor from the correspondent funding channel earlier this year production margins went closer to normalized levels of basis points as the industry rationalized and win rates continue to improve other noninterest expense growth was driven by higher insurance costs related to elevated insured and brokered deposit levels which also include core reciprocal deposits above a certain threshold provision expense of million is indicative of a return to a more normalized credit environment we remain conservative on macro assumptions and as a commercial bank the outlook for commercial real estate is a key driver that informs our provisioning our allowance for credit losses modelling western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 assumes an likelihood of a recession using moodys analytics scenarios a lower tax rate was beneficial to earnings this quarter and we expect to go forward with a normalized rate as an average of the last two we made substantial progress in our balance sheet repositioning and surgical asset disposition efforts in the second quarter to accelerate higher capital and liquidity building these dispositions complemented our organic earnings and contributed approximately basis points of incremental cet1 capital billion of asset dispositions were completed including loan sales of runoffs primarily in equity fund resources syndicated loans and mortgage warehouse businesses the equity fund resource creditlinked note was also fully unwound loans held for investment increased billion to billion deposits increased billion which brought balances to billion at quarterend mortgage servicing rights balances of billion rose during the quarter total borrowings were reduced by billion to billion due mostly to paydowns in federal home loan bank borrowings in march remaining efr creditlinked note was also fully redeemed we completed the unwind of ph million of clns yeartodate the positive momentum has continued into the third quarter as deposits are billion higher from june total heldforinvestment loan growth of billion consisted of million of organic loan growth primarily for mortgage warehouse regional banking divisions and resort finance improved liquidity from deposit growth well in excess of loan growth allowed us to reclassify million of heldforsale loans back to heldforinvestment which will improve the companys return profile deposit growth of billion resulted from remixing the deposit base into interestbearing dda from savings and money markets as well as cd growth from client promotions and brokered cds noninterest bearing ddas comprise a third of our total deposit mix with approximately half having no cash payment or earnings credits turning now to our net interest drivers the securities portfolio grew billion to billion as we look to bolster our highquality liquid asset balances yield expanded at basis points to largely from floating rate maturities benefiting from higher rates we continue to benefit from higher reinvestment rates as approximately billion of securities are expected to mature in the second half of this year and million additionally in the spot rate for the entire portfolio was at quarterend heldforinvestment loans increased million and the portfolio yield increased basis points to at quarterend the spot rate was interestbearing deposit cost rose basis points to or a billion increase to billion the elevated cost resulted from a higher interest rate environment which offset indiscernible noninterestbearing demand deposit growth total cost of funding rose basis points to from higher utilization of wholesale borrowings with an average cost of billion of these borrowings were repaid which produced a billion difference between average and endof period balances optimizing the funding mix with more core and reciprocal deposits in conjunction with the billion of federal home loan bank paydowns which occur later in the quarter positions us for improving funding cost to support our net interest margin guidance moving down further into our funding base we have actively utilized reciprocal deposit channels to drive growth and provide greater insurance coverage to larger depositors of brokered deposits consist of sticky reciprocal deposits we believe these core client relationships have been fortified through this product enhancement making them exceptionally stable overall net interest income decreased approximately million or over the prior quarter which should compress net interest margin and averageearning assets declining million mostly stemming from balance sheet repositioning actions net interest margin compressed basis points to with a higher interest expense from outsized higher cost borrowings as excess liquidity is generated with deposit growth greater than loan growth and non amerihome heldforsales are liquidated we expect pay down additional repo lines costing sofr plus and should contribute to funding cost tailwinds the effect of these dynamics can start to be seen in the expansion of western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 the june nim to our efficiency ratio of improved by about basis points from the second quarter though our adjusted efficiency ratio increased to from in the prior quarter higher insurance costs from elevated brokered and insured deposits as well as lower net interest income from increased interest expense were the main reasons for this change we still view mid to upper adjusted efficiency as the right level and expect expenses to align with our core run rate of revenue as we look to optimize additional work streams throughout the bank preprovision net revenue was million during the quarter solid profitability was sustained with the q2 return on average assets at and return on average tangible common equity of strong ppnr provides capital flexibility to absorb provision expense and credit losses if warranted while still growing the balance sheet and attaining higher cet1 capital levels given the increased attention on the commercial real estate sector were providing additional details on our cre investor and office portfolios as well as our overall early identification and elevation credit mitigation strategy as this proactive migration approach has historically produced lower loss to margins our cre investor underwriting strategy rests on the foundation of low loanto cost underwriting in some markets where we have deep experience and strong financial sponsors as a reminder our financing structures carry no junior liens or mezzanine debt which enables maximum flexibility in working with clients and sponsors we have low uncovered tail risk as of the portfolio has ltvs below and these ltvs are based upon the most recent appraisals and assuming commitments are fully funded within commercial real estate office accounts for just of total loans we have previously discussed our focus on shorterterm bridge loans and repositioning office projects in suburban areas our exposure in indiscernible central business district areas that we believe are most vulnerable to work from home risk are minimal at just of office loans we have redesignated some midterm exposure away from the cbd classifications because in our view dynamics in these markets make them less susceptible to work from home risk versus larger cities for example we do not have cbd office loans in new york boston chicago atlanta houston or dallas looking at ltvs youll notice only of office has an or greater loantovalue and aligns with our central business district exposure we primarily focus on indemand class a to b office properties and of class a properties have ltvs below the entire office book carries an ltv of finally we are not facing a large maturity and wals approximately threequarters of loans come due in or later turning to asset quality trends in light of the unprecedented environment and due to the sharp increase in interest rates over the past months we have completed a proactive comprehensive review of our commercial real estate portfolio which is reflected in loan migrations this quarter this is part of our early identification and early elevation credit mitigation strategy and has served us well we proactively move loans into special mention when cash flow may be curtailed in the present environment despite having wellsupported collateral values and indiscernible sponsorship remains strong in the loans still current we do this to ensure attention and monitoring at the highest levels within our credit organization as we require the sponsors to remargin the loan to establish indiscernible cash reserves to support a cash rating this is an important element of our credit control process an established process for more than years as a result of these efforts special mention loans increased to million or of funded loans with million or twothirds of migration coming from offices and hotels classified assets increased million a basis points of total assets half of the increase in classified assets was driven by ph one million office loan in downtown san diego which makes up the preponderance of the central business district office exposure i mentioned we dont anticipate meaningful losses as this property is leased current appraisal exceeds the outstanding loan amount and all cash flow will go to pay down this credit western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 our proactive identification and resolution process results in lower realized losses over the last years less than of special mention loans have become losses and within commercial real estate investor property less than basis points of special mention loans have migrated to loss when looking at the next two slides youll see the results of our early identification and elevation negotiation resolution process has resulted in bestofclass loss rates over the last years the rest of western alliance is about the process which sometimes produces earlier criticized and classified designations but at the end of the day leads to low net chargeoffs on average were ranked in the top third among asset peers for adverselygraded loans as a percentage of total loans and hold the best ranking on losses the difference between our ranking on adverselygraded loans compared to our number one position of historical credit losses highlights the success of our proactive credit mitigation strategy quarterly net loan chargeoffs were million or basis points of average loans compared to net loan charge offs of million or basis points in the first quarter our total loan acl rose almost million from the prior quarter to million due to higher provisioning and low loan loss rates total loan allowance for credit losses to funded loans increased basis point to basis points in q1 but is basis points when loans covered by credit linked notes are excluded the allowance was for nonperforming loans at the end of the quarter we feel wellpositioned in an uncertain economic environment based on the business transformation since the global financial crisis our loan portfolio is diversified across risk segments with almost a quarter it of either credit protected governmentguaranteed or cashsecured and over half of the portfolio is either insured or resistant to economic volatility these percentages align with weightings reported before we embarked on our balance sheet repositioning initiative late in the first quarter of note our lower average loss grades in the resilient and more sensitive categories are indicative of conservative underwriting and highly responsive remediation actions we discussed reprioritizing building capital back to premerger levels in our q3 earnings call since then cet1 capital has grown from to and is up over basis points since the first quarter our tangible common equity to total assets rose basis points from the first quarter to we remain committed to achieving a medium term cet1 target of which we view as prudent considering the heightened regulatory tension regarding appropriate capital levels we also expect increased excess capital will provide more financial and strategic optionality in the future looking at the strong combination of insured deposits and high capital to make depositors comfortable with the stability of their financial institution western alliance has materially moved its insured deposit levels to among the highest in the nation compared to the largest banks capital has also lifted into the top third even adjusting for fair value marks in both the availableforsale and held tomaturity securities portfolios inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend which came in at per share our tangible book value per share increased in the quarter to western alliances compelling longterm tangible book value per share divergence from peers remains intact this increased over six times that of the peer group since the end of which equates to a compound annual growth rate of nearly ph amidst economic cycles and market disruptions this outperformance is still four times that of peers when adding common dividends back ill now hand the call back to ken to conclude with closing comments kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale our guidance for the rest of continues to be driven by the strategies and priorities laid out in our prior earnings call let me tell you what you could expect from here western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 regarding capital having exceeded our immediate cet1 target of in q2 we expect continued although more gradual growth in our capital ratios with a mediumterm cet1 ratio target of in this will be driven by our continued strong return on average tangible common equity and capital generation core deposits are expected to grow at approximately billion per quarter and exceed more muted loan growth by approximately billion this will lower our loantodeposit ratio over time towards a mid80 target net interest margin is expected to rise modestly from our q2 trough of and land in the range of to for the second half of based on our successful repayment of borrowings this past quarter and the cost of new deposit indiscernible our efficiency ratio excluding the impact of deposit costs should decline slightly to the high given the reduced borrowing costs and higher asset yields asset quality remains manageable as it returns to more normalized levels we expect credit losses to be to basis points through the economic cycle overall for the second half of we expect quarterly operating ppnr to remain consistent to q3 results and begin to climb as we exit the year as we continue to reposition the balance sheet and continue to reestablish our core deposit and loan growth trajectory we see western alliance as an even better institution and wellpositioned for the future we view our earnings performance being driven by balance sheet growth improving margins and efficiency along with continuous strengthening in our mortgage operations that should result in quarterly operating ppnr consistent to q2 results and then grow thereafter at this time dale and tim and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question will be from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp good morning ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc i was curious if we could i mean im sure were going to get a lot of questions on credit because deposits seem to have cleared themselves up but if we could just take a moment to kind of just walk through the guidance a little bit further i was curious on what are you guys assuming for just average earning assets for the back half of the year with that margin guide and it seems like you already have that spread difference of plus billion per quarter which gives you billion in deposits and then on loans its plus billion so you already have that billion essentially now can we see the paydown of debt pretty immediate in the third quarter or do you think its a bit more granular throughout the second half of the year western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well we still have a couple of billion dollars that fund our billion that we have in our heldforsale loans with repo relationships with another commercial bank and those loans and those funds we have borrowed from them cost us sofr plus basis points so paying that down with some of the liquidity we bring in is going to help improve our net interest income but doesnt really change earning assets but in addition to that we do expect that a portion of these dollars we bring in are going to be used to provide new credit opportunities to our clients and so its going to be a combination of the two so im looking for earning assets to continue to climb but not as fast as the deposit growth benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay thats helpful and then if we could just take a moment to think just kind of holistically about credit here it seems like you got a decent amount of npl increases and the reserve was essentially the same up a modest uptick so with creditlinked notes being a little bit less of importance now that weve kind of had a strategic repositioning how do we think about the allowance going forward in terms of like a gaap percentage relative to the loans dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well a couple of things i mean in terms of what the ratio is i think its really important to note how much what our chargeoffs have been and why that number may be ph screams lower relative to other institutions we dont have consumer loans which have a constant burn rate of losses and in addition i mentioned the moodys scenario as well so we took of their consensus forecast that has two consecutive quarters third quarter and fourth quarter this year of a recession in it and then we took with it an s4 which is the severe recession whereby you are seeing contraction in commercial real estate values in excess of whats important about that is because were a low advance rate lender even with significant reductions in terms of valuation we still dont incur losses because our borrower still has skin in the game they still have equity that they want to protect and theyre still willing to negotiate with us in terms of how we can come to a solution set together so its really ph if we lend it out at a much higher rate we wouldnt be in that position but because of our low advance rate thats been really key to our strong asset quality kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp but if youre asking a question about the provisioning going forward i would say its about in the same vicinity going forward as q2s provisioning for q3 and q4 benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you thats very helpful color great to see you guys go from defense to offense so quickly appreciate the color guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 operator thank you the next question will be from the line of casey haire with jefferies your line is now open casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah great thanks good morning guys just want to follow up on the borrowing paydown so just you guys have a ppnr guide of around million what you have here in the second quarter just wondering the pace of what the guide assumes for borrowing paydown and timing as well like how low does that billion go dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i dont have a number for you casey exactly what i would say is were trying to do two things here one is pay down further particularly the more expensive line as i mentioned but secondly as well to provide more liquidity for our clients so the combination of those two i dont have a number in terms of what exactly that looks like but thats the trajectory were on thats the trajectory we started to be on in the second quarter and i think were going to be more focused on that as we ph complete casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay and given the progress you guys have made on the deposits quartertodate which is pretty strong has there been any paydown quartertodate and youre making use of that deposit growth like do you have a borrowing balance as of july 17th kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah this is ken yeah we do let me just take you to the deposits yeah were seeing great deposit growth so far early into the quarter to remind everyone thats the natural flow of our deposits they grow early and just about in the next couple of days were going to see some paydowns coming from our warehouse lending group for pi and ph di accounts and so those deposits will shrink okay so for us we have the borrowings scheduled to be paid down probably closer to the backend of the quarter as a safer way of thinking about it as we grow our deposits to billion we actually hope we can do better but as we grow our deposit growth to billion casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just i guess switching to the dispositions about billion left so apologies if i missed this but can you get that done this quarter and within the original fair value mark of that you took dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp weve updated our marks we think that theyre good what we did initially i think proved to be pretty accurate i dont think its all going to get done this quarter but we expect to make kind of significant progress on that and as i mentioned that will be coincident with paying down higher cost indiscernible western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay dale any color on whats causing the delay because i mean whats left has not worked like a lot of high risk stuff for you guys timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp hi tim bruckner yeah were actually receiving much stronger values on some of these ph undiscrete single note sales related to some of the assets and adjusted to the normal course that takes a little bit longer ph they do at a large pool sale kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp i just wanted to indiscernible casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks for the question casey but we were pretty early in moving assets to hfs and i think our aggressive posturing of that helped us keep the dispositions inside of our ph locks and thats sort of the hallmark and the culture here at the company and which connects to the asset quality that were approach that we take as well so we tend to be early on everything and trying to execute early on we have found whether its disposition of assets whether its asset quality in talking to clients being there early being there first produces better results so i just wanted to add that little color commentary casey haire q analyst jefferies llc great thanks guys operator thank you the next question will be from the line of bernard vongizycki with deutsche bank your line is now open bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah hi good morning so on slide of your presentation you showed some nice detail on the growth drivers of that billion of deposits during the quarter it looks like as you mentioned in your prepared remarks about billion in core deposit growth with the new and returning client deposits and existing client net growth so thats about onethird returning funds and twothirds new money so if that mix is right is this the type of mix between new money and returning money you would expect say over the next few quarters and potentially improve over time and maybe if you could give us a sense what that mix was for the billion you noted quartertodate western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp regarding where the funds have come from i think that there are some clients that were really waiting for our second quarter results wanted to make sure that the noise related to q1 had cleared ph there were never kind of financial institution failures during this kind of interim period and so i think we have a strong ability to pull in funds indiscernible in the nearterm from some of the returning clients that of course will diminish over time when theres less funds to return to begin with but at the same time we can ph gen up again some of our deposit business lines which were a little hamstrung after what happened in with silicon valley bank so some of the initiatives particularly in settlement services and our corporate trust operation clients gave pause after seeing what had happened to that institution and so thats not new thats not old money returning but that is an acceleration of new opportunity kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i would take that question and just maybe add a little bit different perspective or observations which is the march disruption really disrupted our pipeline going forward and we have a very very strong pipeline in business escrow services in corporate trust i should say corporate trust was a developing pipeline but really in settlement services and so the disruption in march actually disrupted our pipeline were seeing that pipeline reappear stronger as dale said a lot of people wanted to wait until we were announcing our quarterly earnings i think that will make people feel comfortable and we have some great deal of comfort on that pipeline returning which gives us comfort to the billion guide that weve put out there for deposit growth so i think what youll see is besides the regions which are seeing healthy deposit growth and also led by bridge bank and our tech and innovation space it will see growth come for the rest of the year in the business escrow services in settlement services in hoa by the way those are three standalone deposit channels which we have been developing over the past couple of years and also in our online consumer platform as well bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thanks for that color just as a followup im just wondering i believe a big chunk of the deposit growth was also in cds just curious how far are you going on say some of the promotional pricing given you and the industry are leading with rates paid just given the current environment just trying to get a sense of how much of these balances can be sticky or how can you deepen the relationship so these deposits do become sticky dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean on the broker element i wouldnt call those sticky however i would call them cheaper so what we borrow from some of these credit lines as well as from the federal home loan bank are at those rates are higher than the brokered cd channel in addition to that brokered cds do not consume liquidity opportunities so if we borrow we have a credit line that is over billion from the federal home loan bank but as you borrow against it you have less availability to bring in broker deposits it costs less and it leaves that availability open so this is something were going to wean ourselves down from over time but youre not going to see a chopoff during the third quarter but all the guide that ken mentioned that we have in terms of our deposit growth prospectively does not assume any growth for deposit increases from where we were at june 30th western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 bernard vongizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great thanks for taking my questions operator thank you the next question will be from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan your line is now open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi everybody i wanted to start and drill down a little bit into the billion youre calling out through july 17th whats the rough composition of that are those more new and returning client funds ph you used any brokered in there and very roughly whats the cost so far kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp as it relates to the composition very little is coming from the brokered cd channel as dale mentioned its actually zero whether youre seeing it come from is all warehouse lending and no financing group which generally builds up in the early parts of the month and then paid down towards the third week and then restarts its build process in the fourth week so youre seeing those funds come in generally theyre noninterestbearing deposits they do carry ecr credits which were seeing in the operating expense we also are showing very early on signs of a very strong hoa deposit build as well so primarily thats where the funds are coming from dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp and i think theres also been some repatriation from our debt group we did have losses from that in march and those dollars are up monthtodate as well kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i think dale brings an important point up on the tech group theres been a lot of disruption with the demise of svb there and our brand bridge is a steady consistent player in that market and what youre seeing is a lot of disruption with clients with former people that have worked at svb and their new companies establishing their operating processes and credit policies now that has all been established for us and people know our players and they know the type of bank we are and i think thats going to lead to more deposit growth out of bridge which is going to support your overall regional deposit growth as we move forward steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats helpful im curious in terms of the deposit thats left in the aftermath of sivb what rough percentage would you say have returned is it like is it a material percentage at this point and then what are you hearing from one the customers returning dale i think you mentioned they were waiting to see your numbers but then for the customers that havent returned what are you hearing from them why they havent returned yet western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so yeah i mean im going to say roughly maybe a third have come back and why havent they why havent we seen more i think a lot of them i mean some of these are related to particular types of actions so ill give you an example settlement services you might have a settlement fund and then thats moved to another institution and what we get back is the promise that were not going to move that one back but future settlements will come to us i think thats part of it i think that there was some question about whats the new landscape going to look like i think its well publicized that svb had a policy you got to bank with us and you cant bank anywhere else that has proven to have been damaging and damaging to some of these franchises and so some of them were like okay we were banking with you as most of them were just single entity institutions and now theyre building relationships in two or three banks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah the other thing is back to we recaptured one large client that left us out of warehouse funding and in bringing that client back they had a lot of funds in what we call pi principal and interest accounts and those build up rather quickly come down pay build up come down every month and it just oscillates back and forth well we went back to them and reestablished the relationship we now took in pi accident insurance accounts which have a more steady stream to it so what weve also done here is trade it off volatility of volume for more consistency and weve done that too so as we bring clients back were trying to get better quality deposits longerterm and stickier and so this has allowed us to have a lot of great conversations with our client base but i can tell you i spend more time with the depositors in meetings that feel like an earnings report thats what we did coming out of q1 and in q2 now that has all changed and its about really the growth of the relationships the growth of the business and how we work together well thats some color there steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc well this quarter should help those conversations final question kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah were seeing the pipeline built steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah even with the increase of more expensive type funding if i just look at their sequential role in both interest bearing deposit costs and total funding these are decelerating pretty nicely over the past few quarters do you guys expect that trend to continue through the back half of this year thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so thats what gives us a little bit of comfort to provide the net interest margin guide going up and again as you saw june was and we think it rises from there and also gives us comfort to why we think net interest income is going to be higher in q3 than in q2 only a modest part of that net interest income rise is coming western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 actually from loan growth because were going to grow million to billion probably closer to million is a good number to use thats going to come in ratably across the quarter so you wont see that benefit until q4 so most of the growth in net interest income for q3 is really coming from minimizing the rising cost of funds which were very excited by steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks for taking my questions kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks steve operator thank you the next question will come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw your line is now open kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hello great thanks in terms of the ppnr guide you addressed the net interest income component i wonder if you could spend a minute on both the expenses and the amerihome aspect of just getting a full circle on ppnr i mean obviously the deposit and the insurance lines are indiscernible comment there and then also kind of comment on the gainonsale margins approaching normalizes indiscernible on amerihome thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay so amerihome generated about million of total banking revenue for us we modeled that out at about the same amount for q3 and q4 i will say it is early on its only or days into july but they are having a very very strong july and why is that well production margins have stabilized and actually returned to more historic levels so theyre running closer to bps and what we saw was the retreat of one very large money central bank from the correspondent lending market combined with the industry capacity rationalization has paved the path towards higher margins higher win rates and thats whats giving us a good deal of comfort with that were also building an msr which gives value and is producing doubledigit returns and so growing our capital allows us to bring in more servicing income so thats the amerihome story so for us its steady home and mortgage banking revenue going forward with potential upside given what were seeing in the current market thats how i would describe amerihome related to the expense efficiency or well call the adjusted expense efficiency we see that over time coming back into the high well i think whats very important here is that to remember that wal has always made investments with a viewpoint towards longer term returns for its business product service development and we focus on generating consistent earnings with the appropriate returns and so over the last several years what western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 were talking about today this is escrow services settlement services corporate trusts the online consumer platform and the growth the continued growth in hoa were all funded by consistent expense investments in our pl so we are going to balance the efficiency ratio for future growth as well as looking to get to our ppnr guide and our ppnr guide are at the high consider the adjusted efficiency ratio to remain at the high in the high to achieve the ppnr guide that weve given dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp essentially i mean i think weve had a reputation that were pretty efficient weve been in the low for a number of years and now we find ourselves elevated from that level but weve also grown very quickly during that period of time and its just natural as one thats in kind of a strong growth mode that some things are done that arent as efficient as they could have been structured or organized at that time were going through a process now to streamline that and look through some of these elements in terms of whether its vendors or consultants and things like this that we think also can push down some of these extra costs that weve had in our operating expense line christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great color if i could ask a followup you talked about net interest income growing exiting the year if i take a step back and think about ppnr the stable number for the back half of the year as the balance sheet normalizes and everything gets back to normal is the expectation that the ppnr dollar should grow off that low million as we enter kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so the way i would think about it its a little more stable in q3 as we look to pay down our borrowings and we maintain that q3 ppnr to q2 and then seeing that begin to rise in q4 as we ended the year into christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay but as you get into the fourth quarter and entering next year if everything else is considered with the balance sheet your ppnr should grow again in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yes christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right okay kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp ph im saying it should grow in q4 and then itll continue on from there western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thanks ken kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay thank you operator thank you the next question will be from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush your line is now open kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hello david david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks i wanted hi so i wanted follow up on the expense question so you mentioned about optimizing work streams through the bank could you elaborate on that are we talking kind of trimming on the edges or are you contemplating exiting any businesses kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so were talking about trimming on the edges here predominantly and some of the expense savings that we are going to find throughout the company will be repositioned into risk control risk management infrastructure i think you have to keep in mind and the regulators had clearly signaled this that theyre going to have a higher standard of supervisory review for banks under billion but above billion but i think theyre going to drop that below billion and as we continue to grow we need to be prepared for that and weve been preparing all along but some of that expense savings were going to take and were going to reinvest in the risk control infrastructure that were going to need to cross billion wed rather do it early on and have a steady growth of expenses related to that rather than to wait and try to put it in just before you get to billion so david so were going to see some of the work stream repositioning in terms of lower cost as dale said vendor management eliminating growth in fte we dont need thats like cutting air that will help us a little bit and then looking at vendor management using technology a lot of those cost savings will be repositioned into the tech into the risk management side so we can continue to grow unabated as the rules change for the billion and above and the billion and below banks david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks for that and then a followup on credit quality related to the increase in special mention loans what does it take or what do you have to see for you to designate a loan as special mention does the borrower have to trip a covenant for that to happen and what actions do you take with a borrower after it goes on special mention western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp let me take this one thank you tim bruckner this is something that were i think pretty proud of dale mentioned throughout the initial discussion comments theres a few things that are just foundational to our credit process first in all areas we assess risk as covered and uncovered okay so we really minimized tail risk by that covered means youve gotten out always by collateral early identification and elevation are key and then time is of the essence in solving problems we manage tail risk by managing our uncovered exposure by getting to that early to do that we have to be pretty mechanical in our process so to answer your question directly in all cases special mention loans are current and paying as agreed okay so special mention and a regulatory definition means potential weakness not default or late payment so were not looking for a monetary default were looking for situations where there might be potential weakness so that we can elevate those within our credit architecture and make the appropriate changes before those become problems so we use special mention to elevate the situation and ph driving to a satisfactory resolution before were dealing with a default or a late payment another thing that you can say here is everything thats in special mention we believe that were going to reach that resolution which would be a satisfactory remargining or additional support from sponsorship that would return that ph to pass or we have that credit substandard so thats how we use the categorys mechanical ph arm process thank you david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thanks very much operator thank you the next question will be from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo your line is now open timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning thanks for the question most have been asked and answered but just looking at the loan growth this quarter i guess surprised to the upside just curious as to what drove that how much of that was kind of contractual fundings and as you look forward what gives you confidence in getting to that million number versus the growth that we saw in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay great well the billion of loan growth you can break it in half million was really a reclass from heldforsale going back into heldforinvestment which means that our deposit drive our increase in liquidity do not necessitate having to sell those loans and so we were pleased with that then we had million of organic growth this quarter and then most of that came from the warehouse lending but those financing msr lines of business and why thats important is those businesses carry when we make credit decisions there we usually get a fair amount of deposits that come along with this so they almost selffund themselves so that was the beauty of having that loan growth that it also drove our deposit growth and as part of what weve been saying even from the last couple of calls that were looking at full client relationships and were no longer western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 just giving credit and then worrying about how we fund it away from the client the client needs to have a full relationship with us as we go forward and what we may have what gives us some credit or our confidence i guess on the million guide we see a few areas that were going to focus on a little bit more in ci at this point but we see msr lending providing opportunity ph loan financing providing opportunity we do ph resort lending which we think will provide opportunity and were doing tech and innovation loans and these are smallsized loans or loan commitments under million and we see theres great opportunity to bring with it a great deal of deposits so those are some of the areas that we are focusing on that gives us some comfort level to the million guide timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then now i asked this question last quarter and i think it may be a little bit early but with some of the return of technologyrelated customers i guess where do you see western alliance fitting in to the tech ecosystem going forward are you going to be playing a larger role in taking up some of the market share abandoned by silicon valley or should we think about the technology offering of western alliance similar to what had happened prior kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so thats an interesting question a good strategic question i think were going to continue to play in the space that weve been playing in which is usually stage two were not going to be playing or taking up the role of svb in early stage lending thats not what we do we prefer to be in the middle stage and a little bit in the late stage so thats where were going to continue to keep our focus i will say that what were seeing is that current and prior svb customers and bankers as i said earlier before continue to evaluate the changing landscape as both constituencies are making judgements regarding longterm commitments to the industry by new players and theyre waiting to see how those new players credit policies operating practices will be administered for us bridge bank as i keep saying is uniquely positioned as a known brand and a consistent player in the market and i think that approach is continuing to get traction so i have some great expectations from our tech and innovation group bridge bank in terms of deposit growth in q3 and going into q4 as we continue to be the steady player and the steady hand in that market that people can go to when they come to us they know what our policies are they know who theyre talking to they know what our credit decisionmaking process is they know how to reach senior management and we have a track record with these folks so we think its an opportunity for us and were excited by it timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great and then just lastly for me maybe following up on bernards question for some of the promotional products just given how strong the deposit growth has been and the momentum youre gaining in bringing back some prior customers i guess why not pull back from some of the promotional rates is this nearly kind of a near term dynamic as youre continuing to build the liquidity or are we still in an environment where the more the better regardless of the cost dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 theres a little bit of the more the better but maybe more significantly is those rates which seem to be i guess their market rate pricing but theyre still less than what were paying for other sources so here we have a more stable source and its a lower cost and were going to keep doing that now over time i think we are going to be able to ph pay that but so where were headed is more liquidity is a good thing and indiscernible less expensively were going to do that indiscernible the timing on your note that was indiscernible timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks guys appreciate it operator thank you the next question will be from the line of gary tenner with da davidson your line is now open gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co thanks good morning a couple of questions first on the as it relates to keeping our guide you talked about fees in terms of how youre thinking about mortgage but the service charge line this quarter increased from million to almost million i dont recall you kind of mentioning that at all just curious what the driver was there i guess ultimately how is that level baked into the ppnr guide for the back half of the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp let me say it differently our total fee income we are looking at which is primarily driven by amerihome is going to stay consistent for the next couple of quarters so when you think about the ppnr guide i would say fee income consistent with q2 possibly with an arrow upward if some of the early signs of mortgage income success in july continues throughout the quarter and thats whats driving the ppnr guide that we gave earlier gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay and then on the aoci dale i think you mentioned about billion of securities to mature back half of this year and through what amount of the kind of afsrelated aoci just based on maturities would you expect to recover over that 18month period dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i mean obviously those costs are related to kind of what the discount rate is so if its that close to maturity and we have a yield that is less than what that looks like then its going to be fairly short i mean i think you really get dollar improvement on the aoci piece what we really need is we really need lower rates so it will roll forward if you take months we have a duration of four years on that so youre taking onethird of that back so maybe a couple of hundred billion comes back but not from maturity its just from a slower or a shorter duration remaining on those securities the fouryear coming down by about a third regarding the service charge income so that yeah it is elevated from where we were and its going to continue gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 okay and last question if i could in terms of the office or the investor office portfolio could you tell us kind of what your allowance is specific to that portfolio kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i can take that not counting well counting earnings by about million gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co sorry kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp oh im sorry million gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co oh so million kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah im sorry i misquoted that gary peter tenner q analyst d a davidson co okay thank you operator thank you the next question will be from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america your line is now open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning just as a quick followup one in terms of the margin outlook as you talked about the third quarter nim higher versus does that trend continue into fourth quarter as we think about on a goforward basis or could we see some volatility in the margin where could be lower and indiscernible dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well what were seeing is i think its almost certain that theyre going to raise next week we have a modest kind of assetsensitive profile so that should augment the nim in that regard more significantly kind of what we talked about a couple of times the paydown in some of these more expensive funding sources so ive talked about these lines that we have that are sofr plus we havent paid those down yet i expect that we will be doing that significantly this quarter i cant tell you exactly when but lets say we did it in august or september were going to see a followthrough effect on that into so yes i would expect that we should be looking for western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 kind of continued improvement and ken kind of alluded to this what he said that our ppnr number kind of flat for q3 versus q2 but then on a more positive trajectory as we go into q4 and exit ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got that and dale in terms of the actual loan book how much of the loan book is yet to reprice in terms of just reflecting the current indiscernible like how should we think about loan betas going forward and repricing of the fixed rate book maybe dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean the fixed rate book is predominantly residential real estate and prepayment rates on those loans are quite low so at some point in time i mean i think probably rates have to come down a little bit before those are really going to start to accelerate so aside from that i dont know that theres a whole lot of repricing opportunity in the loan book i think the securities book probably has more where weve got as i mentioned billion in the back half of this year and another billion next year within the loan book weve got another billion that is going to kind of roll in so i really think that the margin improvement and a big driver of the ppnr improvement is really coming from swapping lowercost funding sources compared to some of the elements that we have supporting us today ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you operator thank you the next question will be from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks few questions for you tim that slide the asset quality slide you guys talked about being proactive what do you think those lines look like in q3 and q4 should we be prepared for those to go higher or do you think that this proactiveness is going to keep those relatively flat timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp yeah thanks thats a good and very understandable question i think relatively flat and i think that because thats been our experience with this approach and other cycles barring severe changes and were already contemplating a tougher economy going forward we elevated the situations we know them by name were not dealing with a large portfolio here in the absolute we call those out discuss them monthly we dont wait till a quarter to see the changes so i feel comfortable saying relatively flat kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and jon this is ken we also completed our q2 very exhaustive and comprehensive review of cre office so we did a very very deep dive into that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp as we mentioned i mean were looking at this jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp with a view toward a recession which may or may not take place but thats the outlook we have jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay yeah that ties into my next question and i guess instead of poking and prodding ill just ask it you guys are saying stable ppnr and then relatively stable provision based on moodys and then s4 weighting that you referred to you guys usually give eps guidance is this the trough on eps im looking at the consensus for it feels like a layup given what you just put up but am i missing something on that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well were not ready to project on but i mean i think the direction of what weve laid out for the third and fourth quarter i think we have good confidence in we obviously hope that we can continue to execute in terms of bringing back lowercost funding and expanding our underwriting prospectively i mean im not sure a recession is in the offing i think our expenses dont have a lot of elevation coming in them either so im optimistic to what the future holds here jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay so said another way dale it feels like theres at least stability going into q3 assuming nothing changes materially from a credit point of view dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp right kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yes thats a good assumption jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then one more for you ken kind of a fun question but its been a hell of a four months and you guys have managed through it well given that the hand you had but do you feel like theres been any permanent damage done to your franchise i know you mentioned bridge and i think the different brands help but do you western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 think has the pressure faded and its going to be a distant memory and youre back to normal or you think theres been some damage done kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so i dont think theres any permanent damage done but i think there was disruption is the word i would continue to use it took us off of our trajectory of growth we had to rely on wholesale funding for a shorter period of time thats why youre hearing all the answers about the rise in nim because were going to swap out these borrowings and bring in more deposits this was all something that believe it or not in q3 or the q3 earnings call of we had i want to say anticipated that the world was going to change a little bit we didnt anticipate what was going to happen on march nine but we started to move into a slower loan growth higher liquid world with greater capital and thats sort of the model that we are using and were moving forward i think if there was any damage done it was done a little bit as i said in the deposit pipeline in some of our businesses that are still relatively new relative to the other businesses in the company and that gave people pause because they werent with us for a long period of time but we are rebuilding those deposit pipelines and thats giving me some optimism to the billion guide for q3 and the deposit guide going forward dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp and jon its actually been a little bit of a silver lining on some of this and that is it has really got our attention and made us focus on our business model and weve honed it so to the degree that we were doing some syndicated deals we were doing some writing credit where we didnt have a deposit relationship its much more reciprocal today on our efr case for example we started by making million commitments in a billion syndication line but were not doing that we never got the liquidity from the clients in that situation but instead what we do is we do bilateral transactions that are better priced and its a closer relationship that we have with them and of course we get their funding as well weve also taken a little bit of a different tack we dont want to do this again and so what weve done is we have taken our insured deposit levels to about the highest in the nation were moving our capital i want to spin it around so that when somebody is looking at who can we attack when the next situation might arise western alliance isnt anywhere near on that list because were a stalwart for capital strength liquidity and performance jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay very helpful thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks jon operator thank you the next question will be from the line of brody preston with ubs your line is now open western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey everyone thanks for taking my questions dale i was just hoping to dig a little deeper on the moving parts on the margin but i wanted to follow up on steves question and im sorry if you guys said it and i missed it but on the billion of new deposits i know its weighted towards mortgage warehouse but i was interested and if you have an idea as to what the cost is just because when i look at the new and returned deposit growth and the existing client growth it looks like it had about a cost on it for this quarter is that billion close to that cost kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so again a lot of that this is ken brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc yeah kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp a lot of the deposit growth is coming from our warehouse lending book which means its growing in our non interestbearing deposits and from an interest expense point of view that comes with a zero cost although the ecr credits are in the operating expense line so thats going to skew more towards having a lower interest expense for both the warehouse lending business as well as some growth thats coming early on from hoa which is a lowercost channel as well brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it so if youre getting a lot of growth in the i know its got an ecr but its noninterestbearing im looking at that interestbearing deposit cost and the spot rate at is lower than the you did on average for the quarter i guess if youre growing the interestbearing deposit cost at a blended rate with those new clients or the total deposit costs i guess at why wouldnt that interestbearing deposit cost continue to move lower from here in the third quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well so i mean warehouse deposits they have an earnings credit rate which is much higher than its close to kind of effective fed funds generally so its going to be higher than that but youre correct brody in that yeah these funds theyre not wholesale theyre not brokered so theres a lower charge associated with them in terms of what that is in their client relationships and so were trading down in terms of what its costing us from there i mean hoa was a significant contributor some of those have ecrs as well but those dollars those are going to be in the range as opposed to kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well your premise about a cost of funds equal to q2 or q3 going forward thats not a bad premise western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and then just on the loan yield the average loan yield for the quarter the difference between the spot and the average for the quarter is relatively large so the spot rate is if we think about the third quarter and we think about a potential for another rate hike here i guess how does the loan yield move off of that for the third quarter assuming that that happens dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean i think were going to see something like of that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it so i guess if i take those two pieces combined then dale just with like the deposit costs kind of stalling out at this level and loan yields continuing to move higher i just look at that to nim guide the implied nii guide and the ppnr guide that you have for the back half of the year and it just feels exceptionally conservative and so i guess why shouldnt we be thinking about something well north of by the time we hit the fourth quarter of the year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well i would argue with exceptionally i think it is i think i mean we want to lean conservative obviously a little bit the other thing i would say that i think you need maybe to consider or recognize is that a lot of these deposit costs we have are going to be moving up when the fomc moves next week as well so to the degree that weve got kind of appropriate funding and some of these other sources relatively shortterm earnings credit rates for some of these large balances related to mortgage warehouse clients those are going to move almost at lockstep meaning that it doesnt show up necessarily in interest expense but it shows up in terms of the cost of our ppnr number so there is going to be a push up in terms of funding charges related to that as well but as i mentioned we are assetsensitive and so the net effect of what happens next week should be a plus brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then just last couple on credit for me i just wanted to ask was there you mentioned you did the office cre deepdive was that what kind of drove the reappraisals on those office those cbd office loans ken or was there something else specifically that drove that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp oh that was it that was it brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then i know that when youre working through the special mention yeah western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp im sorry i was answering the other question which was indiscernible we basically only have one credit in cbd and that we moved to substandard and then we reappraised it and it reappraised higher than the loan amount so thats the answer to that im sorry i cut you off on the other question brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc no thats okay i was just going to say i know that when youre working through the special mention loans at least this is what you did with the hotels during covid you kind of as you mentioned you asked them to re margin the loan i guess its early days but with any of those conversations with your sponsors has anybody balked at the idea of bringing more equity to the table to help remargin these loans kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp no so the reason why theyre in special mention there is some weaknesses as tim bruckner said but also theres a spirit of cooperation that they want to get to a positive outcome that will either require remargining or restructuring in some way shape or form whats interesting maybe well leave you with this fun fact brody our average ltv is about were a low advanced rate lender so on our billion of cre allin for the company theres about billion of equity in front of us and so im talking about the whole book and that gives a lot of motivation for sponsors to sit and work with us in the assets that have been moved into special mention brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay yeah just given how proactive it is and it sounds like the borrowers are willing to kind of meet you there to me again it sounds like maybe special mention loans will be heading lower and classified loans heading lower into the year end but i guess well watch that going forward thanks for taking the questions guys kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator thank you the next question will be from the line of david smith with autonomous research your line is now open david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous good morning so the strong liquidity growth this quarter led you to bring back on about million from held forsale back to heldforinvestments of the remaining billion in heldforsale are you viewing any of that as potentially coming back as well if you have another strong quarter of deposit growth kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp a good portion of that in the heldforsale relates to our western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean this is something were just going to always evaluate so based upon kind of where we are but with the billion its queued up its marked and well see how it goes but most of that we expect to exit david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous and would you expect the cet1 benefit from that to be proportional to the benefit you saw from the billion of sales that youve already executed dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp so i mean the cet1 elements are i mean most of the assets were talking about are all riskweighted that goes for whats already been done but not all as well as whats in there presently so i mean but at the same time i mean as those loans come off the books that is beneficial to cet1 conversely i mean i think the industry is looking at a special charge probably this quarter to recapitalize the insurance fund related to the demise of those three institutions so thatll be a thatll be some charge thatll be maybe basis points against our capital growth in q3 as presently proposed david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous sure and lastly you talked about laying the groundwork for eventually crossing the billion asset mark i guess youre just continuing to build billion of deposits a quarter thats a billion a year from billion to billion would take you about four years from now that seems very proactive what do we need to see to take up your the growth targets and growth goals before that if you were going to hit that mark any sooner what would give you comfort to open the growth back up kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so let me just give some color commentary about being very early i think what youre going to see is supervisory review from the regulators starting much earlier and holding you to a higher standard well before billion so the process isnt a you hit billion youre going to be reviewed differently the process starts well before that that are you ready to cross over billion and that starts before that that would be my just color commentary on how that review process works and why were building it in terms of opening the gates i think our growth is going to be determined by our deposits and our growth in deposits and we have traditionally been a little bit more heavierweighted to the left side of the balance sheet which we can turn that machine on and were really good at growing loans well weve turned around and said wait a minute we need to have a more holistic relationship with our client base and growing the deposits are critical obviously to our future growth and investing in future deposit channels and the deposit channels that weve talked about here today that will drive the deposit growth in the future so we said billion last quarter that we thought wed grow deposits we came in at billion yes there was a lot of brokered in there this quarter we say billion without brokered and were going to try to exceed and do better than that and then well kind of grow our way into david smith q analyst bernsteinautonomous western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2023 all right thats helpful thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thank you operator thank you at this time there are no additional questions registered in the queue so i would like to pass the call back over to our host ken
