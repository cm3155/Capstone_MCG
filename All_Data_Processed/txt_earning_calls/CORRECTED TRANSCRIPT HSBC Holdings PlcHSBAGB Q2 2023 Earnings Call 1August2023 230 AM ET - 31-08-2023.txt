management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investor and analysts conference calls for hsbc holdings plcs interim results for for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to your host mr noel quinn group chief executive richard oconnor global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc good afternoon to those joining us here in hong kong and good morning for those in london and elsewhere noel and george will present strategy and the results and we will allow plenty of time for questions from the telephone lines and the live audience here in hong kong with that over to noel wholl host the conference noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you richard and good afternoon to everyone in the room here in hong kong thank you for joining us and great to see you again and good morning to everyone watching from london and elsewhere before george takes you through the second quarter numbers ill start with a summary of the first half performance and progress first i show this slide every quarter its critical in that it summarizes our strategy and our strategy remains unchanged it is summarized by the four pillars at the bottom of the slide let me take you through the latest outcomes of that strategy we had a good first six months im pleased with the broadbased profit and revenue generated by our global businesses and geographies im also pleased with our strong capital generation and returns we delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of including the two material notable items reported in the first quarter or if you exclude those notable items and weve announced a second interim dividend of per share and a second share buyback of up to billion today were also upgrading our guidance now we expect to achieve a return on tangible equity in the midteens for and prior to we were very focused on transforming the business now while still continuing to improve operational efficiency we are very focused on driving growth diversifying revenue and creating incremental value we have a plan built around six areas i will take you through some of these over the next few slides starting with our international connectivity we grew wholesale crossborder client business in the first half by around with growth across all regions driven by higher rates our international proposition in wealth and personal banking continues to gain traction we now have million international wpb customers and that is up or over the last months thats significant because these international customers generate around times the average customer revenue finally we drove strong revenue growth in transaction banking which was up there were good performances in foreign exchange and in global payments solutions trade was slightly down yearonyear in line with global trade volumes but trade balances stabilized in the second quarter particularly in asia and hsbc was named best bank for trade finance by euromoney for the second year in a row as well as best bank in asia the next slide sets out our latest progress on another area of focus the redeployment of capital from less strategic or lowconnectivity businesses into highergrowth international opportunities im pleased that we agreed new terms for the sale of our french retail banking operations in the quarter the deal is subject to regulatory hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 approval and we now have a lot of work to do to complete migration in early the sale of our banking operations in canada remains on track to complete in early with a special dividend of per share planned thereafter we completed the disposal of our greek business last weekend and weve announced the disposal of our russian operations we are changing the nature of our business in oman and we will wind down our wpb operations in new zealand crucially this is allowing us to target growth opportunities some of which are set out on the righthand side the first is the continued development of our wealth business across the whole of asia our digitallyenabled wealth and insurance business in mainland china now has wealth planners and is driving good new business growth we launched global private banking in india last month in june we launched hsbc innovation banking a strengthened globallyconnected proposition on the back of our purchase of svb uk we will nurture the specialism that we acquired back it with hsbcs balance sheet strength and global network and build further innovation banking businesses in the us here in hong kong and israel the process is already well underway and will enable us to support our clients in the technology and life sciences sectors to achieve their global ambitions finally weve announced today that we are also increasing our shareholding in tradeshift and have agreed to launch a jointlyowned business in early to provide embedded financing solutions within their trade ecosystem we believe this will help us to grow our client base in commercial banking giving us a new avenue for growth outside of traditional relationship banking the next slide looks at how we are diversifying revenue by growing fee income and collaboration as ive said our wealth strategy continues to gather momentum especially in asia netnew invested assets were down in the rest of the world due to lower thirdparty asset management liquidity products mainly in the us but they were up in asia by to billion over the last months we took in a total of billion of netnew invested assets and grew our invested assets by globally this all underlines the growth potential of our wealth business fee income in commercial banking was up in the first half and collaboration revenues between our global businesses were up collaboration revenue is particularly important in a relatively lowgrowth economic environment because we can drive growth from within the organization the next slide focuses on the tight cost discipline weve maintained and how it enables us to invest in the bank of the future we remain committed to disciplined cost management and have continued to use cost savings to increase investment in digitization we increased spending on technology by in the first half and this spending now accounts for of our target base operating expenses this investment has translated into faster services reduced friction and more competitive products all of which will improve the customer experience and our operational efficiency weve made good progress increasing digital penetration amongst personal and business customers while increasing our product release frequency investing in technology is also enhancing our capabilities we now have a range of testandlearn use cases for generative ai across hsbc and are in the process of scaling up a small number of those last month we became the first bank to join bt and toshibas quantumsecured metro network this uses quantum technology for secure transmission of data which should mitigate the risk of future cyber threats and we are pleased to be working with the hong kong monetary authority on two pilots to test the ehkd in a new payments ecosystem and to trial tokenized deposits my last slide shows how weve continued to build on our position as an enabler of the net zero transition in the first half we provided and facilitated billion of sustainable finance and investments as we continue to work closely with our clients on their transition plans this consisted of capital markets financing and onbalance sheet lending to clients and included a number of key deals in asia and the middle east we were recently named best bank for sustainable finance in asia by euromoney for the sixth consecutive year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 ill now hand over to george to take you through the q2 numbers georges elhedery group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you noel and a warm welcome to everyone in the room with us today it is great to be back here in hong kong to deliver our interim results and for those of you watching today from london and across the globe a very good morning and thank you for joining us weve announced a good set of second quarter results reported profits before tax were at billion up on last years second quarter revenue was up at billion this was driven by first nii of billion which was up billion or yearonyear and second nonnii of billion which was up billion or yearonyear we booked expected credit losses of billion in the quarter despite the inflationary environment cost growth in the quarter was restricted to compared to last years second quarter including billion of severance costs these severance costs were expected and we are on track to meet our cost target to limit cost growth to around on our target cost basis compared to the first quarter lending and deposits were both down due to subdued loan demand deposit outflows in global banking and markets in europe and the reclassification of our portfolio in oman to heldforsale our cet1 ratio remained strong at as noel said we announced a second interim dividend of per share and a second share buyback of up to billion which we intend to complete in around three months tnav per share was down due primarily to the final interim dividend for and the first interim dividend for the next slide shows another strong quarterly revenue performance with overall growth of compared to the second quarter of three further points on this as noel mentioned revenue was up in all three global businesses wealth was up due to higher rates and the strong insurance performing performance mainly here in hong kong and three across commercial banking and global banking and markets global payment services sic global payments solutions reported revenues of around billion an increase of on the second quarter of on the next slide reported net interest income was billion up billion or on the first quarter we have introduced banking nii as a new disclosure this quarter it is derived by adjusting reported nii for the centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities and the nii generated by the insurance business at billion banking nii was up billion on the first quarter and up billion on last years second quarter the billion centrally allocated cost of funding trading activities within global banking and markets in the second quarter included a 04billion yeartodate impact of methodology changes as a reminder the related income associated with these funding costs is reported with nonnii the net interest margin was basis points up basis points from the first quarter of and up basis points on the second quarter of we continue our structural hedging activity our nii sensitivity is billion for a 100basis point drop in rate against a previous yearend sensitivity of billion at this point we are adjusting our nii guidance we now expect nii of at least billion in within this we expect the centrally allocated cost to funding trading activities within global banking and markets to be in excess of billion with associated income reported in nonnii we continue to reiterate that we expect to see higher passthrough rates and continued migration to turn to time deposits and we remain cautious on loan growth over the next to months but we do expect it to start picking up sometime in i know that many of you will have questions about banking nii in particular which ill be very happy to address as we move into qa later on moving on nonnii of billion was down on the first quarter which benefited from billion of notable items and fx translation however it was up billion or on the second quarter of a couple of things to mention here one there was a strong wealth performance up billion or on the second quarter of last year billion of which came from increased life insurance income primarily in hong hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 kong and two markets and securities services was down due to lower client activity and the methodology change that i just mentioned earlier fees were up billion on the second quarter of due to higher personal banking and commercial banking fees turning now to credit our second quarter ecl charge was billion which was billion up on the second quarter last year it includes billion for our mainland china commercial real estate exposure booked in hong kong and the 03billion charge for the uk to remind you this is a more normalized level of charge that we expect for this year and is a sign that our main credit indicators are holding up on the basis of what we have seen so far in and ongoing macroeconomic headwinds we continue to expect a ecl charge of around basis points of average gross customer lending including held for sale balances the next slide is our sixmonthly update on our mainland china commercial real estate portfolio as before our principal area of focus remains the portfolio booked in hong kong at the full year our exposure was billion it now stands at billion due primarily to repayments the proportion of substandard and credit impaired exposures is around of the portfolio marginally up from the full year of these billion of exposures that we rate as substandard or credit impaired billion is secured with minimal ecl due to the ph securities head against the remaining billion we have increased our provisions from billion at the full year to billion today within this our coverage ratio against the unsecured credit impaired exposures has increased from around to nearly at the end of we calculated a plausible downside scenario of billion on this portfolio as you can see we have now crystalized some of that downside into the pl we remain comfortable with our coverage level on slide despite the inflationary environment cost growth was restricted to on a constant currency basis versus the second quarter last year as you can see a large share of this growth was technology related there was also a higher performancerelated pay accrual and the expected severance costs which were part offset by a writeback of software and lease impairments we remain committed to limiting cost growth to around in on our cost target basis on this target basis second quarter costs were up yearonyear of which around half was the billion of expected severance costs as a reminder our cost target basis exclude notable items from constant currency operating expenses it also excludes the impact of retranslating hyperinflationary economies at constant currency and finally it excludes the acquired cost base and additional investments in hsbc innovation banking which are expected to result in incremental growth of around above our targeted basis the full cost target basis reconciliation will be on slide of this deck our cet1 ratio was which was stable on the previous quarter profit generation was offset by the dividend accrual of billion during the first half and the share buyback of billion that is now completed so in summary this was another good quarter there were good profit and net interest income performances credit remains resilient we are on track to limit cost growth in to on our cost target basis we now expect nii of at least billion in and as noel said we now expect a midteens return on tangible equity in and in excluding the sale the upcoming sale of canada finally we are returning capital to shareholders by way of increased dividends and share buybacks and with that ill ask richard if he can open it up for questions richard please thank you richard oconnor global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc operator can you open up for questions please can i remind questioners to stick to one or two questions only please well take four or five from the lines and then well take live questions here from hong kong just remind the analysts in hong kong to give your name and institution and therell be mic around to enable you to be heard hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 with that operator can we take our first question from manus costello please question and answer section operator thank you mr oconnor operator instructions our first question from today is from manus costello from autonomous your line is open manus costello q analyst autonomous hi thanks very much for taking the question i needed to ask about nii please a couple of questions firstly i noted that when nim was flat in asia in h1 quarteronquarter could you give us a bit more color around indiscernible what you would expect into q3 i appreciate the change in the cost indiscernible were allocated there but i would still indiscernible were actually some benefits from prior indiscernible a little bit more and then secondly youve also talked about increasing hedging and the structural hedge in order to reduce your downside risk on nii can you give us a bit more detail on what youve done and how to think about that in terms of potential benefits going forward into and beyond thank you very much noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks manus george do you want to pick up both of those points please georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure thanks noel thank you manus so on nimnii nim in asia was flat because most of the uplift from rates has translated into an uplift in the nonnii component of the trading book funding about billion uplift in in that space weve introduced banking nii in due course we will enhance our disclosure in the space to introduce banking nii sensitivity and banking nim which would be reflecting such an such an uplift the with regards to your second question manus the hedging activity so if you look at our nii sensitivity downwards basis point have reduced from billion to billion about onethird of that reduction is due to our hedging structure and hedging activity and another onethird of that reduction would be the effect of the change of the composition of our balance sheet and then the last onethird is numerous other factors including modelling enhancements if you now look at our structural hedging activity which weve conducted over the last months the overall impact on the reduction of banking nii sensitivity is to the tune of billion richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you georges georges you just want to explain why theres been more of a move into the sort of the non nii trading book georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc what the route the underlying cause of that is georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure so what due to the somewhat subdued loan growth in asia we have the management of asia has taken the decision to allocate more funding towards supporting some of the trading activities so the overall funding of our trading books globally which heavily used also in asia moved from about billion or circa of our deposit base to around billion or about of our deposit base that additional lending or that additional transition from funds have moved nii into nonnii income it is still ratesensitive and it does benefit from improved level of rates you know particularly in dollars where its coming from richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please operator thank you our next question is from aman rakkar from barclays your line is open aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning noel noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning george good morning richard i morning i have two questions please so again on net interest income at face value your greater than billion nii guide does imply stepups in the run rate with net interest income in q3 and q4 i suspect youd point us to the greater than billion suggesting that theres some conservatism baked in there but can you talk to what the pressures are or indiscernible actually even the sources of support on the net interest income run rate from here through to yearend will i think one thing the market would love is some sense of whether this level of net interest income is sustainable beyond this year so anything you can give us there i guess relatedly i note that the uk has been very strong as well so any kind of color you can give us on the moving parts there and the sustainability of net interest income in the uk would be great second question was around distributions specifically around your dividend youre reiterating your payout ratio guidance this year and potentially next year it does look like its going to be quite strong earnings i guess if i take consensus looking for an underlying eps of around which implies an ordinary dividend of i mean that number feels big big versus you used to speak versus what you did last year and i guess the question is how comfortable are you with paying a big ordinary dividend now which might then become quite difficult to sustain in the future if rates come off and earnings kind of taper are you bothered that you do this year and you do some number thats lower than that next year or thereafter thank you very much hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george you want to certainly take the nii one first and just clarification on that and then well come to distributions georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure thank you armando sic aman so kind of in turn addressing your points first as you did say were emphasizing that this is a floor were emphasizing this is a guidance of greater than billion were revising this floor because we gained more comfort halfway into the year and with the outcomes of h1 we want to remain cautious and you may find our guidance to be cautious given the difficulty to forecast some of the challenges ill talk about in a second and then in terms of outlook for the rest of the year look we are not looking to change the consensus for h2 nii were comfortable where h2 nii consensus stands at this stage now in terms of the pressure and the support were seeing well were seeing certainly tailwinds that weve seen already in q2 one in terms of additional rate hikes to be expected very much in the major currencies such as dollar pounds and euro weve seen also tailwinds in the hibor normalization weve seen about quarteronquarter normalization of hibor and if you look at july we continue seeing further normalization hibor is now around so probably at the end of july will have fully normalized and those will provide us certainly some tailwinds as we look into h2 this being said we continue to see the same headwinds weve been calling out from the yearend and they will continue manifesting in h2 the first headwind which we forecast to remain is the subdued balance sheet growth certainly subdued loan growth due to the activity we have indicated we may see some resumption in but for this half for the next half year would probably remain as a headwind and naturally the other headwind that is very difficult to forecast is the deposit costs behavior what passthrough rates we will be feeding in what is the impact of lagged migration to time deposits in hong kong were still assuming a migration per month and whether this manifests as it is it is very difficult to forecast hence our cautiousness now if i look forward look were not guiding for nii in but there are a few things i can just give you to kind of bake in your analysis the first one is you have to exclude canada and france upon completion of these france retail upon completion of these transactions which now we expect for canada in q1 and then france as we initially ambitioned were aiming 1st of january the second one you have to expect that balance sheet growth will resume at some stage in and that will give us support for nii the third one is obviously the structural hedging which i mentioned a bit earlier and the impact they will have on more stabilization of outlook for nii and obviously the fourth one is what interest rate assumptions youre going to use and what passthrough rates youre going to use and then last but not the least we are investing a lot in our nonnii or fee incomeearning businesses and do expect fee incomeearning businesses to continue driving some of that growth thats it for the nii component noel i can talk to distribution noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc please carry on with dividends as well please georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 so dividend so what we shared is that were going to pay a dividend payout ratio excluding notable items i think in your math based on consensus you have taken out notable items im not going to comment on the size of the dividend but what im going to say is in order for us to sustain dividend there are a few things were working on and you can as well do the math armando sic aman the first one is share buybacks as you know share buybacks is reducing our share count and to the extent we ambition to continue on the journey of share buybacks as long as we remain capitalgenerative which is what we forecast you have to adjust your denominator by the share count the second thing is the nii stabilization actions were taking which should give us some protection from a reversal of the rate cycle and the third and fourth third one is obviously our cost discipline will be maintained even though we havent yet or were not ready to share numbers we will maintain the discipline and lastly as i again indicated fee income growth and the investments were putting in feegenerating areas such as investment in wealth are also initiatives to supportmitigate turn in our earnings and therefore return and possible dividends beyond noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george excellent a very comprehensive answer to both questions so thank you thanks aman next question please operator thank you our next question is from raul sinha from jpmorgan your line is open raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc good morning noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc good morning raul sinha q analyst jpmorgan securities plc hi everyone thank you very much for taking my questions maybe can i have two please the first one just on distribution perhaps ph going by georges thoughts on potential for buybacks in the second half of the year looking at your capital ratio obviously you probably have to make a couple of adjustments indiscernible that basis points and then weve got the buyback that youve announced today thats basis points off the headline level just thinking about your rote guidance does imply indiscernible second half so just wondering if you can scope for us georges what the buyback might be from here and then the second one just the lull on wealth management revenue growth if i look at the wealth management revenue this quarter roughly billion just sort of stable from q1 im wondering if that understates some of the momentum that you are building within the business so if you could just help us understand how you expect the wealth management revenues to go from there that would be helpful thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah happy to do that ill let george take the buyback question first hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so in terms of the buyback obviously the fact that today we announced a billion buyback will today have an impact on our q3 cet1 ratio of basis points but you do expect us to continue generating profitability which will build capital of which will be provisioned for dividend as in dividend based on the dividend payout ratio anticipation and therefore that buyback will take into the additional capital generation so i wouldnt look at q3 basis points due to the buyback we just announced as a challenge this is obviously this is just upfronting if you want the profit generation that we will be doing in the quarter beyond that again at this stage what i can say is we believe we remain capitalgenerative for the foreseeable future and as long as we are capitalgenerative we remain we continue to ambition a rolling series of share buybacks but obviously we will review this on a quarterbyquarter basis based on a number of factors including our capital adequacy ratio and just want to also highlight and probably answering your question rauf sic raul and complementing the question of armando sic aman earlier that the canada sale expected in q1 will provide us additional capital the priority use of the first part of it is for a dividend which will you know we will be in a position to distribute expected in h1 and then the residual part of it we will utilize to supplement or complement or topup any capital buyback we are planning to do noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you i think its a fair comment on your second question what were talking about here is very much growth in lead indicators you know the billion of net new invested assets here in asia in the first half up globally net new invested assets growth of billion over the past months a growth in our aggregate invested assets of globally you know theyre strong lead indicators an additional million international customers in the past months for me theyre the lead indicators i think youre absolutely right therell be a lag effect as you turn that customer acquisition and asset acquisition into revenue but thats why were talking about building businesses and new growth opportunities that can supplement our revenue going forward and give us some cushion an offset to any downside rate effect that may emerge post and post so we think its the right thing to do and youre right the revenue will be a lag indicator on those early success criteria that were sharing with you if you remember growth in our wealth business in mainland china you know we started with zero wealth managers just over two years ago weve now got our ambition is to get to over the the relatively near term over the next couple of couple of years or so again that will be revenue generative as an offset because most of that is fee based as an offset to any downside pressure that may be on interest rates so i think your second comment is a fair comment but id turn that into the positive rather than the negative richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc and raul just to add as youre aware q2 q1 was going to be seasonally a bit stronger and ifrs means you build revenue from a pretty low base up rapidly noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc well take one more from the lines of andrew coombs and then well turn to the live audience in hong kong please operator thank you our next question is from andrew coombs from citi your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc hi andrew andrew coombs q analyst citigroup global markets ltd hey guys good afternoon two questions please just firstly on chinese commercial real estate indiscernible absent of charges in q1 and more additional charges in q2 they what triggered those additional charges and then when you talk about the downside scenario on slide i think previously indiscernible marketing lower should we just take off billion to billion or can you provide the framework around what you think the downside scenario now is and then my second question perhaps i could just invite you to make some comments on the indiscernible 14point plan on cash savings that was released yesterday and any implications you think that might have for your uk business thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay ill take the second but george you want to take the first georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you andrew so we have put in more charges in q2 the total charges was billion or the sum of q1 and q2 q1 being very benign is billion most of these charges are on stage these are more technical adjustments over names that have defaulted so where we stand now in terms of charges is we are comfortable with the charges we have against this portfolio on china cre now with regards to the plausible downside scenario we indicated billion at the yearend as a plausible downside we have indeed crystallized billion of it so without being precise on the math here it is indeed a residual circa billion that remains a plausible downside which may or may not materialize over the coming few quarters noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you and with regard to the fca and the work theyre doing on savings accounts i think was your second question listen we believe in both the mortgage book and the savings the deposit book weve tried to make sure that we are offering a good range of products to our clients whereby they have choices so on savings weve got a good competitive range of fixed rate deposit accounts in the market we also believe weve got good pricing in place for more instant accesstype savings accounts or deposit accounts we will participate with the fca and on any review they do we believe if you take our twoyear fixed rate savings account in the uk based on the yield curve in the uk were offering savers the opportunity to get on that two fixed term two year fixed term savings account if you compare that to our twoyear fixed mortgage products that we are offering hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 to our customers with a loantovalue ratio were in the market at around about and for newtobank customers wed be in the market of about so we believe we have the structure of the deposit book and the structure of the mortgage book in the right level and as ever there is a price difference between term product and instant access products because of their maturity and the liquidity risk so we have tried to price our products fairly and appropriately we are very cognizant of the pressures that uk customers face at this point in time we certainly try to remain competitive and to help them navigate what is going to be a challenging year or so with high interest rates in the yield curve and higher rates of inflation but we will fully participate with any review that the fca take were also trying to encourage through marketing prompts customers to take advantage of those products if they want them and they meet their circumstances now we cant cant and should not force them into term savings but we need to make sure they are aware of our term savings products should they want to take advantage of it so hopefully that answers your question can we take the next question please richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc questions from the floor in hong kong well take two catherine and then nick and then then ill come back to you sam a bit later catherine jingjun li q analyst jpmorgan hi my name is catherine li from jpmorgan and i have two questions one is in a more long term and one is more near term for the longterm questions i will ask management if you have if you can give us any color on potential impact of basel iii reform because i think one of the key support on share prices is buyback and shareholder return right and then i think the impact on capital because of this potential regulatory changes will have an impact on how we model in a future capital return but this is more in long term i understand that i just want to get some color any color particularly after the us regulator release that basel iii end game like how would that change our present forecast on that so this is for the longterm question and then on the nearterm just now i think management gave us a number potential additional ecl charges on chinas cre is billion and then i also noticed that for our guidance for full year credit cost is basis points but if i look at the first half its a bit less than basis points on an annualized basis right so that additional upside on credit costs like have we included that billion or that billion is outside of the basis points guidance thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i think ill take the second one first and then ask george to cover the more technical difficult basel iii question so on the ecl we decided to maintain guidance of basis points on ecl because theres still a lot of economic uncertainty out there theres economic uncertainty around china current real estate theres economic uncertainty generally in the world weve had a good firsthalf performance on ecl and as you say you know billion is below the run rate of basis points so we think we do have some capacity to absorb some of that risk thats inherent in the commercial real estate book in china but i think id be misleading you if everything was so scientifically proven because youve got to it all depends on what happens elsewhere in the world so hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 yeah i could easily say yes weve got capacity to absorb that but it depends what happens elsewhere in the world so but we do believe we have its right to maintain a conservative guidance at the moment on ecls of basis points and we have capacity in the second half relative to the first half performance to absorb some additional shocks should they come through from nearterm economic issues george do you want to handle basel iii georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean just maybe just finishing on the ecl point i would caution you not to annualize h1 if you look at q2 at billion as a more normalized level so that is more a level that you can look at whereas q1 was an unusually quite close so this is why h1 will look low to your taste so on basel iii look so the first thing to share about basel iii is we need to know the final rules at this stage most of these rules are still in draft form and they will remain subject to change as we know the final rule the second thing i will share is that based on the current draft rules in as per our pra standards for the group holdings there will be a minor improvement initially in our rwas but as the output floor starts kicking in years into the journey so from plus years there is a likelihood that the output floor will catch us and netnet the impact may be in a material up or down but in material up as we look at it this way this being said just want to caution one thing the us obviously issued their draft rules last week they came out more severe than we initially expected they will have an impact on our us operations it remains a marginal impact were likely talking singledigit rwa uplift against a possible downward move before that but those rules will impact our local reporting for our us entity well not change the way we report at the group level so we will need to navigate both if you want in parallel noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc over to nick nick nick lord q analyst morgan stanley asia singapore pte thank you yeah its nick lord from morgan stanley again a couple of questions if i may please i think george has given a very thorough description of how you might sustain earnings sort of postreturning rates but obviously a lot of that fee generation is going to come at a cost so i just wondered if i could invite you to talk about how you think of balancing that fee generation with costs over the next sort of two to three years and then secondly a little bit more specific but youre now sort of three or four months into having bought svb you spoke a little bit about it here i just wonder if you could give us a little bit more detail on how your plans have evolved for that business noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah thanks nick and by cost im assuming you mean investment cost to get to it hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 nick lord q analyst morgan stanley asia singapore pte investment costs against operating costs yeah noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah thats fair listen youre absolutely right were keeping a strong and tight cost discipline in the bank but what were doing is were reallocating cost from two and what we were typically reallocating is from what i call bad cost costs that are associated with low returning portfolios low returning business activities in certain markets or costs that are associated with manual processes that should be digitized so if you look at our cost performance i think we increased our investment in it cost by so far this year first half to first half we increased some of our investment cost in our global businesses and we reduced costs elsewhere and thats whats getting us back to the so were investing and saving at the same time and that is a phenomenon that probably historically hsbc is not being greater its typically been cost management or cost investment and its been a cycle you manage costs tight and then you invest were definitely trying to do both at the same time and theres a lot of selffunding going on to try and mitigate the overall cost base and thats how were building out the people in mainland china because were saving costs through other country exits or the market exits reducing our support costs in some of the manual processes in our global processing centers thats allowing that investment to take place and thats been the journey for the past three years on the svb the integration is going well the business weve had no nasty surprises since the day we bought the business it was profitable the day we bought it it is still profitable were going through systems migration at the moment one statistic which is probably an important guide for the future in the three months post acquisition we took in new to bank customers at a higher rate than the three months prior to acquisition so in the transition of ownership from the previous owners to us weve seen an uptick in the momentum of customers wanting to bank with svb in that first three months period that acquisition has also given us the knowledge the platform the connections and frankly the positive brand and reputation globally that has allowed us to go and recruit a team in the us we recruited a team here in hong kong and we recruited a team in israel so my view that there is strong growth prospects in that business not just for the next two or three years im doing this because i think this will be an important business for us in the to to 15year timeframe this is an important sector of the economy and were willing to invest in it so im very pleased with how its going we probably do owe you as an investment community more detail on how material what are the numbers and i think well come back to you at the end of the year with if you add this all together the investment and the current indiscernible business what could that potentially look like going forward and how material is that but that is something if its okay well give you more towards the end of this year with the fullyear results richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks noel back to lines and to tom rayner and then sam will come back in about minutes indiscernible okay operator if you hand over to tom rayner operator thank you we have a question on the line hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc tom operator we have a question from guy stebbings from bnp paribas your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc guy hi guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas yes hi there thanks for taking questions good morning or good afternoon i have one back on cost and then one on specifically in the uk so i mean on costs in the context of a very strong top line and then upgrade to the rote guidance this year and next interested in how youre thinking about investment spend in that context of ph hopefully a better revenue backdrop than you previously anticipated your guidance is very clear for this year indiscernible but next year and beyond also some mindful consensus of fairly modest growth next year from where youre guiding the market adjusting for things like canada so just how indiscernible appropriate you think that is in the context of what is an aggressive top line and given ph all the opportunities available to you and the second question is on nim in the uk you saw very strong growth in the second quarter in indiscernible banking in stark contrast to some uk peers if you could talk about some of the dynamics how youre seeing deposit beta and mix evolving i appreciate its very difficult to be too specific but any sort of perspective there and whether ultimately nim in ph uk retail banking would likely to peak now at this good level thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thanks well certainly on cost its a very simple answer were not giving any guidance at this stage on we will give an update on guidance at the end of the year but on weve given i think a strong commitment on cost discipline i also will maintain strong cost discipline in but im not going to quantify what that means in terms of percentage growth at this stage on the uk george it would be good if you could just share some of the information that weve got on the uk particularly the progress were still making in the uk mortgage market despite the pressures in the uk mortgage market it would be good to put some color on that please georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so guy maybe ill start by talking the dynamic and ill delve into nim specifically but first in terms of passthrough rates on the deposits for the last basis points of rate hikes from the bank of england weve passed through to our savings rate retail saving rate around so we believe from a consumer point of view we are competitive having passthrough and obviously this is a higher than passthrough the overall booked passthrough within the around between and but clearly the marginal passthroughs are higher at these high level of rates equally on the mortgages we continue aiming for market share so weve grown the stock market share from to and our new business market share is now just shy of so hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 we maintain a leading proposition in mortgages now if i go specifically on the nim look without talking to our peers nim some parameters that you can use when youre doing your assessment and your analysis the first one is we have a very strong liquidity position with a very strong deposit franchise and a low loanto deposit ratio the second one to take into account is we are relatively small in consumer finance so that component of our portfolio is singledigit percentage of our retail finance the third one to take into account is that our structural hedging is relatively young ie we started the structural hedging essentially when rates started to be at higher levels so we have little baggage from structural hedging positions from prior ie when rates were very low and this is obviously helping us in adjusting our nim upwards and were not bugged by if you want low interestearning assets from older structural hedges and in terms of expectations i think its fair to expect that the increase weve seen in q1 is unlikely to be repeated as we look into the rest of the year richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you thanks george next question please operator thank you our next question is from tom rayner from numis your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc tom hi tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd thanks very much good morning just on your revised rote guidance for and indiscernible excluding the material notable items understand when i look at your companys consensus you have got material notable items in there i think for instance the sale of canada is boosting indiscernible consensus return so my point i guess my question is i think that that potentially obscures the size of the sort of underlying upgrade that your guidance is sort of return on tangible equity indiscernible my concern is whether the way you indiscernible because the notables now are part of your numbers and therefore i think it makes sense that consensus looks at it that way just wondering whether this presentation is making it maybe more difficult for investors to understand the underlying drivers of the business and whether that may be the effect of your rating at some level i wonder if you could comment on that thinking noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc george you want to pick that up please georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc sure tom so look our rote guidance of midteens initially has been excluding notable items so for this year well for this year obviously we had two notable items in q1 the provisional gain of svb billion but also the reversal of the impairment of the french retail business billion as we look to yearend we do anticipate that we will reinstate this impairment some time in h2 for a possible obviously closure of the transaction on the 1st of january so that notable item if you want washes itself out from our full year expectations as regards i think the canada impact is a couple percentage points on our rote so whether you stretch the midteens hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 a little bit on either side and you may still be right but we would like to take it out because obviously it remains while were very confident in the resolution it remains an element that is subject to additional to continued regulatory approvals so you can do your math with or without noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc so i suppose the way were looking at midteens as if you look at the first half we printed a headline rate of rote if you take out the two notable items you get to an rote we guide in midteens to be equivalent you could say with the number not the number and if you think about therell be a profit on the sale of canada assuming that transaction completes therell be a capital policy around that in the form of dividend and in the form of buybacks but were not including that profit on sale within our guide and were not including that in our definition of midteens thats sort of over and above because so what were trying to say is were giving you a midteens rote guidance for the core business not with the big swings in ma activity achieving it thats the way id look at it so we just want to try and make sure everyone understands what we mean by midteens and it doesnt include the big oneoffs either the oneoff positive or the oneoff negatives were looking at the fundamental business in guiding to that georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc and just adding complementing that were not trying to change consensus at this stage were noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd i mean sort of i mean can i just kind of just come back noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc you can you can tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd just quickly come back on that because i think that the real question thank you thank you i guess my real question is this midteens i mean is this now what you view as more of a throughthecycle type of level of profitability for you guys if you look at consensus at the moment you have that dropping away again hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 because i guess people the oneoffs have dropped out but i mean it sounds to me that you think now maybe interest rates have normalized to a level where thats probably more realistic indiscernible the last decade or so and maybe your profitability in midteens is now what youre comfortable with is that what youre saying on a more of a through the cycle sort of basis noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc i think youve overread it because what weve said is the guidance is for and were not giving you guidance for and beyond we will do that at some stage so i wouldnt overread that but clearly in and beyond youve got interest rates that will start to come off but im also talking about building alternative revenue streams building balance sheet growth because as interest rates come off economic recovery improves and the balance sheet will start to grow again so our job as a management team and our philosophy is we want to try and make sure we can mitigate some of that downside risk either through hedging or alternative growth strategies to stabilize the rote over time but for the avoidance of doubt we are not guiding at the moment on rote were only guiding on and and well have to see how the economy the economics of the world develop and i think george should probably reiterate what he said at the end of that because the line went a bit hazy george on consensus georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc as in look were not trying to change consensus where we see consensus for our rote for and okay tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc a question from the line of perlie mong please noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you next question please operator thank you our next question is from perlie mong from kbw your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah thank you perlie mong q analyst kbw hello i just got two questions the first one is indiscernible noninterest income and especially in wealth in asia so if i look at your asian entity recruiting it looks like revenues indiscernible quarter onquarter but nii gone up a little bit so that suggests to me that indiscernible down the middle hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 just wondering what youre seeing in front line especially with regards to wealth and obviously hong kong gdp print yesterday was quite a bit weaker than expected so just what youre seeing in context and indiscernible expectation about china business to what extent do you think that that might help you and so thats my first question and then the second question is on deposit migration in hong kong because i just noticed in slide it looks a lot like the hang seng which is obviously traditionally very strong retail trading franchise it looks like deposit migration indiscernible is turning the other way so does that suggest that the migration is ph maybe dead in hong kong ph and maybe conking out georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc indiscernible so on the nonnii wealth in asia you will observe actually the biggest pickup is in insurance sorry first taking the impact of funding the trading book which is showing under nonnii and this material is billion if you take this one out the growth is essentially from insurance and insurance in hong kong it does appear under nonnii but not fee income that growth is kind of a reflection of the growth weve seen in q1 its in the to growth yearonyear it is reflective of the opening of the border between china and hong kong and the additional inflow of mainland chinese policy new policies nonhong kong business about of new policies are from mainland chinese as you would expect insurance is a core component of our wealth in particular here in hong kong and thats a main driver of the growth we still see some softness in wealth with regards equities trading and thats more reflective of the equity markets in general and i want to say the while the hong kong gdp is a main driver of our loan portfolios in terms of growth in our balance sheet wealth activity is not necessarily directly linked to the gdp it is linked to investor behaviors and it is linked to sentiment in the market with regard to your second question on migration so in hsbc we continue to see a migration of around per month although it did slow a little bit in april but that kind of continued at a trend that we have been forecasting whereas in hang seng where the term deposit share is in the mid percent our colleagues in hang seng have taken a proactive approach to manage some of the highly rate sensitive deposits and allowed them if you want to accept some attrition against these highly rate sensitive or rate chasing deposits and this is what allowed them to maintain or slightly reduce their term deposit mix theyre benefiting from a very strong liquidity position and a strong deposit franchise and they do not need necessarily highly rate sensitive deposits at that margin richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc thank you weve got a question from sam and then weve got one last question from the lines sam over to you sam wong q analyst jefferies hong kong ltd thank you congrats on the strong results sam wong from jefferies just a very quick question on hong kong mortgage mortgage rate in hong kong right now is well below hibor many smaller banks are actually backing off from the mortgage market so do you see mortgage pricing in hong kong going up and what would be the nim implications for that so thats the first question the second question is on china there are a lot of macro concerns going on right now so how would you navigate through the macro uncertainties as a bank thank you noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay thanks sam do you want to handle the mortgage hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc ill take the first part noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc yeah georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so sam the first our mortgage we continue printing mortgages yes indeed the rates are quite attractive for borrowers and we increased our mortgage book not a smaller not a very large amount but we increased our mortgage book so we continue and this is despite a subdued property sales in hong kong we continue increasing our book the pricing as you know the mortgages are kept and the pricing is highly correlated to the savings rate so for instance last week we increased the saving rate by about basis points on hong kong dollar and automatically increases the cap and therefore the mortgage pricing today by basis points but i see this as a natural evolution with rates not a specific pricing for the mortgages or specific dynamic for the mortgage pricing if you want noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc and in terms of china macro so we had a brief conversation before its if you take all of the international banks share of the corporate debt market in mainland china i think all of us together are about market share so actually growing your corporate banking business as an international bank particularly if your strategy is connecting mainland china to the rest of the world in both directions gdp is not the prime driver of growth in the sense of what you can do because youre still relatively niche in the market and what is a huge market so you can get growth despite the fact that gdp and by the way gdp is still plus so its not bad but you can still get growth similarly in our wealth business that were pursuing in mainland china were pursuing an area which is around about helping internationally orientated personal customers and particularly the domestic customers in the greater bay area get access to wealth products insurance products to help them with their protection needs and their savings needs and that is primarily targeted at the affluent or the emerging affluent sector rather than particularly at the high net worth or ultrahigh net worth now that is the core business we have here in hong kong the way i look at it is that our proposition here in hong kong has been a very strong driver of growth and profitability for hsbc in hong kong while we see that same opportunity in the greater bay area and the engagement in between greater bay area or the guangdong province and hong kong represents a significant longterm growth opportunity for us and what were trying to do which is different to three four years ago were targeting international wealth and insurance as our primary proposition as opposed to just becoming another mortgage provider or another card provider in guangdong province so i think we see opportunity for growth yes you cant ignore the macro environment but we do see conditions for good growth for our business in mainland china all right next question our last richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc last question from joe dickerson from the lines please hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you operator thank you we will take a last question from the phone from joseph dickerson of jefferies your line is open joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hi its a double header from jefferies on qa just a quick question most have been asked and answered just on the dividend question that tom rayner asked the answer was slightly long winded if i interpret what youre saying it sounds like you would like the dividend the ordinary to be progressive and then secondly can you just discuss in the hong kong business of indiscernible business the nim trend that was flat quarter onquarter how much was the us dollar denominated business in play there because if i look at your rate sensitivity disclosures the usd bucket is now looks liability sensitive as opposed to asset sensitive so what how much of the nim movement there lets say in an adverse sense was attributed to the us dollar business or was it something else okay noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc okay let me deal with the dividend one first the guidance weve given is for and will have a payout ratio in addition weve guided to the first use of proceeds of canadas sale proceeds will be a special dividend so were not giving any guidance on whether the dividends is progressive or not progressive were only giving the guidance that weve just said which is of profits clearly as a management team our ambition is to make our profits progressive so thats but were not guiding on dividend as a progressive dividend policy our policy is payout ratio and that will be a function of earnings and george do you want to cover hong kong nim georges elhedery a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc so on the hong kong nim so the first the nii increased by billion but the banking nim increased by billion because the nonnii component of the trading funding increased by billion now the way the nim the bank sorry the way the statutory nim is computed is only looking at the nii component and therefore its showing flat but as i mentioned we will be upgrading our disclosures and enhancing our disclosure with regards to banking nim and that will give you more visibility on the overall margin when you take into account the funding of the trading book now in terms of sensitivity to the usd youre actually also driving towards the same kind of dynamic in the funding with the trading book so dollars has been a currency that we fund a number of our activities with so when you look at the nii sensitivity dollars comes opposite to all the other currencies because thats a funding currency but essentially dollars is funding our funding of the trading book and therefore when you look at the funding book sensitivity weve put in a few kind of few explanations on the slides where we estimated this to be to the tune of billion it is fair to assume most of it is dollars and therefore reverses it and kind of renormalizes our dollar sensitivity overall on the balance sheet to be that of kind of negative sensitivity for minus basis points hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 01aug2023 noel quinn a group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc thank you richard oconnor a global headinvestor relations hsbc holdings plc back to you now noel quinn group chief executive director hsbc holdings plc well i just want to say thank you very much for all of your questions and your time today really appreciate you spending some time with us just to close with a couple of comments weve had a good first six months im pleased with how the business is performing we delivered an annualized return on tangible equity of or excluding those notable items and weve increased
