management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the investors and analysts conference call for hsbc holdings plcs interim results for your information this conference is being recorded at this time i will hand the call over to your host mr noel quinn group chief executive noel quinn group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you sharon good morning in london and good afternoon in hong kong and thank you for joining us ive got ewen with me today and he will present the numbers in detail before we then go to qa let me start by saying that its been another difficult quarter for our customers colleagues and communities but i have been pleased with how hsbc has responded this is still a hugely unpredictable environment we are conscious of that on both a human and at financial level and we are doing all we can to support our customers and colleagues through this very difficult period against that backdrop we are satisfied with our first half performance our asia business held up well and our fixed income businesses delivered strong revenue growth this compensated for challenges in parts of the world that have been harder hit by the impact of covid19 the businesses that performed less well are those we are hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 already changing we will be accelerating our transformation in the second half of the year and making other necessary changes in light of the new circumstances since february theres still a lot of uncertainty around not least from the ebb and flow of covid19 and the steps needed to contain it our improved capital position and excellent funding and liquidity are the hallmarks of our strength and resilience helping us to be there for our customers while also building the future of the firm our focus remains on helping our customers through this immediate period while making the changes necessary to serve them better over the long term the current geopolitical environment is clearly complex tensions between china and the us inevitably create challenging situations for an organization with our footprint but our businesses in asia have shown good resilience and we will face any political challenges that arise with a focus on the longterm needs of our customers and the best interests of our investors turning to our second quarter performance our asia businesses continued to show good resilience contributing billion of reported pretax profit and global markets grew adjusted revenue by our profitability was most challenged in the businesses at the center of our transformation europe the us and the nonringfenced bank which were severely impacted by high expected credit losses overall pretax profits of billion were down and adjusted profits were down on last years second quarter ecls of billion were up on the first quarter reflecting updated forward economic guidance in the uk in particular weve updated our range for ecls which ewen will talk about later the interest rate cuts made earlier in the year began to impact our revenue from march onwards we responded by pulling the cost levers available to us reducing operating expenses by compared with last years second quarter we continue to attract significant deposits in the quarter im pleased to say that our capital ratio increased to providing a strong and resilient platform from which to serve our customers and manage the economic environment turning to slide the resilience of our asia franchise continues to underpin our financial performance this was due to the quality and strength of our business and client list and for the speed and decisiveness of the covid response which allowed many economies to restart sooner than others the activity underpinning our asia performance remains robust weve increased our trade finance market share clients fx volumes are lower but relatively resilient and retail card transaction volumes recovered in june following a dip during the pandemic adjusted revenues in individual markets have been broadly stable despite the economic slowdown and asia lending is up and deposits up in the last months first half expected credit losses of billion in asia included a large single name provision in singapore in the first quarter looking to the second half parts of asia and hong kong in particular have tightened covid restrictions in recent days this is something that were all getting used to as cases rise and fall and we are hopeful that the quick response of the authorities will contain any new outbreak and minimize the impact looking to slide we remain focused on helping our customers colleagues and communities through the pandemic with high operational resilience in the face of unprecedented volumes and customer interaction around of our branches are currently open and all our customer contact centers have been fully operational throughout we have now granted around billion of debt relief for our personal lending customers through hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 more than payment holidays on loans credit cards and mortgages more than wholesale customers have received more than billion of lending support billion of that through government schemes and billion through hsbcbacked lending we arranged more than trillion of loan debt and equity financing for wholesale customers in the first half including more than billion of social and covid bonds we also retained our number one ranking for sustainable finance bonds in a rapidly expanding market weve invested heavily in technology driving digital transformation to connect more customers remotely and increased digital engagement during lockdown downloads of our hsbcnet mobile app for business were up on last years first half the value of mobile payments in the second quarter was up more than on the same period last year and digital wealth sales rose significantly yearonyear up in singapore in hong kong and in mainland china the strength of our covid response contributed to a sharp increase in customer satisfaction with doubledigit increases in several retail markets record satisfaction scores in trade and global liquidity and cash management and global banking and markets being voted number one standout fx dealer for global corporates in the recent greenwich buyside study throughout all this we maintained exceptional balance sheet strength and strong funding and liquidity with a cet1 ratio of and billion of first half deposit growth turning to our transformation program while we slowed progress in some areas in response to the pandemic we laid good groundwork for the rest of the year and well be accelerating our plans in the second half we lifted the pause on redundancies in june and well be moving forward with those plans thoughtfully but purposefully weve already seen around million of cost savings in the first half with a further million estimated in the second half from our transformation activities this is slightly below the billion of transformation savings we promised for this year because of the pause on redundancies but we expect to make up the difference in in the meantime weve taken additional action on discretionary costs and we expect to make many of those savings permanent on the rest of our transformation weve completed the combination of rbwm and global private banking and were making strong progress in the back office integration of commercial banking and global banking as youve seen the areas of weakness in the second quarter were the areas that were already committed to changing were confident that the actions weve identified in february are the right actions to take but were obviously looking at what more we need to do given the changed economic and monetary environment weve created the structures to reduce rwas in global banking and markets and made a gross rwa reduction of billion in gbm in the first half of the year in the us lower interest rates posed a challenge to our us retail strategy and thats something were looking at but the us business has already closed branches and were on track to reduce us global markets rwas by around by the yearend in europe we simplified our management structure and have a new team in place to push through the transformation we remain committed to the europe rwa reduction targets we announced in february and well execute those plans in earnest as the economy starts to recover i want to finish by talking about one of the most exciting growth businesses and thats wealth in we set out a plan to capture the growing global wealth opportunity centered on asia and weve been investing to grow that business ever since in the last months weve grown our jade and premier customer numbers by and our wealth balances by with around half of this growth coming in asia in our asset management business weve grown assets under management by and private bank client assets by over the same period hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 in june we launched pinnacle which is a new platform to significantly step up our wealth business in mainland china this allows customers to access a full suite of wealth services including insurance in one place which is unique for any chinese wealth platform were investing to bring our wealth capabilities to new customers in china and we intend to grow the number of wealth planners in phases over the next four years the greater bay area wealth management connect program which was announced in june only enhances the wealth opportunity and were excited at the chance this gives us to serve more people in the region with that ill pass it over to ewen to go through the numbers ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks noel and good morning or afternoon all given the impact of covid19 our second quarter was tough we had an fall in reported profit before tax and a drop in adjusted profit before tax there were a couple of bright spots fixed income and global markets was standout together with a resilient performance by hong kong and other parts of our asian franchise overall our results were heavily impacted by lower revenues from subdued customer activity in many parts of our business and the building effect of ultralow interest rates the second quarter in a row of very high ecls and a billion software intangible writeoff largely as a result of the weak return outlook for our nonringfenced bank adjusted revenue was down this included a million benefit from volatile items which in part reversed some of the negative impacts we saw from marktomarket movements in the first quarter ecls were up on the first quarter at billion or basis points of gross loans with the largest impacts in the uk in commercial banking weve continued to take action on costs to adjust for the weakened revenue environment our adjusted operating costs fell by against the second quarter of last year despite the weak macro environment our balance sheet metrics continue to improve our core tier ratio was up basis points to in the quarter and customer deposits grew by billion our first half return on tangible equity was thats down from for the same period last year and our tangible net asset value per share of was down on the first quarter due to movements in own credit adjustments turning to slide looking across the three global businesses in wealth and personal banking revenues were down with retail banking revenues falling by million due largely to the impact of falling interest rates on liability spreads at a headline level wealth management revenues were broadly stable but excluding positive market impacts in insurance manufacturing down due to lower sales volumes commercial banking revenues were lower due mainly to the impact of lower margins on global liquidity and cash management and lower volumes in trade finance in global banking and markets revenues were up global markets grew by million which we achieved while keeping traded value at risk broadly stable this included an excellent performance in our fixed income franchises up principal investments revenue grew by million primarily due to a material reversal of the marktomarket losses we saw in the first quarter in corporate centre revenues were million lower with million of adverse movements in valuation differences on our longterm debt and associated swaps just to remind you all that the second half usually sees lower revenues from noninterest income in global banking and markets and wealth and given the buoyant global markets revenues in the first half we expect that seasonality to be more pronounced this year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 on slide net interest income was billion down against the first quarter the net interest margin was basis points down basis points on the first quarter of which basis points came from the fall in interest rates while were beginning to see some modest asset repricing we still expect recent interest rate cuts to have a negative impact of more than billion for with a further significant negative impact expected in turning to slide adjusted operating costs were lower than the second quarter in and down in the first half relative to the first half of as a result of the operational impact of covid19 were spending less on certain discretionary cost line items we expect this to lead to some permanent benefits in our cost structure relative to previous planning assumptions were being disciplined on variable pay accrual in line with lower expected profits this year and weve restarted the cost reduction program that we announced in february at the end of june head count including contractors was down in the last months and down since the start of the year as we signaled at our first quarter results were now planning for fullyear costs to be below run rate as you do your modeling on operating costs for the second half please dont use the first half run rate as a guide second quarter costs were low due to covid19 and we expect both a step up in investment and technology spending and the high uk bank levy due to strong growth in our deposit base on the next slide we saw a further substantial ecl charge in the second quarter some billion or basis points of gross loans ph billion of which were stage and stage charges this reflected extra forward economic outlook charges across all global businesses and regions particularly in respect of the uk in commercial banking uk expected credit losses were billion higher than in the first quarter reflecting the worsening economic outlook of which million of these related to our uk ringfenced bank stage ecl charges were broadly stable at around billion in both the first and second quarters although the first quarter did include a significant charge on a single name corporate exposure on singapore recognizing the deterioration in the economic outlook in the second quarter weve updated our range for full year group expected credit losses to billion to billion given the first half ecl charge of billion adding the current run rate of stage losses for the second half gives a full year ecl charge of around billion the range either side of this broadly reflects our disclosed economic sensitivities the lower end reflects a path closer to our consensus central economic scenario reflecting a strong economic rebound in with some unwinding of the economic adjustments taken todate the higher end of the range reflects the path closer to our downside economic scenario with a much more muted economic rebound in leading to further negative ecl adjustments for forward economic guidance in the second half i would caution that theres remains a wide range of potential outcomes including the risk at the upper end of the range may need to increase further and in that respect i would encourage you to read our expected credit loss sensitivities in the interim report on slide our core tier ratio at the end of the second quarter was thats up basis points in the quarter core tier capital increased by billion this reflected lower regulatory deductions for expected losses fx movements fair value gains through other comprehensive income and a reduced prudent valuation adjustment on the next slide riskweighted assets rose by billion in the first half or billion excluding fx movements this was mainly due to our billion asset side movement mostly relating to first quarter lending growth and also a billion increase from changes in asset quality due to credit rating migration billion gross riskweighted asset reduction program is underway with billion of additional savings from global hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 banking and markets in the second quarter we continue to expect credit migration to cause rwa inflation in the second half partially offset by progress against our gross rwa reduction program so in summary a difficult quarter overall i see bright spots asia resilience and a strong quarter for fixed income but overall many parts of the business were hit by very high ecls and significant revenue pressures as we look out to the second half there remains considerable uncertainty the continuing impact of covid19 the ongoing brexit negotiations and uschina tensions and any impact this has on our hong kong franchise as such its too early to discuss distribution policy or mediumterm return targets and we dont expect to do so until our full year results in february however were pleased that we faced into this uncertainty with a strength in core tier ratio of an extra billion in customer deposits continued vigor in managing our cost base and the benefit of a diversified portfolio of franchises globally noel and i remain very committed to the plan we announced in february mainly a material reduction in rwas particularly focused on the us the nonringfenced bank and global banking and markets with a reallocation of capital towards our strongly performing asian franchise a significant reduction in the operating cost base of the bank and a material reduction in the operating complexity of the bank with that sharon if we could please open up for questions question and answer section operator thank you mr stevenson operator instructions your first question this morning comes from the line of martin leitgeb goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi martin martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs hey guys good morning and thank you very much for the presentation and the remarks and my first question i was just wondering in terms of the tougher revenue outlook youre pointing out i was just wondering what potential offset could this be is there a difference now how you think about the prospects of some of the smaller retail franchises you have and i think you mentioned obviously the revisiting of the us strategy there or could there be other offsets in terms of volume growth or even more pronounced volume growth like in uk mortgages or maybe changes in the way you charge for accounts whether thats current accounts or corporate deposits in order to try to mitigate some of those revenue headwinds and the second question just on capital in terms of core tier trajectory from here i was just wondering should most of the credit migration youre guiding for sort of mid to highsingle digit rwa inflation this year should most of the credit migration occur this year or could this also go well into im just trying to look at the numbers here and the guidance here because it would appear like given your impairment guidance that youre likely to remain well within the mid to upper range of your core tier target range thank you hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay martin thank you let me deal with some of the revenue offsets first and then ask ewen comment on that and the capital position with respect to our us business they actually had a very strong q2 in the us business there their revenue in q2 this year was the highest quarterly revenue since q4 of im also pleased with the way that michael and the team have started to execute on the transformation plan theyve already closed around branches retail branches on the east coast of america which is around about ph reduction and theyve been successful in retaining around about of the deposit base even though theyve gone through that reduction program and theyre also well on track on the cost reduction plans as well where theyve already completed of the planned staff exits and are on track to meet or exceed the goal we set them back in february of this year so progress on the transformation we clearly need to understand the full economic impact of the lower interest rate environment but were committed to transforming our business and improving the returns on a broader basis on revenue were clearly looking at what other options we have to mitigate some of the revenue shortfall from lower interest rates and we see wealth and growth in our wealth business as an opportunity for that and ill ask ewan to comment more on that in detail but were exploring all options to look at revenue mitigation ewan do you want to pick up on that and the capital comment ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah martin so on net interest income i think we are beginning to see some asset side repricing particularly in asia its relatively modest at this point but we do think there is an opportunity secondly we are seeing particularly in hong kong a changing mix back towards current accounts and away from term deposits which again i think its not unexpected given the rate environment but will help alleviate some of the pressure on liability margins on noninterest income what were seeing at the moment is very subdued customer activity which we attribute predominantly to the impacts of covid so i would think coming into you will and should expect to see some recovery in that customer activity were in some of the governmentrelated lending activity for example in the uk weve been taking more of a natural market share weve taken about a share in the bounce back loans a in some of the other lending schemes which is well above our natural market share in commercial i do think in terms of the uk mortgage opportunity potentially we will be relatively cautious there given the outlook for the uk economy i think until we get a better sense of direction of travel on brexit and the other area where obviously we can help offset revenue losses by doing a better job at cost and i think you saw this quarter some progress on that it was an unusual quarter because of covid and the fact that no one was flying a lot of our head offices were largely shut down but we do think coming out of covid there will be an opportunity to make permanent some of those shifts in business operations that were beginning to see on rwas yeah similar to ecls they should peak this year and therefore you should begin to get a reversal in ratings migration into and into i would think although it will lag i think the trends on ecls but we definitely see a predominant theme in the second half of this year as being additional ratings migration pressure which is why were still sticking with our rwa guidance of mid to highsingle digit growth in rwas this year hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 in terms of what that means for capital i think second half of this year obviously we dont expect on the profitability side we dont expect global markets to repeat their first half performance of just over billion they made billion in the second half of last year they and also weve got the uk bank levy and we do think given the strength of deposit growth that weve seen that bank levy may trend up rather than down for us this year so we do think that the balance of that and some additional rwa inflation will mean that core tier should come down between here and the end of the year yeah previously weve guided precovid at the fullyear results we guided a range of to for our capital and wanting to be at the higher end of that range during i think today if we were to sort of repeat that we would be comfortable i think in a sort of to range rather than up towards martin leitgeb q analyst goldman sachs perfect very clear thank you thank you very much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of tom rayner numis please go ahead tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yes good morning everyone noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd good morning can i just ask you please a bit more color on the net interest income guidance its sort of greater than billion looking at the disclosure on page the sensitivity analysis theres been quite a big increase in rate sensitivity both in sort of year one and year two impact and obviously rates have sort of moved down pretty much across the board so has there been any change within that greater than billion i mean from say maybe just a bit greater to significantly greater and just looking into sort of how comfortable can you be now that that will be the trough year for net interest income i mean are we its a little bit hard i know to look out to but would you be confident that some recovery in volume and asset repricing should start to offset the other negative impacts from rates thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so theres no change i think in terms of net interest income guidance for this year you do have to adjust for the shift in dollars fx movements but my only caution around that is obviously hibor has come down a bit further in july relative to the end of q2 that interest rate sensitivity is the interest rate sensitivity from here with lower interest rate so it has gone up because of the flooring effect on some of the liability product but thats if interest rates shift down from here hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 i think you will in some books obviously see a cumulating effect as you can see on those interest rate sensitivity tables so we do think therell be another meaningful net interest income hit in as we ph currently sit as you look out to when i checked a few days ago consensus views on policy rates where they were broadly going to stay at current levels and begin to rise in i would hope by the time we got onto unless youre complete there that you would be seeing sustained economic recovery which means back to growing loan books again asset side repricing coming through more powerfully and therefore yeah the start of a recovery in net interest income tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd yeah okay thank you and just a quick second question so just could you give us any size of the scale of the capital benefits that you flagged are coming through in the second half i think from the software and sme changes material they may or may not be noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah i mean theres a whole bunch of things going on in the second half were expecting sort of core asset growth to be relatively muted youve got some benefit from the rwa rundown program which is continuing probably some modest benefit from net benefit from regulatory changes although we have got some offset going the other way like trim in europe and the dominant theme i think will be ratings migration but all of that is captured into the guidance of sort of mid to highsingle digit rwa growth yeah software is the software intangible is probably yeah no more than basis points benefit to core tier tom rayner q analyst numis securities ltd okay ph lovely thanks a lot operator thank you your next question comes from the line of ed firth kbw please go ahead edward firth q analyst kbw yeah good morning everybody noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning edward firth q analyst kbw i just have two quick questions actually one was just on this nii thing just to get absolutely clear what youre saying if i look at the implied second half from your from the current run rate it looks like your second half is annualizing at around billion so when you say further pressure into is that further pressure from the second half run rate or is that effectively factoring in that pressure youre seeing so i mean are we expecting to hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 see further pressure from here or are we at that right now and its just the sort of annualizing effect as we go into next year that youre looking to highlight i guess that was question number one and then the second question could you just talk a little bit more about all the sort of uschina pressures at the moment and in particular how you expect that to be able to influence the sanctions have you had some chats about it have you had whats the sort of feedback youre getting from chinese authorities et cetera you seem to be in a very invidious position through no fault of your own i might add but i just would be very helpful just to get some sense of how youre thinking about that and how that might sort of play out over the rest of the year thank you so much noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to take the first one and then ill take the second one ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah you can get there various ways but if you annualize the second half as youve set out i think youre sort of broadly in the ballpark of where you need to be edward firth q analyst kbw okay thats great thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc on the uschina pressures i mean as you see from the first half results weve had a very strong performance in our asia business so we and weve had a particularly strong performance in china in the second quarter i think our profit in china in the second quarter was up around about were seeing strong deposit growth in our asia business given the deposit growth in asia in the second half of the year or in q2 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc billion noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc billion so were not seeing any material impact of any sort on our business performance in the second quarter or the first half from the uschina pressures and in respect to looking forward were still committed principally to supporting our customers in all of the geographies that they operate in we believe there is still a strong role for an international bank in meeting the needs of our clients if they want to trade internationally or expand internationally and were very focused on that and its not right or proper for me to speculate on what might or might not happen with regard to sanctions but i come back to weve seen a very very strong performance in the first half of this year from our business in asia hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 edward firth q analyst kbw okay thanks so much operator thank you your next question comes from the line of guy stebbings exane please go ahead your line is open noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi guy guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas hi there thanks for taking the question firstly can i just ask on wealth it was quite a good quarter if we included the insurance manufacturing if we adjust for that i think it was down around about some in the second quarter just trying to think how should we be thinking about that line going forward because it seems theres quite a lot of disruption in that business but i was hoping it maybe is improving versus the first quarter noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ill give you a first response on that is clearly new business activity will be down from normal levels of new business activity so you would have seen a rebound in the financial performance because the manufacturing part of the business had a call back on some of the marktomarket adjustments that were experienced in q1 but new business activity of selling the wealth products would have been impacted in april and may but we saw started to see a pickup in that activity in june so i think that thats what you would have expected to have seen given the impacts of covid ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah weve seen some shifts supported by the regulators to be able to shift some of that facetoface business to the ability to sell wealth product through digital channels but yeah should be a trough year for wealth if you believe in an economic recovery into so and then other things to watch for are things like the reopening of the mainland china border with hong kong which will obviously help as well guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas okay pretty good thank you and then the second question just on costs in the context of the nii headwinds which weve already talked to and obviously a very good quarter down suggests the run rate could be quite a lot more than the targeted plus but youve called out that investments were a bit low in q2 i think q2 was particularly elevated so just trying to gauge how much should we tempering our enthusiasm relative to the we saw in the second quarter thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 yeah indiscernible second quarter yeah effectively most of our workforce roughly out of the employees were working from home no one was traveling office costs central office costs were very low so i would just be cautious that using that as a guidance in addition marketing spend was materially down too because we took a very conscious decision to market less in the second quarter i would think if you and then offsetting that ive said were planning to step up investment spend a bit in the second half we think bank levy is probably going to go up rather than down this year so probably to down for the full year feels better than what you saw in the second quarter guy stebbings q analyst exane bnp paribas okay very helpful thanks operator thank you your next question comes from the line of manus costello autonomous please go ahead noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi manus manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp hi i just had a sort of question about the retail business your big improvement in nps is very impressive i wonder to what extent is the flip side of weaker returns for shareholders customers obviously feel like theyre getting a good deal and you mentioned this noel but i wonder if you could give a bit more detail how might you think about addressing that balance between customers and shareholders in the retail business going forward such that you can boost shareholder returns and maybe spend some of that nps improvement noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc manus thank you im really pleased with the nps performance in both retail and the bank as a whole and i think we look at that very much as a positive i attribute it to two things and that is the quality of the support our colleagues provided to customers in the first and the second quarter of this year they really responded amazingly well with lots of outreach to our clients to make sure they understood where they stood and responded to their concerns plus we put in place some new digital support programs to make sure that we had regular dialogue with them and they were able to transact despite the fact that we couldnt serve them facetoface and id also point to the fact that we provided our customers particularly in retail with circa billion of payment holiday support and our commercial or wholesale customers with around about billion of credit support in response to covid so i think those were the right things to do and i believe supporting clients at a time of stress is a good thing for any bank to do in terms of translating that into higher returns for the future were clearly looking to extend the use of digital and lower the cost to serve were looking to increase further our penetration of the wealth market particularly in asia and to diversify our revenue stream away from pure nim or nim and into nfi sources of revenue and we believe that our opportunity to grow wealth in china is strong and our wealth in the rest of asia is strong and that can hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 lead to higher returns were also looking to improve the returns in our retail business by taking down our cost base ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah manus i wouldnt think the two are inconsistent in the slightest improved nps where we have the highest nps scores they typically correlate with digital distribution and digital distribution as you know is lower cost to serve than physical distribution so actually i view that improvement in nps as excellent and reflects a lot of work that charlie nunn and his team have been putting in to improving the quality of the digital offering weve got and you saw in the slide that noel put up earlier one of the outcomes of covid has been a very rapid acceleration in some cases by several years in terms of digital engagement from our customer base yeah thats both good for nps but it also should be good over the medium term for how we can adjust and accelerate our cost structure manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp so it will be more a question of as you say the cost structure rather than thinking about changing fee structures or anything to help improve the top line it will be about noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc i think its a combination i think its adjusting to the new revenue realities of todays world plus continued focus on cost and continued focus on providing good quality service its a combination of those three things together ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean the thing that we are going to have to think about on revenue manus is just in an environment of ultra low interest rates we are not earning a return on your liability product yeah do we need to think about adjusting some of the cost structure to a more feebased cost structure but were sort of early into that thinking manus costello q analyst autonomous research llp yeah thats what i was driving at okay i look forward to hearing more thank you operator thank you your next question comes from fahed kunwar redburn please go ahead fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd hi good morning thanks for taking my questions just a couple of questions the first one just back to nii i think i heard you say the first half run rate indiscernible broadly correct so i just want to understand why thats the case because hibor looks like its down probably about basis points kind of first half versus where it is right now so how does nii hold up so well in the face of hibor coming down to that extent and the second question i had was just on the uschina situation i appreciate its quite a difficult question to answer but could you give us a sense of how you think profitability might be impacted and where your biggest concerns are when you think about the kind of political noise coming out between china and the us looking at hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 your numbers i appreciate you said deposit growth has been strong but looking forward where do you see the potential risk to your profitability from that indiscernible thanks noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc ewen do you want to deal with the nii question ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah nii we had always assumed that hibor was going to normalize towards dollar interest rates in the second half so that might be the disconnect in your modeling but i dont have the benefit of your model but i think what we said is broadly true in terms of the previous answer to the other question indiscernible fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd sorry as a follow up to that i think your sensitivity saw about a increase in terms of the year two impact on nii versus the year one impact is that a decent kind of way to think about the cumulative hit to year two nii or is there anything to mitigate that size of increase ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah but i think as you think about that interest rate sensitivity its interest rate sensitivity from here ie that weve already had the first half impact on rates so its not a clean read across i think so be careful about how you interpret that interest rate sensitivity because its from here rather than where it was at the start of the year fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd okay thank you operator thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc on your second point i think there are im not going to get into speculation on what actions may or may not be taken between respective governments its not my role to do that at the end of the day im a banker not an economist or a politician but clearly there are potential impacts on general economic confidence from any form of trade tensions and that will have an impact on all financial institutions clearly there is the potential for change in supply chains and over years weve seen many changes to supply chain activity over that time and well continue to respond to anything that comes our way going forward we absolutely believe strongly in the strength of the pegs so we do not see that as a viable risk we believe the peg is strong and is well supported and we see no risk to that and clearly there are the potential for sanctions against individuals or entities but again im not going to speculate whether they will or wont happen or if they do what impact it might have thats not my place to do so i think to be honest ill return back to if you look at the hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 first six months performance its been mainly impacted by covid it has not been significantly or materially impacted by political tensions or geopolitics most of the impact in the first six months is covid related fahed kunwar q analyst redburn europe ltd perfect thank you guys cheers operator thank you your next question comes from the line of rob noble deutsche bank please go ahead robert noble q analyst deutsche bank good morning noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc good morning ewen james stevenson a group chief financial

deduction in capital anymore is that all gone and just to rebuild that as we go forward into whatever it is thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah weve got some disclosure i think at the back of the slide pack on that sorry im just trying to find it but it is a nice slide pack and if not i can get ir to follow up with you robert noble q analyst deutsche bank all right thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc okay next question operator thank you our final question is from joe dickerson from jefferies please go ahead joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 hi just a quick one so youve taken this extra charge provision charge in the uk and noted the downside risk to the economy and i think youve made some similar comments indiscernible q1 about the relative weakness in the uk can you just help me square the circle if i look at your mortgage balances theyre up yearonyear in the ringfenced bank which is like the industry growth can you just help me square the circle between the two views and whether or not you feel like youre being appropriately paid for this risk given your caution around the uk thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc i mean i think the way were concerned about credit in the uk i think is more on the commercial side than the retail side the mortgage book if you look at the average ltv of new lending you look at where their book is overall in terms of the average ltv you look at the returns that were still generating out of that business i think were getting adequately and more than adequately compensated for the downside risks in mortgages consumer debt credit card spending has declined markedly over the last few months as a result of covid and i think folks have been using things like mortgage relief to pay down consumer debt so consumer balances have fallen as a result of that and therefore less risk to ecls its really on the commercial side that i think weve got more sensitivity and you can see that in the overall level of commercial provisions commercial ecls which are over billion in the quarter relative to retail but i dont think the two views are inconsistent at all our sweet spot in mortgage lending is typically prime mortgage lending where we think we are running relatively low risk and getting adequately compensated the other thing id say is you can look at the stress characteristics of our portfolios in the bank of england acs results what you see there is a relatively strong outperformance in retail and still outperforming in wholesales versus uk peers joseph dickerson q analyst jefferies international ltd thats very helpful thank you operator thank you our final question comes from the line of aman rakkar barclays please go ahead aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning gentlemen noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc hi aman aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd good morning good morning just actually ph couple of them have been addressed two followup questions so if you note the comment on the dividend could i ask if you came in at the top end of your ecl guidance i mean there is a chance that you make very very little profits this year i mean you could potentially even dip into being loss making interested if your best guess at the moment was as to whether that may preclude hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 you from resuming a dividend in february if you were indeed loss making or do you think the strong capital wins out and then secondly just on restructuring i mean is it the right read from the tone of everything today is you clearly faced much weaker revenue environment than you thought in february and it sounds like you are doing the work on some additional restructuring youve obviously not provided a new target in terms of cost saves or rwas but is it right to assume that the work is happening in the background were perhaps just not ready to announce something or do you think im just getting a little ahead of myself thank you noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc let me deal with the second one first i mean were clearly committed to delivering on the cost reduction program that we identified in february we also need to reflect the fact or respond to the fact that the revenue is softer now than it was in february and were looking at what additional measures we need to take so youre right to say that were looking at what other additional actions we can take on revenue or cost or capital to improve the returns but weve got no details to talk through on that at this point in time and we have to see how covid develops over the next quarter or two quarters to determine how enduring this revenue position and cost position is going to be but were committed to delivering that which we said in february and looking at additional actions as required ewen on the first point ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so maybe just a couple of other things on i mean covid clearly does open up i think some opportunity and time will tell how permanent some of this is but we talked earlier about the fact that weve seen a substantial acceleration in digital engagement from our customers i think that will allow us to think more carefully over the medium term about some of our assumptions around the mix between physical and digital distribution and also how we work and seek to go back to work as a workforce what that means for our commercial real estate portfolio what that means for previous assumptions on travelling et cetera again i think over the medium term covid has opened up a unique opportunity for us to rethink how we engage and work as a workforce but as noel said its too early to sort of model that out for you at the moment and i suspect by the time we get to full year results indiscernible what we can say around that on dividend i think its also theres two ends of the ecl range i think signal different things the high end of the range means that youre facing into probably other line items being severely impacted because youve got a more meaningful economic recession going on and a much more muted recovery into youre also going to see much greater levels of rwa inflation so its not just the impact on profitability its also the impact on rwas which means your core tier is going to be under a lot more pressure and at the other end of the range youre facing a much more benign stronger recovery into rwa migration will be a lot less and youve got a lot more confidence thinking about the outlook for and at that point so its sort of speculative at the moment we dont know we think were going to learn a lot in the next six months on covid both in terms of the impact of second and third waves on various economies around the world and the likelihood of an effective vaccine in well know where we are in relation to brexit well have had another six months on geopolitics and i think have a much better grounded view on what are the impacts thats having on our business particularly hong kong and thats why we sort of pushed the discussion on dividends to full year results but we clearly understand the importance of it to the equity story we clearly want to return to making hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 03aug2020 distributions again as soon as we can but we dont want to come out with definitive statements until weve got more clarity on the economic outlook were facing aman rakkar q analyst barclays capital securities ltd thats fair all right thank you very much guys noel quinn a group chief executive officer director hsbc holdings plc
