terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator and thank you for joining us this morning q2 was an outstanding quarter in my view as most of you know that have been following us for some time we took a number of actions in early stages of the pandemic like modifying our extended focus on ppnr growth during to ensure that wed be in a position to quickly return to our prepandemic growth trajectory as the pandemic wane i think the first two quarters of would suggest that weve been largely successful in that we begin every quarterly call with this dashboard reflecting our key performance metrics on a gaap basis but as we most always do because there are so many adjustments required in order to focus on variables that were truly managing here at pinnacle ill move quickly to the chart reflecting the adjusted nongaap measures as you can see the second quarter was another fabulous quarter for us linkedquarter annualized loan growth exppp was linkedquarter annualized core deposit growth was linkedquarter annualized revenue growth was and already strong asset quality got even better on a lot of these earnings calls i try to provide more color on all or several of the key metrics that are on this chart but today i want to focus more on the big picture and thats really the speed and the reliability of the growth over an extended period of time look at the cagrs for virtually every important growth metric i think that demonstrates the speed and reliability of our growth even in the phase of the various headwinds weve encountered over time take eps as an example cagr you got a dip in and associated with the covidtriggered reserve bill but other than that the growth is extremely reliable look at the revenue cagr loan cagr the deposit cagr all are very fast all are very reliable most of you know we conducted a threeday orientation program for every single new associate to this firm conducted by me and other key leaders here we invest time to help associates understand its culture why it is what it is and what where it makes a difference its intended to inspire a highlevel of associate excitement and engagement one of the topics that we cover in great detail is how we produce shareholder value the hourlong sessions conducted by harold and is intended to help every single associate personalize specifically what they do individually that increase the shareholder value and the kinds of the things they might do that destroy shareholder value but the principal takeaway we expect every single associate to get is that two things are required for us to produce outside shareholder returns number one speed of growth and number two reliability to grow so how is pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 it that we produce such fast and reliable growth and how is it that we expect to continue rapid reliable growth going forward excuse me even as many of our peers are being overwhelmed by the current headwinds like flat loan demand and heavy payout first of all weve positioned ourselves in fabulous markets with extraordinary sales and growth dynamics most of you heard me talk about our outlook in markets like nashville charlotte and raleigh north carolina greenville and charleston south carolina and atlanta one of the biggest and best markets in the country and of course those indiscernible and growth dynamics are critical to growth its just hard to have a large high growth buying for that large high growth market on last quarters call i talked about the fact that i expected to continue hiring revenue producers in our existing footprint at a rapid pace and if we likely have opportunities to expand in other southeastern markets due to the high level of ma activity and all of the associated vulnerabilities that that creates and so you see here primarily as a result of integration turmoil we were the most desirable alternative for a good number of highprofile revenue producers in birmingham the southeast 13th largest market and huntsville the southeast 13th fastest growing market in terms of gdp i want you to indiscernible our reputation as a highly successful challenger brand to those large regional national franchises caused those frustrated teams to seek us out and im not trying to foreshadow anything in particular here but id be shocked that we dont have more of those hiring opportunities going forward as ma appears to be picking up in the bureaucratic ground as many of our larger competitors continues to weigh on their associates so the markets we currently serve and the markets that are likely available to us over time would suggest an ability to grow rapidly on an organic basis even at a time when many are going to struggle to grow revenue and earnings organically now in my judgment more important even than the size and growth dynamics of our markets is the fact that this firm has been built to create raving fans im confident virtually every bank you listen to will talk about service i know not one arm has ever said were trying to give poor service and bad advice but trust me many do so let me spend a minute on just how differentiated our service and advisors from every other bank in our footprint what youre looking at here is data from greenwich associates the foremost provider of commercial market research to large banks in the united states this stat is based on client responses across our entire footprint that means businesses with annual sales from million to million in tennessee north carolina south carolina atlanta and roanoke so lets focus on the pinnacle line at the bottom of the chart you see the navy blue portion of the bar that of the pinnacle client survey rated as a or a on the question how likely are you to recommend your lead provider to a friend or colleague using a scale of to where zero means not at all likely and means extremely likely so in other words of our clients are highly engaged active promoters trust me thats an extremely unusual level of engagement another rated us a or thats not bad combining the two of our clients rated us a or better on a 10point scale but that that gold portion of the bar scored us a or theyre referred to as passive because while theyre generally rating well theyre not so fired up as to be vocal advocates for you in the market and then that last the red portion of the bar are detractors meaning they rated you somewhere between and out beside that blue bar out beside our bar there you can see a thats the net promoter score the number of promoters less the number of detractors and you see that score is wildly differentiated from all our major competitors in our footprint and not only is that a fabulous net promoter score in the southeast according to greenwich its the second best net promoter score in the country pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 now if you bear with me just another minute here on this slide is not just that our net promoter score is higher its also that banks with the most clients to lose have very low net promoter scores with lots of detractors when you look at the gold boxes at the top of slide you see the top five banks in terms of market share have an average net promoter score of and the top banks in terms of market share have an average net promoter score of one of the top five banks in our footprint from a market share perspective has a net promoter score of and of their clients are actively detracting from their reputation so the banks that have the most share are extraordinarily vulnerable the ph difference between their clients perception of their service versus ours where we have a net promoter score of is ph really wide or differentiated as i say ive already talked about the size and growth dynamics of our market and how they bear on growth but more importantly in our very attractive footprint the banks who currently have the ph share lead are extraordinarily vulnerable so if you think about the speed and reliability of growth which is largely dependent on taking share as opposed to economic loan demand this explains why weve been so successful taking share over the last years while we bring loans exppp on an annualized basis this quarter and why i believe well continue to produce outsized growth for the foreseeable future i know for some net promoter score is seen much more abstract than rotces and efficiency ratios so let me take two minutes see if i can make it a little more tangible for you many of you might be familiar with an app called nextdoor an app that allows neighbors to seek and give tips to each other here in the gray box at the top left of the slide someones looking for a new bank the blue dialog boxes on the right are a sampling of the tips provided by neighbors you can see pinnacle clients raving about pinnacle obviously clients who have been wowed by our service these are promoters at last check there were comments or recommendations on this request pinnacle received the next most frequently mentioned tip received eight now multiply that across our entire footprint and thats what promoters do for you weve achieved that kind of differentiated client engagement because this wowing of clients permeates everything we do in this firm let me take a second to illustrate how it works over the last year or so weve had ample opportunity to talk about our approach to the pandemic it began with an offensive outreach to our clients in the very early stages of pandemic to see if they needed a deferral some clients focused on shortterm asset quality metrics and were slow to defer payments we focused on helping our clients about whom were passionate and as an aside our asset quality performed extremely well but more importantly clients rave this chart shows our relative outperformance versus the large banks with whom we compete here were just comparing each bank percentage of national loans outstanding versus the percentage of national ppp loans originated through this bank most banks were less successful on ppp than the size of their loan book would have suggested as you can see all the large banks with whom we compete underperformed but we outperformed and i believe its because it was a matter of urgency for us to take care of our clients who were struggling it was a cause célèbre in this firm to get our clients taken care of i dont take the time today to develop it fully but greenwich developed a crisis response index to measure how well clients perceived their banks response during the pandemic and in the fourth quarter of pinnacle had the highest crisis response index of greenwichs entire coverage universe pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 in the most recent round of ppp theres been a great deal written about how many applications didnt get processed how many applicants got left at the station there was recently a syndicated article in many of the nations business journals like the nashville business journal as an example where our competitors talk about their dissolution with the sba for cutting the program off leaving them with so many unprocessed applications those comments are listed on the righthand side of this slide my view is that many of them just played ignorant and were offering excuses as to why they didnt get their clients taken care of in the last round of ppp we took applications guess how many didnt get submitted to the sba just this entire firm worked feverishly reallocated available resources knowing that we were competing for a limited pool of funding and we got them all done but so we got of our clients taken care of so on the right side you can see what our clients said about us those are promoters as far as i know theres no chance of creating that kind of client experience without creating a highly engaging associate experience we measure our associate experience primarily via work environment survey of all associates we hold each leader accountable for receiving top box ratings from their associates in other words for each statement that associates are asked to write their level of agreement leaders should have created an environment where their associates rate them strongly agree of the time im not aware of any firms that set that kind of target or achieve that kind of result but even in a disastrous year like handling difficult process and procedural changes quarantines reduced cash incentives and so forth we still hit the top box target thats an engaged workforce one of the reasons that weve created such a high level of trust with our associates is that we operate with a win together lose together philosophy if we earned our incentives we all get paid if we earned diminished incentives we all earn diminished incentives if we fail to earn our incentives we all fail to earn our incentives we win together and we lose together not only has that been a powerful team builder throughout our 20year history but it puts us in great stead at a time like this when theres increased emphasis on equity in of our employees of color feel that management shows a sincere interest in them as a person versus an industry benchmark of of female employees feel they receive a fair share of profits versus a benchmark of of female employees feel that managers avoid playing favorites of female employees feel that promotions go to those who deserve them best of employees of color feel that theyre paid fairly for the work that they do and thats versus a benchmark of and so this alignment that weve created results in extraordinary retention of all our associates which means two things that bear on growth number one since associate turnover is the number one deterrent to give a great service associate engagement continues to create promoters which leads to more organic growth and number two since associate turnover leads to client turnover generally this level of associate retention minimizes client attrition which of course bears on their growth so what im trying to do is bring into focus for you this quarter the speed and the reliability of our growth over time as well as the structural reasons wed expect outsized growth to continue for the foreseeable future so harold let me turn it over to you for more detailed review of the quarter harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 thanks terry good morning everybody were obviously pleased with our second quarter loan growth results excluding ppp average loans were up between the first and second quarters excluding ppp end of period loans at june compared to march were up annualized as to loan yields the yield curve remained volatile during the second quarter and we have mentioned for at least the last two conference calls loan yields will be a fight in we will lean into our relationships even harder to maintain our yields overall loan rates were basically flat with the first quarter but that was assisted by a big quarter and likely a high water mark for ppp forgiveness ppp forgiveness boosted the second quarter yield on ppp loans to from in the first quarter it will continue to be difficult to model loan yields for the next few quarters given the impact of ppp excluding ppp loans our average loan yield approximated compared to approximately in the first quarter so where to from here our market leaders continue to believe that a loan growth forecast excluding ppp in the highsingle digits for to be a reasonable growth target for our firm as always we will lean on our new recruits to give us an advantage on loan growth coupled with our markets which we believe to be some of the best banking markets with many of the best bankers in the southeast were optimistic about our loan growth goals this year we also recently announced our expansion into huntsville and birmingham with seven relationship managers in total we and they are both very excited about our opportunities in these two markets and as to loan volumes we are modeling around million in loan growth this year from those two markets and expecting pl breakeven from our new associates in late as to yields we have some reason to be optimistic that our core yields are stabilizing so additional dilution of our loan yields excluding ppp will likely occur but should slow obviously the yield curve does impact all of this so hopefully we get some stabilizations to help curtail the decrease in loan yields as to ppp yields its anybodys guess and even though we will continue to work our borrowers proactively we dont believe we will see quite the pace of forgiveness in than we experienced in that said since the start of ppp we recorded million in fees associated with the program of which weve recognized of those fees thus far so we still have million in unrecognized fees which we believe will help bolster long yields at least over the near term now on to deposits we had another big deposit quarter but not quite as large as several of our previous quarters core deposits were up almost million in the second quarter weve experienced significant growth in noninterestbearing deposits ending up at billion at quarterend up since the end of last year our average loans to average deposit ratio was up slightly in the second quarter to so we consider that a small victory as this is the first increase in our loantodeposit ratio since the first quarter of last year our average deposit rates were basis points while eop deposit rates were at basis points so we continue to see downward momentum for and look to be around basis points to basis points by the fourth quarter of assuming our shortterm rate forecast plays out for the remainder of this year helping us get there will be about billion or so in maturing cds over the next two quarters that have an average rate of approximately basis points current pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 liquidity continues to gain attention from all banks the yield curve remains on everyones mind we did put some excess liquidity to work this quarter approximately million in additional investment securities we dont currently anticipate any more big security purchases this year as to the interest rate risk management we do have a balance sheet bias today of rates being neutral to up slightly over the next year or two so before all the bond experts beat me up for deploying money in the fixed rate bonds in the second quarter we did execute an interest rate swap on the frontend cash flow of about of those bonds we acquired swapping the cash flows from fixed to variable so our interest so our assetsensitivity position is essentially the same before and after the bond transaction but we did pick up say a basis points in yields over what were receiving on the cash purchases our securities to assets ratio increased to in and we expect that to hold for the foreseeable future our estimate is that peers say banks billion to billion of assets are running a good bit more than that say in the range we continue to look at ways to create increased momentum through deployment of excess liquidity in the higheryielding assets or elimination of wholesale funding sources all those lines and in addition to the bond purchases we made in the second quarter we increased our repo instrument we acquired in the first quarter from million to million in the second quarter as i mentioned last time this repo instrument is secured by the counterpartys investment securities portfolio and yields around basis points we are looking at another somewhat similar repo product but it will likely be somewhat less ph in balances than the repo we have on our balance sheet currently we also reduced our wholesale funding book in the second quarter by almost billion many of you might recall that we bolstered our liquidity at the start of pandemic with additional brokers and other funds by more than billion at this time a significant amount of that has been redeemed we have about million left to redeem this year and million in and additionally we have about million in federal home loan bank borrowings that cost us an annual rate of we continue to explore prepaying those fhlb borrowings but the prepayment penalty remains too rich for us right now lastly we do fully anticipate redeeming million in banklevel subdebt in a few weeks using available cash the subdebt instruments call date was during the pandemic last year but we elected to hold on to the capital at that time and now feel the current environment provides us enough confidence to eliminate this funding which is causing us about annually and indiscernible going to lose some of its favorable capital treatment in the supplemental information weve updated our interest rate sensitivity which with all the initiatives we accomplished in the second quarter points toward increased asset sensitivity in the up scenario as it stands currently we like where our balance sheet is positioned with no big moves planned on our current agenda as the chart at the top left of the slide illustrates our net interest margin after ppp and liquidity was approximately in the second quarter which compares to a similar calculation last quarter at thus our adjusted nim after being up for four quarters in a row retreated slightly but has held steady over the last year or so as to the credit obviously tim is not here but rest easy hes on the job doing what he does best working both our relationship managers and clients and making sure we continue our focus on being a wellrun and very sound financial institution using the big the four big traditional credit metrics of net chargeoffs classified assets npas and past due accruing loans pinnacles loan portfolio continues to perform very well and in many cases these are the best credit metrics weve experienced in quite some time pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 in the second quarter as was the case in prior quarters during covid our bankers and credit teams continued their diligence around conducting thorough credit reviews with particular emphasis placed on nonpast credits our hotel portfolio and credits in the covidspecific lowpass risk grade categories our second quarter credit metrics remained very encouraging as noted on the slide net chargeoffs are running at a respectable basis points our classified asset ratio declined to a very strong npas also decreased this quarter down to basis points and past dues were down to just basis points which collectively points to the great effort our relationship managers and credit officers across our firm keeping a strong focus on settlements many of us appreciate that in order to obtain these sort of credit trends it takes discipline and active management during the second quarter our relationship managers and credit officers not only experienced an uptick in credit requests and loan growth they also worked to see all four of the major credit metrics improve as well great work everybody our credit team continues to bounce back and forth between offense and defense as they work diligently to assist our relationship managers in structuring new loans appropriately as well as maintain an alertness toward the existing portfolio and looking for any trends point towards incremental deterioration tactically during the second quarter the credit team essentially accomplished the detailed credit reviews aimed at hotels and nonpass exposures for the second half of the year our attention will remain on the covid segments particularly hotels again its a good report on hotel occupancy revenue per room average daily rate all trending in the right direction as to occupancy we continue to grow at about higher than national rates with our hotel portfolio seeing occupancy through the first two months of the same quarter we expect june occupancy to be even higher as the national occupancy rates trended up in june as well if you recall we downgraded all our hotels to criticized last spring at the onset of the pandemic its now time to review what has transpired and begin to look to establish upgrade targets over the next few quarters our credit officers have initiated a hotel upgrade plan for our criticized hotel loans as such the credit officers will be looking to support operating trends over the last months and the ability to meet minimum ppnr debt service coverage ratios hopefully we will have another good report for you on hotels at our next call in october as noted on the slide we expect continued reductions in our allowance to total loan ratio over the next several quarters as the overall economic outlook continues to improve and our covid impacted loan segments continue to trend positive all in all pinnacle credit metrics have held up really well and even though we have shifted back to a more offensive stance we will continue our thorough defensive work particularly in the covid impacted segments now to fee income well lots of good news here for the quarter fee revenues were up more than over the same quarter number of last year wealth management which is investment services trust and insurance had a great quarter in comparison to last year up more than we continue to be very active on the hiring front across our franchise particularly as we continue to build wealth management in the carolinas and atlanta and eventually birmingham and huntsville you might think that we were disappointed in our mortgage results for the second quarter quite the contrary mortgage has had a phenomenal last four or so quarters at million for the second quarter we are pleased and believe we have an excellent chance on holding that run rate for the rest of the year assuming the rate environment holds pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 sba loan sales had a great quarter and were optimistic that this business should hold for the remaining two quarters of this year we also had a great quarter with respect to our equity investments excluding bhg one of our investments completed a followon equity raise during the quarter the results of which provided us significant insight into an updated valuation of that investment and thus we booked a million increase for this one investment ill talk more about bhg in just a second as to expenses specifically incentives i think everyone is familiar with the impact of incentive costs to our expense base and if our earnings hit our targets costs go up if not costs go down last year we did not hit our targets thus and sales were significantly below expectations with our eventual payout equating to of our targets we cant fully anticipate based on the current operating environment that will come back strong and hopefully our associates will recoup some of the lost incentive from along those lines weve provided an opportunity in for our associates to earn an outsized incentive as much as of target however and as weve said repeatedly theres no free lunch increased incentives only occur if our earnings growth supports the incentive additionally we anticipate max payout retreating back to the traditional of target in all in incentive costs are higher than anticipated this quarter as we gain accruing at the maximum award for thus we experienced a catchup from the first quarter we believe the incentive costs for third and fourth quarter will be slightly less than the second quarter as to our overall total expense run rate we now believe that expenses for the third and fourth quarter should be flat to down from the amounts we booked in the second quarter quickly some comments on capital i mentioned the sub debt we mentioned earlier we also intend to redeem another million in sub debt issuance later this year so well work with our regulators on that matter after the next over the next few months and as i mentioned last time and i want to just reinforce the point weve intensified our focus on tangible book value growth by adding a peerrelative component to our leaderships equity compensation plan were currently calculating an annualized increase of in our tangible book value per share thus far this year our plan is designed that we will compare our tangible book value per share growth with that of our peers along with relative return on tangible common equity and relative total shareholder return in determining the vesting results for our core leadership as to our outlook for the rest of i wont go into the slide indepth as weve covered much of this previously so this again is really a summary of for the model builders of what we currently believe obviously we realize that we appear more optimistic than most that said we have great confidence in our people our markets and our clients and renewed optimism about where pinnacle is headed now bhg this is a slide that weve shown for several quarters the blue bars on the chart are originations with record demand set for the past four quarters in fact theyve almost doubled loan originations over that time period bhg would also tell you that their market share is less than so we believe much room for growth as their research would indicate that the personal small and midsized business lending home improvement and patient finance businesses are collectively at billion annual loan origination business and bhg intends to be competitive the green bar represents loans on which gain on sale has been recorded as these loans are sold to downstream banks this is the traditional bhg model which generates revenues associated with their gain on sale model pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 as to the bottom left chart borrower coupons have fluctuated only slightly over the last few years ending at for the second quarter bank buy rates fell to new records at just under in the second quarter so net spreads remained in the mid and highs which over time is up from previous years as noted on the text on the slide bhg executed on their securitization in the second quarter last year the first securitization was approximately million this year securitization approximately million they also are looking to conduct another similar style securitization before the end of doing this allows them to take advantage of somewhat very attractive funding rates as well as diversify both the revenue stream and funding sources we consider the diversification strategy a good idea even though the gain on sale model results in more near term earnings for bhg ive noted that bhg is rapidly approaching a revenue split between the gain on sale in all balance sheet models and believe in they could in fact be there much sooner than we anticipated the bottom right chart now shows over banks in bhgs network and almost individual banks acquired bhg loans over the last months again one of the strongest funding platforms for a gain on sale model in the united states as to credit weve updated bhgs recourse obligation chart on the chart on the left the green bars detail loans that bhg has sold in the network of community and other banks which currently amounts to just over billion in credit sold through their network the blue line on the chart details the recourse accrual and the percentage of outstanding loans with these other banks as noted the recourse obligation is a reserve for future loss absorption as noted on the chart during bhg increased their reserves in anticipation of potential losses from the pandemic with the reserves standing at of outstanding loans at yearend during the second quarter of and as a result of a better outlook bhg decreased the pandemicrelated reserves in the second quarter as a percentage of loan it was down approximately basis point as noted on the chart at the bottom right the trailing 12month losses landed at basically consistent with the last few years and indiscernible where who knew how covid would impact loss rates this chart has also been updated from our previous presentations to better split the actual credit loss from losses bhg absorbs from reimbursing banks for the unamortized premium the acquiring bank pay to get the loan as the chart indicates the prepayment portion has gotten somewhat larger over the last few years keep in mind prepayment losses are for good loans that are just paid off prior to maturity this could be attributable to several reasons but primarily the actual premium paid for bhg credit has gotten somewhat larger consumer credit which is occupying more of bhgs business tends to have a higher prepayment track record and loans are being paid off earlier as rates have decreased weve again updated these two charts the quality of bhgs borrowers has improved steadily in the past and over the last few years bhg continues to refine their scorecards and increased the quality of its borrowing base again the right chart and as ive said before maybe even the most powerful chart i have to offer related to bhgs steadily improving credit quality looking at losses by vintage losses continue to level out in earlier months from origination thus point toward a lower loss percentage over the life of the underlying loan the quality of the borrowing base in our opinion is very impressive and much better than just from a few years ago lastly we see yet another great had another great operating quarter in the second quarter and exceeded everyone expectations yet again weve upped our expectations for now expect in to produce outsized growth in relation to of approximately compared to our prior estimate of to or more we are also adding a growth factor for of approximately thus no rest for the bhg as they continue to build a strong and more revenue diverse franchise as the slide indicates theyve got more ideas theyre in some phase of development which should foster continued growth over the next several years all in we believe pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 pnfp had a fabulous quarter and one that continues to give us much confidence that our franchise and its people are poised for outsized growth for the foreseeable future with that operator well open it up for any questions question and answer section operator thank you sir the floor is now open for questions operator instructions our first question is from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan your line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning steve harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so the pace of hiring seems to have picked up pretty nice right revenue producers added in the quarter is this a function of you guys having more of an appetite to increase hiring here or are you just seeing more opportunities from other banks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats a great question the short answer is we are seeing more opportunities from other banks i think you probably heard us talk about this our approach to hire revenue producers thats sort of the top of the waterfall for us and weve i would have said all along weve got an unlimited appetite we have experienced people that were confident can move large boats of business well hire as many of those as we come across as many of those as we have opportunities to hire but the case is that we are finding greater opportunities to hire people and as i said there in the comments steve i think a lot of that is tied to ma activity and just the frustrations that go along with being acquired it may be in the case of some moes just in your market you have to be on the wrong end of the stick there if you will and so thats creating a lot of opportunity and then i think a couple of big banks were just in a difficult spot whether its with regulators or whatever but the bureaucratic ground is really working on their people and so theres a lot of vulnerability that comes out of that pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful thats good color yeah im curious if we look at the revenue producers that you onboarded over the past two and a half years given that weve basically been in a pandemic for about half the time theyve been at your bank as the economy now more fully reopens right people are getting back to in person meetings are you starting to see an acceleration in terms of that group being able to move the relationships over to pinnacle m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i cant give you a definite answer on that statement and i have i dont have the data just yet to say that for sure but that is my intuition i think a lot of the growth is coming from new hires moving their books to thats a large part of what the growth is and i do think its a true statement that during the pandemic people were they were able to move business but definitely had a longer sales cycle and it took them longer to get it done and so that growth was somewhat retarded during the pandemic and so our expectation is that it should pick up steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and thanks and just finally on bhg with quarterly originations as harold pointed out running at times the prepandemic level what would explain that and is it sustainable thanks m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah steve ive had quite a few conversations with bhg about that they believe its very sustainable they attribute the growth rate to better analytics theyve hired more people in their analyst group they think theyre going after a market with much more pinpoint precision and believe that theres plenty of business out there for them to go try to target so relaying what theyve told us and then looking at what theyre ascertaining for the rest of this year and next year were pretty excited about what theyve got in front of them steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks for all the color m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator your next question is from stephen scouten from piper sandler your line is open stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 hi steve stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co so i wanted to dig down into loan growth a little bit looked like the ci growth was particularly strong which has always been one of your strong suits but im wondering if theres been any changes as the bank has grown have you had to look at larger loan sizes or is the balance sheet becoming any less granular over time and then also the growth in consumer real estate looked like a lot of that from nashville so if you could just dig down into what youre seeing on the loan growth side a little bit more m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think there were one or two larger credits call it million million in the first quarter that came i mean in the second quarter that were booked that helped bolster loan volumes but i wouldnt think that thats any different than call it over the last several quarters theres always been some larger credits mixed up in there as to consumer real estate we are seeing some increased traffic with respect to that product were seeing with where the market is right now and nashville particularly i think is unique in some respects with a lot of smaller businesses and also with call it sons and daughters of clients that are looking to get into the house get their first home acquired or otherwise buying a house that they may not want to go through the traditional mortgage market with and so we accommodate them as do i think a lot of other banks with particular products designed to meet that need and so i think thats whats causing some of the increase particularly in nashville harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc steve i might add to that i do think its important weve not increased our house limits in years and so again theres not a intentional intent to drive credit sizes larger and were always cautious about that game because obviously particularly if you talk about upper middle market credits the higher the credit size generally the lower the rate and so forth so anyway i would just say weve not increased our house limits or done anything that would cause us to focus on higher tickets in particular stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co great harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc and i might add to that steve for whatever its worth i think in our north and south carolina footprint and lets call it the old bnc footprint their growth was very strong i think rick callicutt might tell you that it was his best loan growth quarter in the history of him running that organization there and you can see that it is more skewed towards ci which was what our thesis is dont screw up their cre business but indiscernible ci business and so were getting increased activity in the ci sector there stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 got it okay and then it looked like commercial construction picked up a good bit in the quarter as well and im just kind of wondering what you guys are seeing in terms of new projects coming online if youve seen a material pickup there kind of your customer sentiment and new investments in some of these projects harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont know if theres any significant new projects we are seeing some come across but i think a lot of the construction funding that was in the second quarter were projects that had worked through their equity phase and now theyre into where theyre using bank money to fund the additional construction requirements so im not maybe terry has got some updated information on that but i dont we dont see theres obviously some in coming traffic with respect to multifamily and warehouse were not seeing a whole lot of additional requests for call it hospitality or spec office stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then maybe last one for me just kind of thinking about the fees for a minute i think you guys said you would expect mortgage to kind of be similar to this quarter in the back half of the year but if im looking at your slide i guess its slide it looks like production and even gain on sale margins are still fairly well elevated to levels so im just kind of wondering why that revenue would kind of decline more to a or sustain at a more sort of level if thats the case m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well we think theres a lot of things going on in mortgage right now theyve had a great last year or so theyve produced a lot of revenues for us but the housing markets i think in our most vibrant markets call it nashville raleigh charlotte atlanta the inventory is really getting depleted and then theyre finding a lot of cash buyers and so the mortgage tickets are either nonexistent or reducing and so were trying to kind of anticipate that a little bit here going into the last part of the year which typically would be slower harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i see the i think the other aspect of that is compared to were in markets that werent in like atlanta birmingham and huntsville and if you looked at the number of mortgage originators theres an incremental head count versus so weve added origination capability stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay yeah thats a great point okay well thats great and then sorry maybe one last tackon just the sba run rate did look like it jumped pretty significantly in the quarter is that sustainable or is that more kind of a onetime increase on some built up production on balance sheet that you sold off m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah that runs through rick callicutt and had a couple conversations with rick about that he believes its sustainable he believes well therell be a big kind of a congressional proposal here over the next month or so right now we can sell up to of the loan from ph and we believe in the next month or so pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 were hopeful congress will renew that and extend it so were hopeful for that and because that would play into that assertion about maintaining that same volume here over the next couple quarters stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect thanks so much for the color guys and congrats on all the continued progress m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks steve operator our next question is from jennifer demba from truist securities your line is open jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc hi good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jennifer how are you jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc im great how are you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good great jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc so a question on question you hired some revenue producers in birmingham and huntsville could we see more hires in what are currently nonpinnacle markets in the coming months and quarters as you guys as you indicated before i guess youre seeing more proactive incoming calls people interested in working for you m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think the answer to that is yes jennifer indiscernible in the comments or not i dont want to necessarily foreshadow that we will go to additional markets but on the other hand id be shocked if we dont have other opportunities going forward i think your take on our sentiment is that its right that theres increased vulnerability and we are having more people reach out to us and so forth so i expect i dont have a market that were ready to announce but id be surprised over the next months if we didnt have one or two jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 could those options stretch out over the texas or other markets we might not necessarily think indiscernible m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think so jennifer i may not i dont want to rule texas out because its a fabulous market there might be a day in time when want to go there but ill just say most of the thrust and most of the energy right now i would classify is in the southeast and so again i think its markets east of us and south of us and indiscernible jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay and when youre hiring how much wage pressure are you seeing right now m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i would say we are seeing a little wage pressure but at this point i dont see it as overwhelming in the hiring part of the equation but i think youre on the right track in that we have to work hard theres sort of two aspects to it one is offense and one is defense so were constantly on offense trying to hire new people were also constantly on defense trying to protect our associates and so we do see some pressure as people come after and target our associates we dont let them were not likely to let get associates get away and so you do see some price pressure there jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks guys operator your next question is from jared shaw from wells fargo securities your line is open jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey guys good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey jared harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess maybe sticking to the theme jennifer brought up when you look at slide there is a lot of florida markets in the southeast do you think that as you go forward over the next few years you can sort of pick off pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 those markets individually with the same strategy you did in atlanta or is that a is that an area where you really need to start thinking about potentially doing some type of a deal to get into those markets and hit more of them at one time m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah let me see if i can be clear on that one is we like the top markets in the southeast period which as you say a good number of them are included in florida and so those are attractive markets to us i think the second thing i would say is i tried to be clear although evidently was not clear in our last call that i think ma is on the table what ive tried to say to people is the only reason i say its on the table is because ive said before it was not on the table and so im really just trying to say hey look ive said we wouldnt do it im saying we might do it but all that said that is not the most likely path for us the most likely path i love de novo starts and i think the opportunity for de novo starts are perhaps better now than i ever remember them and so to jennifers question we are having people that are reaching out to us and the more people that reach out to us and if we hire the more that creates a dialog that opens opportunities for other markets and those kinds of things so i guess jared in trying to be as direct as i could be i dont want to rule ma out but i wouldnt view it to be the most likely the most likely is we would extend on a de novo basis and i do believe were likely to have some opportunities over the next few years in kind of most of those top markets jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc thats great color thanks and then shifting over bhg as bhg sort of expands their mandate and grows beyond first the medical professionals and the licensed professionals into these newer areas are the bank buyers do the bank buyers have the same appetite for that new form of customer or do you expect that that paper is going to be what really fuels future securitizations harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well i think theyll pay for leftright leftright through securitization and gainonsale carefully i will speak into the individual that runs their outplacement group the person that positions loans with other banks and he told me i guess this was four five months ago that he could put through that pipeline so theres plenty of appetite thats available to bhg to run loans through that gainonsale model but that said i think they still believe that revenue diversification and funding source diversification is where they want to go i think a split maybe where they think theyll end up and start maybe with less frequency going to the balance sheet model just to kind of just because i think at that time theyll be pushing more loans through gainonsale so the great point in all this is that they have the option they can always reduce their appetite for the balance sheet model and run more loans through gainonsale and thus generate more nearterm profit if they so desire but as it sits right now theyre trying to get to that split jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 okay great thanks and then just finally for me harold you talked about the maturing cds coming due over the next two quarters should we expect that you just sort of let those run off and cd balances decline and potentially cash balances go down or will most likely be renewed into a lower ph amount harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc well i think theres million or million of that thats in the wholesale group so those will get redeemed but the rest are clients cds and we fully intend to renew those and so theyll probably get renewed down into the call it the basis point category somewhere along in that line jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator your next question is brett rabatin from hovde group your line is open brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi brett harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc wanted just to talk about the guidance for a second on nii and i realize that the ppp income is likely to impact the margin negatively in the back half of the year and its hard to predict what that income will be but it would seem like your guidance around nii approximating the first half of the year could be conservative just kind of given the growth or it essentially implies that the margin pressure could be like basis points or maybe a little more harold can you maybe just walk through how youre giving that guidance and the components of it harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah sure we first of all youre right on your point about ppp we dont anticipate nearly the revenue traffic or revenue flow that we got in the second quarter in the third and fourth quarters the round two loans are the ones that will have most of the forgiveness opportunities here over the next call it three or four quarters they have an extended tail theyre fiveyear credits its all that kind of stuff but we will work with those borrowers and try to accelerate ph and give as best as we can with that said im ive got currently an basis point kind of deposit rate right now on my deposit book i think its going to be a slower more methodical downdraft on that to get to basis points to basis points over the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 next quarter or two so i dont have have the same opportunity that i had in the earlier part of the year to get any kind of additional momentum out of interest expense loan yields we think theyre going to hold we hope theyre going to hold theres probably some more downdraft there but all things considered brett we just believe that the second half of the year my nii number ought to be fairly close to what my what the first half of the year ph on my was brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc does that make sense brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc yeah yeah i know theres a lot of moving pieces to it so i understand the guidance the other thing i wanted to ask was just youve had questions around bhg and sustainability of the recent trend and production is actually typically their strongest quarter was there any inkling that maybe pull forward some volume from or can you talk maybe about just thinking about obviously really strong numbers but it would seem like is typically where you really have the growth any thoughts around seasonality m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ive got no feedback from them on that point i dont think there was any pull through volume into i dont think there was any kind of acceleration there so we believe that they gave us a kind of pretax growth number this year so based on what were seeing thats very doable brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay great congrats on the quarter and thanks for the color m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thanks brett operator your next question is from catherine mealor from kbw your line is open catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 hey catherine m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc maybe one question on credit theres a lot of conversations today about reserve levels kind of heading back towards the day one cecl number which i think for you is about basis point how do you think harold about do you think that feels low do you feel like youll get that level or where do you feel like indiscernible the reserve ratio may bottom harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont know i dont think well get that low catherine to be candid when were in that area our reserve levels were at the low end of the peer group so were not targeting anywhere near that number but we do think weve got some more room to go with respect to our allowance weve been able to march it down so far and we think were going to be able to march it down some more but i dont think well see that basis point number youre talking about catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then back to the question on the nii guidance in the back half of the year is there any kind of change to excess liquidity incorporated into that guidance or how should we think about the size of the balance sheet outside of just the highsingledigit loan growth harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think my balance sheet will come up some over the next two quarters weve got some opportunities to get some more wholesale funding off our balance sheet so thatll be thatll come into it but were not looking to do another big investment securities kind of transaction here in the second half well just try to maintain what we have catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it so still core nii should still be up its just really lower ppp that is driving the second half of the year to be kind of equal to the first half of the year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats it catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 okay got it and then one last one if i could any updated thoughts on how bhg is thinking about a liquidity event and what are their kind of pros and cons in thinking about the timing of that for this year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think like weve said all along they continue to study the markets and like we said theyre having fun but theyre not doing it for fun theyve increased their sophistication around whether the hedge funds or spacs or ipos or whatever so there will be a liquidity event im not sure when its going to be but the two founders that remain in the company that have significant they believe equity tied up in the company will want to see a liquidity event at some point and its hard you just cant blame them for that we just dont know when its going to occur they its their company they get to kind of make those big decisions we speak with them about it periodically and but so far so good the runway for growth for them appears to be pretty long catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats helpful congrats on a great quarter thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator our next question is from brock vandervliet from ubs your line is open vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc hey guys its vilas abraham for brock just a follow up on ci just on utilization what are you guys seeing now relative to prepandemic levels has there been any kind of bounce there and what are your assumptions in terms of the highsingledigit loan guide as far as that goes harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah thats a good question were not seeing any kind of increased utilization from commercial ph lines its still pretty flattish over the last two quarters so and were not anticipating that moving significantly over the next two quarters so i dont know what you might be hearing from other banks but for us its kind of a nonevent right now vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc okay and then just beneath the surface on that cre portfolio is it still payoffs there thats driving some of the pressure and just competitive dynamics overall any commentary there harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we had another kind of big quarter for payoffs in the second quarter we just have to have enough new business to overcome it but it was it did accelerate some in the second quarter and commercial real estate was part of it so i think the commercial real estate guys would tell you that they are seeing increased payoff traffic pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 with projects for department of finance a lot sooner i think thats just kind of the environment were in and we want to stay in terry i dont know if youve got any m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats right theres an immense amount of money available for permanent financing and so generally most of our bank borrowers who are here on a recourse basis like to get an end to the longterm product without recourse and so theres a ton of that money available right now vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just maybe one more on deposit growth pretty sharp contrast in risk bearing deposit growth versus i mean noninterest bearing you know just outside of the cd paydowns is there anything special going on there that we should be aware of in terms of that divergence harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think theres anything we typically have towards the end of the quarter some larger deposits come into the bank but im not aware of any big ones this quarter that i can kind of think about that come to mind right now vilas abraham q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks guys harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator our next question is from michael rose from raymond james your line is open michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys how are you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc good how are you michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc good hey just following up on the catherines bhg question and the liquidity event is there any reason you know you guys has spent a lot of time with this business you watched it grow and indiscernible has been a great contributor for you i mean if there were to be a liquidity event at some point in the future would you guys consider just buying the whole thing just given all the positive benefits that its brought it seems like it would be a good fit just given your investment and what its done for the company pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think on that michael i always hate these questions would you ever go you know when you get in then indiscernible never do something thats not a good spot to be in so i dont know so indiscernible we would never do it ph i would have said this our motivations have always been as weve had discussions about that topic in the past is that there are two things that have been important to us in terms of how we have liked our current ownership interest being less than majority interest one is we like those guys having more stakes than us thats a good spot because theyre really good at it and we will make sure theyre as interested as we are in its ongoing success and two honestly we like the equity method accounting treatment and so indiscernible buy more or all of that would change all that and so forth so anyway i dont mean to give a coanswer those are the reasons that weve structured it the way we have they seem to continue to make sense to me but i wouldnt want to rule out and say i will we would never consider that michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and maybe just as a followup back to loan growth obviously great momentum this quarter youve made a bunch of hires you reiterated the high kind of singledigit growth for this year and i understand obviously this high is going to take time to ramp and everything like that but any reason to think that that outlook wouldnt be conservative and as we get into next year and hopefully the economy continues to strengthen that you wouldnt be above that thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think obviously where the economy did strengthen and economic loan demand pick up that would be a boost to what we think we could produce were relying on modest economic loan demand and primarily market share movement right now the market share movement component shouldnt change drastically but if the economic loan demand portion changed up then that would increase the likelihood of loan growth michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thanks for taking my questions harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right see you michael operator our next question is from david bishop from seaport research partners your line is open david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc yeah good morning gentlemen pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi dave m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey dave david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc hey harold a quick question i wasnt sure if i heard this right but in the preamble did i hear that that one of the equity investments that you had evaluation gain on or appreciation this quarter gave you a little bit of an insight into your updated bhg valuation if so if i heard that right could you any color you can provide around that number harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we had we run i dont know how many we have maybe or kind of investments in venture funds and other kind of indiscernible investments in addition to bhg bhg is by far away the most significant and largest so but we have others that we invested in over time and one of those funds had a at a company a portfolio company they developed a product and as a result of that product indiscernible and as a result of that they did a followon offering and now evaluation for that portfolio of company went up basically and we got to participate in that and so that was the ph million i think we mentioned or sort of like that in the press release because there were other companies that also had enhanced valuations and so the ph million was just the biggest one of that that 3point whatever it was in the press release m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc but david if i understood your question i think you thought that harold was indicating that that gave further insight into the bhg valuation and david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc thats correct m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think thats harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc no no thats not the case two separate pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc okay got it got it okay i misheard and then turning to loan yields just curious within your various markets here if youre seeing any opportunities for better or even conversely are you seeing a more competitive pricing just curious how pricing is shaping across your various markets harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah ill start let terry kind of finish but loan yields are indiscernible and have been for the last couple of quarters we cant get a yield curve that kind of that stays stable for fixed rate credit so we need that to occur but other than that its just were negotiating as hard as we can to keep those loan deals where they are m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think theres i dont think its a lot indiscernible harolds sort of said were pushing hard trying to keep the accountability and pressure in the system to do the best we can on pricing but its going to be a slugfest i think for the remainder of the year theres a lot of money indiscernible on limited number of deals so david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc got it then one final question and i realized payoffs and there can be some diverse granularity here but i noticed that memphis has been down here the past couple of quarters and obviously theres a lot of ma in the background with that market just curious any color you can provide on that market and how you view that market holistically overall thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc david i couldnt quite understand the first part of that question are you asking for color commentary on the memphis market david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc correct harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah well our we like the memphis market i think we believe we have and can continue to produce outsized growth there were making really good headway weve done well on the cre segment for some time but were making really good headwind on the ci segment and so weve had a good number of relationship managers the national advisors as we call them in that market likely ahead most markets and we expect that to continue to produce outsized growth pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 david j bishop q analyst seaport global securities llc got it appreciate the color harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator our next question is from brian martin from janney montgomery your line is open brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning guys harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey just one followup harold on that balance sheet question earlier i guess did you say it was your expectation was that it was up the balance sheet would be up up slightly or down slightly it was down slightly harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc up slightly over the next two quarters brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc up slightly okay all right harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah and were trying were trying to limit that as much as we can so well try to get rid of our wholesale deposits that come due and well work with other depositors and try to get rates down as fast as we can brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah okay and then just to be clear on the ppp i appreciate the comments on being less the next couple of quarters but your expectation would be that the majority of that million or so is likely collected in back half of the year i mean some of it bleeds into next year but the bulk of it your expectation or you hope to get it this year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2021 yeah we should be at most of the million thats left in the next two quarters but that will be as you schedule it out will be less than what weve collected in the second quarter part of the third and fourth quarter will be less than whats in the second quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you yep okay and then you talked about the plan on the hotel upgrades i guess it sounds like theres some pretty good opportunity for upgrades in the next couple of quarters i guess if that plays out is that how you think about it and i guess and returning the classifieds and criticized and kind of bakes into the reserve release continuing harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think yeah that will have something to do with the reserve release but we should expect some upgrades this quarter but i think most of the upgrades will likely be in the fourth quarter and the first quarter of next year because some of those hotel loans went through a modification process and i think the due dates for that or maturity dates on those loans are coming up here in the fourth quarter in the first quarter brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay thats m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc brian i think the other thing that might be important there is that its very few of those loans are classified assets vast majority are criticized assets and so were expecting the migration from criticized to pass brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay i appreciate that terry and then maybe harold just outside of the nii guidance just the core margin if you strip out the you get the drags in the ppp but just kind of the core nim ex the ppp i guess how are you thinking about that the next couple of quarters i know you mentioned the sub debt and some other items and the cost of funds moving modestly lower just a little bit slower down downdraft here harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc were just i we dont see it going up were going to try to keep it flat i dont have as much room on deposit costs to pick up any kind of additional increase in margins from that so it will all depend on how well we do on loan pricing over the next couple of quarters brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got you okay perfect i appreciate the color and nice quarter guys harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript
