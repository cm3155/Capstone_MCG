management discussion section operator good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to jpmorgan chases second quarter earnings call this call is being recorded your line will be muted for the duration of the call we will now go live to the presentation please stand by at this time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator good morning everyone the presentation is available on our website and please refer to the disclaimer in the back starting on page the firm reported net income of billion eps of on revenue of billion and delivered an rotce of touching on a few highlights we had another quarter of strong performance in markets which generated revenue of nearly billion credit is still quite healthy and net chargeoffs remain historically low and there continue to be positive trends in loan growth across our businesses with average loans up yearonyear and quarteronquarter on page we have some more detail revenue of billion was up million or yearonyear nii ex markets was up billion or driven by higher rates and balance sheet growth nir ex markets was down billion or largely driven by lower ib fees and higher card acquisition costs and markets revenue was up billion or yearonyear expenses of billion were up billion or yearonyear predominantly on higher investments and structural expenses partially offset by lower volume and revenuerelated expenses and credit costs were billion which included net chargeoffs of million and reserve builds of million reflecting loan growth as well as a modest deterioration in the economic outlook on to balance sheet and capital on page lets start by talking about our plans for capital management over the coming quarters the new scb will raise our standardized cet1 requirement to effective in the fourth quarter and the gsib effective in further raises this requirement to at investor day we said that we expected scb to be higher and made it clear that in the nearterm share buybacks would be significantly reduced in order to build capital for the increased requirements in light of the scb coming in even higher than expected we have paused buybacks for the nearterm as we discussed at investor day and as we show at the bottom of this presentation page our organic capital generation allows us to rapidly build capital in excess of future requirements with a current target of roughly in the fourth quarter any excess over the regulatory requirements offers us protection against a range of economic scenarios with room to deploy capital in line with our strategic priorities we have a longestablished track record of balance sheet discipline across the company and this quarters rwa reduction shows evidence of this discipline jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 turning to this quarters results you can see that our cet1 ratio of is up basis points from the prior quarter our rwa was down approximately billion with growth in franchise lending being more than offset by the combination of active balance sheet management and the normalization of market risk rwa from the first quarter cet1 capital was slightly down as earnings were offset by distributions and the impact of aoci drawdowns in our afs portfolio now lets go to our businesses starting with consumer community banking on page before i review ccbs performance let me touch on what were seeing in our data regarding the health of the us consumer spend is still healthy with combined debit and credit spend up yearonyear we see the impact of inflation and higher nondiscretionary spend across income segments notably the average consumer is spending more yearon year on gas and approximately more on recurring bills and other nondiscretionary categories at the same time we have yet to observe a pullback in discretionary spending including in the lower income segments with travel and dining growing a robust yearonyear overall and with spending growing faster than incomes median deposit balances are down across income segments for the first time since the pandemic started though cash buffers still remain elevated with that as a backdrop this quarter ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was down yearonyear in consumer business banking revenue was up yearonyear driven by growth in deposits deposits were up yearonyear and quarteronquarter and client investment assets were down yearonyear driven by market performance partially offset by flows home lending revenue was down yearonyear as the rate environment drove both lower production revenue and tighter spreads partially offset by higher net servicing revenue and mortgage origination volume of billion was down moving to card auto revenue was down yearonyear reflecting higher acquisition costs on strong new card account originations and lower auto lease income largely offset by higher card nii card outstandings were up and revolving balances were up and in auto originations were billion down from record levels a year ago due to continued lack of vehicle supply and rising rates while loans were up expenses of billion were up yearonyear driven by higher investments of structural expenses partially offset by lower volume and revenuerelated expenses in terms of actual credit performance this quarter credit costs were million reflecting net chargeoffs of million down million yearonyear driven by card and a reserve build of million in card driven by loan growth next the cib on page cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion there were a number of notable items this quarter including net markdowns on certain equity investments of approximately million with about million reflected in payments and markdowns on the bridge book of approximately million in ib revenue investment banking revenue of billion was down yearonyear or down excluding the bridge book markdowns ib fees were down versus an alltime record quarter last year we maintained our numberone rank with a yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were down reflecting a decline in announced activity which started in the first quarter the volatile market resulted in muted issuance in our underwriting businesses underwriting fees were down for debt and down for equity jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 in terms of outlook while our existing pipeline remains healthy conversion of the deal backlog may be challenging if the current headwinds continue lending revenue of million was up versus the prior year driven by gains on marktomarket hedges as well as higher loan balances moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear in both fixed income and equities against a strong quarter last year in fixed income elevated volatility drove both increased client flows and robust trading results in the macro franchise most notably in currencies and emerging markets this was partially offset by credit and securitized products in a challenging spread environment in equity markets we had a strong second quarter and again increased volatility produced a strong performance in derivatives credit adjustments and other was a loss of million largely driven by funding spread widening payments revenue was billion up yearonyear or up excluding the markdowns on equity investments the yearonyear growth was primarily driven by higher rates securities services revenue of billion was up yearonyear with growth in fees and higher rates more than offsetting the impact of lower market levels expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher structural expenses and investments largely offset by lower revenuerelated compensation moving to commercial banking on page commercial banking reported net income of billion revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by higher deposit margins partially offset by lower investment banking revenue gross investment banking revenue of million was down driven by lower debt and equity underwriting activity expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher structural and volume and revenuerelated expenses deposits were down quarteronquarter driven by migration of nonoperating deposits into higher yielding alternatives which we expect to continue given the current rate environment loans were up sequentially ci loans were up reflecting higher revolver utilization and originations across middle market and corporate client banking cre loans were up driven by strong loan originations and funding in commercial term lending and real estate banking finally credit costs of million were largely driven by loan growth while net chargeoffs remain historically low and then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of for the quarter revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by growth in deposits and loans as well as higher margins partially offset by investment valuation losses versus gains in the prior year in addition reductions in management fees linked to this years market declines have been almost entirely offset by the removal of most money market fund fee waivers expenses of billion were up yearonyear largely driven by investments in our private banking advisory teams technology and asset management as well as higher volume and revenuerelated expenses for the quarter net longterm inflows of billion were driven by equities aum of trillion and overall client assets of trillion down and yearonyear respectively were predominantly driven by lower market levels partially offset by net longterm inflows and finally loans were up quarteronquarter while deposits were down sequentially driven by seasonal client tax payments turning to corporate on page corporate reported a net loss of million revenue was million versus a loss in the prior year nii was million up billion predominantly due to the impact of higher rates and expenses of million were lower by million yearonyear jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 next the outlook on page you will recall that at investor day we expected nii ex markets for to be in excess of billion we now expect it to be in excess of billion reflecting fed funds reaching by year end we still expect adjusted expense to be approximately billion and the card net chargeoff rate to be less than for so to wrap up the companys performance was strong again this quarter in what was a complex operating environment as we look forward we are mindful of the elevated uncertainty in the global economy but we feel confident that we are prepared and wellpositioned for a broad range of outcomes with that operator please open up the line for qa question and answer section operator please stand by and the first question is coming from steve chubak from wolfe research please proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning jeremy hey good morning jamie wanted to start off with a question on capital targets i dont believe you provided an update on your firm wide cet1 target of to and given the new higher scb future increases in your gsib surcharge to your regulatory minimum is slated to increase beyond by which is also beyond the horizon reflected on slide and just given that high regulatory minimum elevated scb volatility in recent years what do you believe is an appropriate capital target for you to manage to from here over the long term jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah steve good question so obviously youre right in the sense that we didnt talk about on the slide and as you note we have two gsib bucket increases coming one in the first quarter of and the other one in the first quarter of so we had worked all that out at investor day and talked about to target which implies sort of a modest buffer to be used flexibly based on what we expected would be some increase in scb obviously the increase came in a bit higher than expected so for now were really focused on of course all else equal you would assume that that to for would be a little bit higher but there is another round of scb and thats a long way away and as you know and as you can see theres a lot of organic capital generation so well kind of cross that bridge when we come to it jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we intend to drive that scb down by reducing the things that created it steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough and just for my follow up on the loan growth outlook loan growth continues to surprise positively certainly the tone jeremy that you conveyed was quite constructive despite the challenging macro backdrop but with companies citing higher inventory levels declining personal savings rates growing inflationary jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 pressures whole list of potential headwinds that could negatively impact loan growth from here i was hoping you could just speak to the outlook for loan growth across some of the different businesses and what do you see as a sustainable run rate of loan growth over the medium term jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so weve talked as you know steve about sort of a midtohighsingledigits loan growth expectation for this year and that outlook is more or less still in place obviously we only have half the year left we continue to see quite robust ci growth both higher revolver utilization and new account origination were also seeing good growth in cre and of course we continue to see very robust card loan growth which is nice to see outlook beyond this year im not going to give now and obviously as you note its going to be pretty much a function of the economic environment so jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah the only thing i would like to add is that certain loan growth is discretionary and portfoliobased think of mortgages and theres a good chance were going to drive it down substantially steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough thanks so much for taking my questions jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks steve operator the next question is coming from glenn schorr from evercore isi please proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much i wonder if you could just talk to how you balance it all meaning jpmorgan is always growthminded you underwrite for returns over the cycle i get that but given some of the potential bad stuff going on in the world that youve noted in some of the articles youve been in and at the conference is there any point where that rougher outlook has you tightening the underwriting box to build capital and liquidity faster or do you think you can get there just through what youve laid out today on the buyback pause jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah no so i mean look i think all of these things are true at the same time right so first of all as you can see on page the organic capital generation enables us to build very quickly to get to where we need to be with a nice appropriate buffer on time if not early at the same time as jamie has noted obviously in this moment were going to scrutinize even more aggressively than we always do elements of our lending which are either low returning or have a low client nexus or both we do that all the time anyway but of course in this moment were going to turn up the heat on that a little bit jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 in terms of underwriting as you say we do underwrite through the cycle i think we feel comfortable with our risk appetite and our credit box and i dont think we expect any particular change there jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean the only thing i would add is that certain obviously risks that we take kind of price themselves so if you look at our bridge book its smaller than it was because we priced ourself out of the market and that was a good thing because a lot of people will lose a lot of money there and we lost a little so we are very conscious of that kind of thing all the time glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi well i appreciate that and did you all consider a cecl reserve and increasing the probability to the core scenario in this quarter and just curious on how you thought about that thanks jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes but we didnt do it and obviously what we do in the future quarters will remain to be seen jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and glenn just remember that we did do that last quarter right so we already introduced a sort of skew to the outlook beyond whats implied by the market to reflect our own slightly more negative view and in a sense arguably we were sort of early on that so it really wasnt necessary this quarter glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right thank you both operator the next question is coming from john mcdonald from autonomous research please proceed john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research hi good morning jeremy just wondering if you could talk about the deposit trends youre seeing the differences between commercial deposits wealth management and retail in terms of flows and repricing pressures jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah great question john and i think youre right to break it down by the different segments because we are seeing different dynamics there so on the wholesale side you do see some lower deposits some deposit attrition and that is entirely expected and part of the plan in the sense that for client reasons we had slightly higher appetite especially in parts of the commercial bank for nonoperating deposits knowing fully that our pricing strategy as rates went up was going to be not pay off and therefore we expected the attrition from that client base and so were seeing that and thats actually something that we want all else equal and is playing out in line with expectations jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 you do see a little bit of a decline or a little bit of a headwind in wealth management i think thats just seasonal tax payments being a little bit higher than usual and then on the consumer side were really not seeing much at all so that remains strong were not seeing any attrition there and its early in the cycle to really be observing much one way or the other from a pricing perspective john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay and then as a follow up in terms of the updated nii outlook you had talked about an exit rate in the fourth quarter of about billion at investor day just kind of wondering what that looks like and what kind of fading benefit from rate hikes you have assumed in your outlook jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so the billion number if you want kind of to put a number in you can use something like billion billion plus something like that obviously were annualizing one quarter so there can always be noise in there but that seems like a good number to us thats consistent with the increase for the full year and sorry john can you repeat your other question jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research just deposit betas yeah jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah yeah yeah so in terms of we had talked at investor day about how we saw upside into from that fourth quarter run rate and that more or less remains true there is some upside obviously were starting from a higher launch point higher rates and less so after the cpi trend but there have been moments where there were cuts in the fed expectations so that could have some impact on the dynamic obviously this is all in an environment of very volatile implieds but the core view of some upside from that fourth quarter run rate into is still in place john e mcdonald q analyst autonomous research got it thank you operator the next question is coming from betsy graseck from morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc jamie you mentioned just on the scb earlier that you intended to reduce it by reducing the things that caused it to rise could you give us a sense as to what you saw in the results that you got that drove that scb up because i talk to folks that say its a black box so it would be helpful to understand what you see as what the drivers were to that scb increase jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co well first of all its public so you can actually go see what drives it the global market shock and credit losses stuff like that and we dont agree with the stress test its inconsistent its not transparent its too volatile its basically capricious arbitrary we do a week this is one and i need to drive capital up and down by basis points so well work on it we havent made definitive decisions but ive already mentioned about we dramatically reduced rwa this quarter we may do that again next quarter were probably going to drive down mortgages and well probably drive down other credit too that creates scb so were not going to go into specifics on that its easy for us to do youve seen us do it before were going to drive down nonoperating deposits it creates no risk to us but as the gsib and various things and so were going to manage the balance sheet get good returns have great clients and im not worried about it we just want to get there right away i dont want to sit there and dawdle thats the rule they gave it to us were going betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co betsy maybe ill just jump in hey betsy maybe ill just jump in a little bit on the black box jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but another very important point for shareholders that number when they that doesnt even remotely the stress loss doesnt even remotely represent what would happen under that kind of scenario and im not saying the fed says it should or shouldnt but i would tell you wed make money under that scenario we wouldnt lose i think they had us losing billion theres almost no chance that that would be true jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 and i just so i and i feel bad for the shareholders because people look at that and say well whats going to happen i mean but theres good evidence we didnt lose money after lehman we didnt lose money in the great what just happened we didnt lose money in great financial recession the companys got huge underlying earnings power and consistent revenues in ccb asset management custody payment services and then we have some kind of fairly volatile streams and now weve got the cecl which obviously can go up or down quite a bit but again thats an accounting entry and so we feel were in very good shape we just have to hold a higher number now and were going to go there jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and betsy maybe ill just comment briefly on the black box point because as jamie noted the scb is quite volatile and i think you see that across the industry and we feel very good about building quickly enough to meet the higher requirements but theyre pretty big changes thats come into effect fairly quickly for banks and i think thats probably not healthy and the amount of transparency there is a lot of information released as jamie says but since the scb is really a quantity that gets measured to the peak drawdown period and that information does not get released it winds up being really very hard at any given moment to understand whats actually driving it and that combination of suboptimal transparency and high volatility is really our central criticism i guess i would say but nonetheless the organic capital generation jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the other thing is its got bad effects for the economy because were i just said were going to drive down this and drive down its not good for the united states economy and the mortgage business in particular is bad for lower income mortgages which hurts lower income minorities and stuff like that because we havent fixed the mortgage business and now were making it worse theres no real risk in it not a benefit to jpmorgan but it hurts this country and its very unfortunate betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc no i hear you on all that and the mortgage comment you made earlier was about shrinking mortgage growth rates or shrinking the balances of mortgages that you have on the book jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the balance well no well originate but the balances in the books will probably come down and look we reserve the right to change that but thats a portfolio decision and if it doesnt make sense to own mortgages were not going to own them betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah and would you reduce the buffer i mean in the past jamie youve talked about hey as these required capital ratios increase relative to the risk in your business staying more consistent then youve said before that you may operate with less of a buffer could you unpack that a little bit jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co were going to keep a buffer im not even sure what the scb means at this point were not going to go below any regulatory minimum and if we have to well just drive down credit more to create what weve got to create its a terrible way to run a financial system and we owe you more on what we think that buffer should be because we have so much what i think is so much excess capital it just causes huge confusion about what you should be doing with your capital but just keep in mind one thing were earning tangible equity we can continue doing that the company is in great shape were going to serve our clients and manage the hell out the rest of this stuff we still think we have great businesses and stuff like that and thats what were going to do most of this stuff doesnt create any additional risk at all it just creates capital ph need betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you operator the next question is coming from jim mitchell from seaport global securities please proceed james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities hey good morning maybe just on expenses if i kind of look at the first half with this slowdown in investment banking i think your annualized less than billion but youre still targeting billion is that implication of just higher investment spend in the second half or just uncertainty around getting the pipeline completed or not and just assuming it might get done until we know better jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jim good question weve looked at that too its definitely more the former than the latter in other words billion is the number that we see right now and the number that we believe and we can see in our outlook a bunch of factors driving up second half expense including deal ma closing and adding to the runrate as well as continued execution of our investment plans resulting in increased head count probably at a faster pace as we kind of have ramped up our hiring capacity and so on so i wouldnt draw any conclusions about lower than billion based on the first half numbers james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities okay great and then just maybe on credit it continues to look i guess very good whether its on the consumer side or commercial side we dont really see it but are you starting to see any initial cracks in credit or strains in the system jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co look i think the short answer to that question is no certainly not in any of our reported actual results for this quarter the place that everyone jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co in fact theyre excellent jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right exactly obviously running still well below normal levels from the prepandemic period but if you really want to kind of turn up the magnification on the microscope and look really really really closely if you look at cash buffers in the lower income segments and early delinquency roll rates in those segments you can maybe see a little bit of an early warning signal to the effect that the burndown of excess cash is a little bit faster there buffers are still above what they were prepandemic but coming down and that absolute numbers for the typical customer are not that high and you do see those early delinquency buckets still below prepandemic levels but getting closer in the lower income segment so if you wanted to try to look for early warning signals thats where you would see it but i think theres really still a big question about whether thats simply normalization or whether its actually an early warning sign of deterioration and for us as you know our portfolio is really not very exposed to that segment of the market so not really very significant for us james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities right so prime is still holding up quite well thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yes jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co looking better operator the next question is coming from ken usdin from jefferies please proceed ken usdin q analyst jefferies company yeah hey guys good morning just a followup on the points about managing the balance sheet and capital and rwas how do you think about your ability to manage that rwa output and dimensionalizing how if at all it might impact either the net income outcome or the rotce outcome as you look forward jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co just very roughly we have a tremendous ability to manage it and i can think we do it without affecting our rotce targets and stuff like that obviously itll affect nii a little bit and capital generation a little bit and stuff like that but all told were going to manage the hell out of it and well be fine jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it okay thats a fair point and then just second one on cards card revenue rate continues to slip even with the nii benefit obviously youve got the denominator increase in there too and spend versus lend can you just help us understand the dynamics underneath card revenue rate and where you expect it to go from here thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so on card revenue rate wed said that we thought was a reasonable number for the full year and its running a little bit lower right now and i think the current level look what is it mikael or something is probably the right number for the full year at this point and really the difference is driven by a couple factors the main one is that while the growth and revolve is basically still in place our view that we would see normalization revolve balances happening towards early beginning of next year that starting point of that did get slightly delayed by omicron by about six weeks and so that all else equal is a little bit of a nii headwind relative to what wed expected but still obviously very robust jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just add a little bit on because i know im harping on mortgage a little bit here but i just want to explain it because if you go to europe okay the capital held against mortgages is like a fifth of what we have to hold here and we can obviously manage that and standardized risk weighted assets do not represent returns or risk so there are a lot of ways to manage it and theres no securitization market today so our view would change if theres a securitization market we might do something different but by not owning it buying it selling it hedging it swapping it there are a million ways to manage it without really affecting a lot of your risk and returns and so its unfortunate because i think this is all kind of a waste of time in terms of serving our client our job is to serve clients through thick or thin good or bad with what they need and how they need it and now we spend all our time talking about these ridiculous regulatory requirements jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right so yeah and just to finish on card so slightly lower nii just from the omicron delay and that slightly better thanexpected new client acquisition is a driver there and then there are some subtle kind of funding effects from the higher rate environment contributing to it as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay thanks a lot operator the next question is coming from mike mayo from wells fargo securities please proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc could you help me reconcile your words with your actions after investor day jamie you said a hurricane is on the horizon but today youre holding firm with your billion expense guidance for i mean its like youre acting like theres sunny skies ahead youre out buying kayaks surfboards wave runners just before the storm so is it tough times or not jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co no let me first of all we run the company weve always run the company consistently investing doing stuff through storms we dont like pull in and pull out and go up and go down and go into markets and out of markets through storms we manage the company and youve seen us do this consistently since ive been at bank one we invest we grow we expand we manage through the storm and stuff like that and so i had mentioned i dont know if you were on the media call but there are very good current numbers taking place consumers are in good shape theyre spending money they have more income jobs are plentiful theyre spending more than last year almost plus more than precovid businesses you talk to them theyre in good shape they are doing fine weve never seen business credit be better ever like in our lifetimes and thats the current environment the future environment which is not that far off involves rates going up maybe more than people think because of inflation maybe stagflation maybe a soft there might be a soft landing im simply saying theres a range of potential outcomes from a soft landing to a hard landing driven by how much rates go up the effect of quantitative tightening the effect of volatile markets and obviously this terrible humanitarian crisis in ukraine and the war and then the effect of that on food and oil and gas and were simply pointing out those things make the probabilities and possibilities of these events different its not going to change how we run the company the economy will be bigger in years were going to run the company were going to serve more clients were going to open our branches were going to invest in the things and well manage through that if you look at what we do our bridge book is way down that was managing certain exposures were not in subprime fundamentally thats managing your exposures were quite careful about how we run the risk of the company and if there was a reason to cut back on something we would but not only we think its a great business thats got great growth prospects its just going to go through a storm and in fact going through a storm we will that gives us opportunities too i always remind myself the economy will be a lot bigger in years were here to serve clients through thick or thin and we will do that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so clearly running the company for next to years if we have a recession in the next to months how does technology help you manage through that better whether its credit losses managing for less credit losses expenses more flexibility or revenues maybe gaining market share whats the benefit of all these technology investments if we have a recession over the next jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think we gave you some examples at investor day for example ai which we spend a lot of money on we gave you a couple examples but one of them is we spent million building certain risk and fraud systems so that when we process payments on the consumer side losses are down million or million with volumes way up thats a huge benefit i dont think youd want us to stop doing that because theres a recession and so plus in a recession certain things get cheaper branches are enormously profitable banks are enormously profitable and were going to keep on doing those things and weve managed through recessions before well manage it again and im quite comfortable well do it quite well mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co but stopstarting on recruiting or training or technology or branch right thats crazy we dont do that and weve never done that we didnt do it in and and put us in quite good stead in terms yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah i think the only other thing is just market revenues are a lot weaker right i mean the market outlook is worse and so we know you had structural spending so when all else equal thatd be a little bit less then jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yes thats very performancebased too and again mike the way i look at it a little bit in years the global gdp or years the global gdp global financial assets global companies companies over billion will all double thats what were building for were not building for like months mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thank you operator the next question is coming from gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets please proceed gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning guys jeremy you touched on the deposit commentary a short while ago can you elaborate on qt and the impact that youve seen now granted i know june was not full qt of billion a month but can you guys give us a flavor and i think jamie you mentioned that if i heard it correctly that maybe billion to billion of deposits could outflow over time im assuming due to qt but can you guys elaborate what you saw in june is it tracking the way you think its going to be and any further outlook for what the deposits could be over the next months due to qt jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah hey gerard so as you know qt just started so i think its not the sort of thing where you can say i expect this exact outcome and then sort of track it sectorbysector because you can see the clear impact on system wide deposits but that also interacts with rrp and tga and stuff like that and so how that flows into the banking system and then into any individual bank across the wholesale and consumer segments is kind of a tricky thing so its early on that but at a high level and your comments about what jamie said before are right the story remains true which is that depending on how qt interacts with rrp and loan growth in particular you could see some decline in deposits in the banking system and we would see our share of that but we would expect that to primarily come out of wholesale and primarily come out of the nonoperating and sort of less valuable portions of our deposit base while in consumer while you could in theory have a little bit of a headwind there we feel pretty good about our ability to keep those levels pretty steady based on the strength of the franchise and the ability to take share gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a follow up i dont believe you guys disclosed the outstandings in the bridge book but two questions and jamie youve been very clear about this in the last years how youve derisked that balance sheet and you mentioned that already today can you just give us some color on how different it is today from just so investors know that it is meaningfully different and second what caused the writedown in the bridge book this quarter jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so if you go back to i think the whole street bridge book was billion i think the whole street bridge book today is billion or under billion jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its like jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co our percent of that bridge brook has come down substantially just in the last months and thats really just underwriting loan by loan by loan and you win some and you lose some and if you guys look at high yield spreads and stuff like that bonds were down thats what you see so you have some flex and were big boys we know that and there is writedowns on a couple of bridge loans theyre not huge i think they were in the investment banking line jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its in the ib revenue line and theres a small amount in the commercial bank as well but as you said jamie and as daniel also mentioned at investor day i think we made conscious choices here to dial back our risk appetite here and accepted some share losses in leveraged finance so we feel good about where we are jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 were still open for business for the right deals at the right risk appetite on the right term absolutely but weve been careful gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good thank you operator the next question is coming from erika najarian from ubs please proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi just had a few followup questions the first is on balance sheet management jeremy the illustrative path that you set forth on slide does that include rwa mitigation and as we think about the billionplus in updated nii guide what kind of deposit growth does that assume you noted that part of the scb mitigation is to drive out nonoperating deposits just wanted to understand what the assumption was there as well please jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah hey erika sure so first point you have to turn off sic on your magnifying glass but if you look at footnote on page you can see that right at the end of there it says assumes flat rwa in the projection and i think within that who knows what the exact mix will be and youve heard jamies comments on that but if you look at the table above you see that youve got the usual moving parts weve got organic loan growth that we want thats profitable on its own or in part of important relationships that wed like to see continue to happen some of it is a little bit passive we cant really control it it moves up and down as a function of factors like var and then theres the mitigation piece of it which were going to turn up the scrutiny quite intensely as i said before on lower returning lower client nexus or both so across those three bits well see how it goes but as jamie said we feel pretty confident here in terms of deposits at this point deposit growth is probably less of a driver overall looking forward of the nii outlook our deposit outlook remains more or less the same that i said before and that weve talked about at investor day which is we do expect to see some attrition in wholesale we expect consumer to be relatively stable and well see how it goes erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my follow up question is for jamie jamie weve heard your caution about the economy and i think theres a bigger debate on how the us consumer is going to be impacted in light or in context of a downturn the statistics that jeremy laid out imply a pretty healthy starting point for the consumer that you bank and the reserve build for loan growth in card and the less than loss rate in card lead us to believe that your consumer is still okay as you think about the various scenarios and you think about the realistic range of outcomes how does the us consumer perform because it feels like thats the big wild card and weve seen the journal term a jobful recession i just wanted to get your thoughts there jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so first i just want to point out that on that chart thats not a forecast what its going to be at the end of the quarter so were going to if youre going to pencil some of your models its on december and it will probably be at the end of the first quarter and because obviously we use capital for a whole bunch of different reasons and the consumer i feel like a broken record the consumer right now is in great shape so even if we go into a recession theyre entering that recession with less leverage in far better shape than they did in and and far better shape than they did even in and jobs are plentiful now of course jobs may disappear things happen but theyre in very good shape and obviously when you have recessions it affects consumer income and consumer credit our credit card portfolio is prime i mean its exceptional but again were adults in that we know that if you have a recession loss it will go up we prepare for all that and were prepared to take it because we grow the business over time were not going to just immediately run out of it and so i think its great the consumers in good shape and its excellent that i like the fact that wages are going up for people on the low end i like the fact that jobs are plentiful i think thats good for the average american and we should applaud that and so theyre in good shape right now erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thanks for that operator the next question is coming from matt oconnor from deutsche bank please proceed jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co matt i dont know operator the next question jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co if youre on yeah operator yeah the next question is coming from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america merrill lynch please proceed ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning i guess just a couple of followups jeremy in terms of the markets have gone very quickly from pricing in a ton of rate hikes to potentially pricing in rate cuts next year just talk to us like how thats informing your alco balance sheet management as you think about hedging downside risk from lower rates start to months out like should we expect you to add duration or do anything synthetic to protect against lower rates jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 were going to keep that to ourselves jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah yeah but i dont know maybe if you want a little bit of a general color about how were thinking about the portfolio i do think jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co go ahead jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah okay ill keep it brief on duration i think at this level of rates also with very quickly cash yields being roughly not that different from 10year yields the question of duration adding or not is just generally less important for us then the other piece of it is whether theres the opportunity to deploy cash into nonhqla securities broadly into spread product and obviously spread product is more attractive right now but as weve been talking about a lot on this call the priority right now is to build capital so thatll be something for later i would say jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and i should just point out the forward curve has been consistently wrong in my whole lifetime so we dont necessarily make investments based on the forward curve and second weve always told you that we use the portfolio and other things to manage the broad range of outcomes not just to try to add nii so if you said add nii next quarter yeah we could do that but that wouldnt be managing the broad outcome of potential outcomes here which is to protect the company through all possible outcomes ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thats helpful and just one follow up on credit i heard your comments on the consumer if we enter some version of a mild recession like if you had to pick one or two areas where do you think losses would be driven by is it on the commercial side is it cre how do you expect that downturn to kind of play out jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think at investor day you had a chart that showed through the cycle losses jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so i mean i would just go back to that and we showed what we think throughthecycle losses would be for credit cards ci and a bunch of other things and obviously throughthecycle is an average and you could kind of double that okay jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and that showed exceptionally low losses in wholesale so im not sure whether or not thats a prediction of the future or not but yeah ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch got it thank you operator and the next question is coming from matt oconnor from deutsche bank please proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi sorry about that i somehow got disconnected sorry if i missed this but if we think about provisioning or reserving for a moderate recession whats the best guess on how much that might be i think for covid it was around billion ex cecl but obviously you alluded to the consumer being better and the loan mix has changed theres lots of puts and takes but how would you frame kind of total reserve builds jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co let me say it very simply for you in covid we got to unemployment within three months and in two quarters we added billion which we can easily handle that is clearly i always put that almost out as the worst case itll clearly be a lot less than that and you guys could look at the things yourselves every is another million or something like that if you change odds and so on jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah i mean we think the current reserve the current allowance we think is conservatively appropriate for a range of scenarios and as you know its already kind of skewed to the downside and there are probably some other elements of slight conservatism in there so well see how it goes but we feel that its appropriate and conservative at this point matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then separately youve got about billion of losses in oci obviously most of that flows back to capital as the bonds mature whats kind of some good rule of thumb in terms of how quickly that comes back if rates stabilize here jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co basis points a year of cet1 yeah matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc all right basis points you said jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co basis points of cet1 a year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it okay thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co after tax jamie dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co basically five years it kind of bleeds back in over five years jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i mean assume its weighted average life of four or five years yeah so the good rule of thumb on constant rates is about basis points of cet1 accretion a year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thank you operator at the moment there are no further questions in the queue jamie dimon chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co okay folks everybody thank you very much and well be talking to you in a quarter operator thank you everyone that concludes your conference call for today you may now disconnect thank you all
