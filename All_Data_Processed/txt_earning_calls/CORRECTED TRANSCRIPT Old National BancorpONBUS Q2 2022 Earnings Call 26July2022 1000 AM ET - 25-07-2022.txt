earnings per share was slide shows the trend in total loan growth on a historical combined basis excluding ppp loans q2 represents our eighth consecutive quarter of organic loan growth with total loans increasing on an annualized basis driven by robust commercial growth of and consumer growth of growth within consumer loans was driven by residential mortgage which reflects lower saleable production and is net of a transactional book runoff of million the balance of the transactional book at quarter end was approximately billion old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 the investment portfolio decreased modestly by approximately million quarteroverquarter with the overall mix remaining largely unchanged and i note we have deployed a significant portion of the cash outstanding at the end of the last quarter in support of loan growth investment for portfolio yields improved significantly to with new money yields of effective duration was stable despite the dramatic shift in the yield curve with new money purchases focused on the shorter end in addition we transferred another billion of securities into our htm portfolio to help mitigate future oci impact slide provide further details of our commercial loans and pipeline the strong second quarter growth was well distributed with annualized growth in ci and annualized growth in cre we were also pleased that despite the strong second quarter production our pipeline ended the quarter at a record billion which is a increase over q1 turning briefly to pricing new money yields on ci increased basis points from q1 to with new cre production yields up basis points to slide shows details of our q2 commercial production by product end market the billion of production was well balanced across all product lines and major markets the chicago market continued its strong momentum with nearly billion of production but all of our legacy and expansion markets had strong quarters as well in addition all of our product lines posted quarteroverquarter loan growth a clear reflection of the strong loan demand throughout our footprint moving to slide endofperiod deposits were stable quarteroverquarter although we did see some deployment of deposits in our commercial and retail clients that was largely offset by seasonal increases in municipal and government funds total cost of deposits continues to be low at basis points up just basis point from the prior quarter we are prepared to defend deposits through rate actions if necessary but we have ample funding forces and active liquidity to support future commercial loan growth next on slide you will see details of our net interest income and margins both improved meaningfully due to strong loan growth improved earnings asset mix and higher interest rates nim expanded basis points quarter overquarter to core margin excluding accretion and ppp income increased basis points to slide provides additional details on our asset liability position and projected margin range margin is expected to continue to expand meaningfully over the next few quarters albeit at a slower pace the assumptions in our outlook including fed funds target rate of at year end a static balance sheet and deposit betas that increased from today to a december cycletodate beta in the range of to we believe we have opportunities to outperform this outlook through continued strong loan growth remixing of earning assets and a longer deposit pricing lag also while we remain wellpositioned for rising rates we have been proactively hedging the balance sheet over the last several quarters to protect our margin from the possibility of a hard economic landing and quick reversal in fed policy we currently have over billion in down rate protection including floors and collars which we will continue to build over the remainder of the year slide shows trends in adjusted noninterest income which was million for the quarter slightly better than expected due to million of discrete items related to equity investment returns and recovery from fully charged off acquired loans that we dont expect to recur mortgage production was higher than anticipated however normalizing gain on sale margins and a higher percentage of portfolio production did negatively impact the indiscernible old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 next slide shows the trend in adjusted noninterest expenses adjusting for merger charges and tax credit amortization noninterest expense was million and our adjusted efficiency ratio was expenses were slightly higher than anticipated due to a yeartodate trueup of incentive accruals to reflect betterthanplanned performance we continue to run slightly ahead of our planned cost synergies but expect the bulk of the savings to begin late third quarter merger charges are also tracking in line with our diligence estimates with approximately million remaining slide provides further details on our path to achieving the cost savings of million with the system conversion now behind us we have completed the last major milestone required prior to realizing the remaining cost saves expectations on timing are unchanged with of the cost synergies on an annualized basis realized in the fourth quarter and the remainder to come early in note our run rate was updated to include higher incentive related expenses resulting from better than planned performance slide shows our credit trends of both historical old national and first midwest credit conditions continue to be benign and our commercial and consumer portfolios continue to perform exceptionally well we ended q2 with positive trends and betterthanpeer results in all key credit metrics net chargeoffs were a modest basis points on slide you will see the details of our first quarter allowance which stands at million up from million at the end of q1 reserve build was driven by strong loan growth and a more pessimistic economic forecast partly offset by lower specific reserves and improved asset quality in our commercial book the financial health of our clients remains strong and while we are not seeing any signs of credit deterioration in our portfolio today we believe it is prudent to maintain elevated levels of qualitative reserves until the cloud of economic uncertainty lifts in addition to the million in total reserves we also carry million in credit marks slide provides details on our capital position at quarter end as you can see it remains strong with a cet1 ratio of the modest 14basis point quarterly decrease reflects robust loan growth which more than offset our strong retained earnings we continue to monitor our balance sheet for economic stress and feel very comfortable with our capital levels as i wrap up my comments here are some key takeaways we couldnt have scripted a better result in the first full quarter following the closing of our partnership client and our retention has been exceptional leading to another quarter of broadbased positive loan growth led by our chicago market rate increases brought welcome margin expansion that was meaningfully higher than our peers we recently completed the major systems conversion off schedule credit conditions remain benign and we are tracking ahead of our planned cost synergies slide includes thoughts on our outlook for the remainder of we ended the quarter with a record commercial pipeline which supports our favorable outlook on loan growth albeit at a potentially slower pace in q2 given waning consumer and business sentiment net interest income and margins should benefit from continued loan growth and fed rate increases consistent with the margin guidance we outlined earlier we expect our fee businesses to continue to perform well despite headwinds we expect solid organic growth in our wealth business but aum will continue to be under pressure from market fluctuations in both equities and fixed income mortgages following industry patterns with fee revenue under pressure from normalizing gain on sale margins as well as a higher percentage of portfolio production commercial activity should support continued strong capital markets revenues and lastly we anticipate pressure on deposit service charges consistent with industry trends we are targeting adjusted q4 expenses of million and old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 technical difficulty operator ladies and gentlemen please remain holding we have lost connection with the speaker line and we are reconnecting again please remain holding technical difficulty operator ladies and gentlemen we do have the speaker line back on please proceed with the presentation brendon b falconer chief financial officer old national bancorp thank you we are targeting adjusted q4 expenses of million and expect to realize the majority of cost synergies by yearend credit conditions are benign but we will continue to take a conservative approach to reserves in the near term lastly a brief update on taxes we are expecting approximately million of tax credit amortization for the remainder of the year with the corresponding full year expected tax rate of approximately on a core fte basis and on a gaap basis in closing we believe we have strong earnings catalysts that should differentiate us from our peers as we finish the year ahead into while the equity markets have us discounted relative to our peers we believe this delta should narrow as we continue to deliver commercial loan growth execute on the promise cost synergies maintain our customary credit discipline and leverage our bestinclass deposit franchise for better than pure margin expansion with those comments id like to open the call for your questions and we do have a full team available including mark sander jim sandgren and john moran old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler scott your line is now open r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thanks for taking james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning scott yeah absolutely good to hear from you sorry about the challenge with the line this morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co likewise no problem i have to say brendon picked it back up without missing a beat that was very impressive james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp well there was a lot of drastic indiscernible movement in the room as you can imagine but glad were able to complete the call and i appreciate you coming back to your rightful spot as number one on the question list so good job r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you for that no i appreciate that i wanted to ask just couple of questions so when you talk about the loan growth outlook potentially slowing i guess i sort of meant that to mean just because the was just so extraordinarily strong and you noted in the written comments in the outlook client sentiment in there i was just hoping you could expand on that comment what your customers are seeing and saying to you guys james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah ill give you a highlevel view and let maybe mark or jim jump in here you know just like everybody else i think were cautiously optimistic that we will continue to close the pipeline but we cant take into account the declining sentiment somewhat higher interest rates all those things are kind of weighing on our mind but we still feel really good about our pipeline the fact that it grew to record levels still feels very good and our clients are innovative and they find ways to still get their deals done but we are also just cautious like everybody else would you like to add mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 well i would add as you alluded to we had a really strong second quarter so expecting million every quarter perhaps might be a bit much but the pipeline would indicate and our clients our commercial clients revenues and profitability would indicate that things are still quite strong out there and we grew the pipeline even as we had a great second quarter so in the nearterm i would say we feel good about our outlook for loan growth but again perhaps not at million level this quarter we also got boosted a little bit by ph line draws line draws picked up a couple hundred million of that r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay wonderful thank you and then if i can switch over to the funding side for a second virtually no increase in deposit costs which is great and appreciate the data commentary in the deck just curious what you guys are thinking for deposit betas once the fed stops raising rates in other words sort of the full through the cycle beta versus the year end that you cite there and then would be curious if theres any difference in pricing pressure that you guys are seeing in the old or sort of the legacy old national footprint versus the newer chicago portion of the footprint james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah scott i think pricing pressure is picking up a little bit but not unexpectedly were starting to see it for the first time so were getting the typical costs from the more price sensitive customers and were responding accordingly in terms of what the total beta is at the end of the cycle its hard to tell at this point and we believe we have a competitive advantage with our deposit franchise and our expectation is that well be better than the average bank at the end of this right now our models are showing it through the cycle around but well see where it ends up r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect all right good thank you guys very much i appreciate it james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks scott operator thank you for your questions scott our next question comes from the line of ben gerlinger with hovde group ben your line is now open benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc hi good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning ben yeah good morning benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 it looks like i got dialed in minutes earlier anyway let me put the slide deck together deserves a round of applause i think its very very helpful just for the couple of new slides in there so kind of just answering or following up on scotts question about deposits when you guys think about the funding relative to the pricing is there any kind of pressure points that you guys are seeing i guess now you have to balance both sides of the balance sheet here but is loan pricing still more of the headache or do you starting to see a little bit more pressure on kind of the more sensitive clients that are calling a bit more frequently on the funding side james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i would say spreads on the loan side have held up quite well so were not seeing pressure there and the deposit side i guess were anticipating it coming more than seeing it right now and were going to stay competitive in our marketplaces and so yeah we wont be the first but we wont be the last kind of thing benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got you okay thats helpful and then i guess in the guidance youre assuming the fed moves ph on wednesday but on friday when you get the first q2 look on gdp and as a sneaky suspicion of being a technical recession does that change the way you guys are approaching overall growth across lending categories is there any areas that you might be kind of pressing the gas or tapping the brakes to some degree on just broadly speaking with loans james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp again ill jump in here ask the team to follow up where i maybe dont get it right but i dont believe so again its a clientbyclient situation there are some clients and some industries that maybe you think are more vulnerable that will continue to lend and then theres some industries that we may be cautious about but it really hasnt changing our outlook at all regardless of what the gdp numbers report our clients overall are very healthy whether its the personal side or the business side are overall very healthy continue to come into this very well prepared and i dont think as i talked to other banks in our marketplace and across the country i dont think our approach is that much different than what im hearing from others i think were all optimistic that well continue to have growth opportunities and i think theres still very healthy demand out there to continue to want to do business benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got it that was very fair you guys never really had much of a credit issue so it seems like we have good clients which is a big positive going into any kind of economic slowdown the last one for me i mean you have a much bigger balance sheet do you have any kind of new updated guideline indiscernible guide rails or anything like that for the loan to deposit ratio and im assuming were nowhere near the high end but is there a high end and where your comfort level would be james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp well certainly we talk about that internally here but weve got no published stated targets out there i do think we could withstand a better remix on the balance sheet you know thats been a goal of ours for quite some time is to remix our balance sheet and i think youre seeing the fruits of that labor with the strong commercial growth so old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 i dont think were anywhere near any limits you know we do multiyear forecast and look at these items on capital liquidity and feel very comfortable with where were positioned at today and kind of the trend line of growth benjamin gerlinger q analyst hovde group llc got it thats fair thats heck of a quarter ill step back james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks ben appreciate your support operator thank you for your question ben our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw chris your line is now open christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning everybody brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp good morning chris good to hear from you christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thanks thanks brendon maybe brendon ill start with you on slide great detail on the components and the outlook the one thing that sticks out is the static balance sheet assumption can you walk through given you guys have redeployed all the cash in the quarter how the core margin would the sensitivity of those metrics if you do get a dynamic balance sheet maybe not the same level of growth but a little bit of growth brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah chris i think maybe the shorthand would be wed be near the higher end of that range with some normalized ph sales loan growth over the indiscernible the remainder of the year and then better performance of deposit betas from these assumptions maybe both through that top end range but thats probably shorthand christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe on costs the million that you lay out in the fourth quarter that will assume all the cost saves or like by the end of the quarter im just trying to get a lift off point it seems like 900plus range exiting the year im just trying to get a sense for next year what level of cost inflation we should be baking in brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 yes thats of the cost saves so you have another rough and tough million to come on an annualized basis in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe if i can could sneak one in you talked about the i think new commercial and wealth relationship managers what about any attrition given how competitive the markets are for talent today anything unexpected today that you would call out james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp i dont think so we look at those attrition reports very regularly and our attrition has been running in a really close to our threeyear kind of average just more broadly speaking across the entire company and certainly well have pockets here and there but honestly weve had really strong attrition numbers but i do think we will continue to recruit talent and its not were not replacing always replacing positions we are adding talent to markets where we think we have the opportunity to continue to grow and we also have opportunities with our bigger balance sheet right and certainly some of the specialty businesses that first midwest brought to us to continue to grow and invest in those businesses and so particularly as we think about our more broader footprint so well just continue to do that but i dont see anything in the attrition numbers its mainly kind of pause and in fact as weve talked about historically our relationship managers in chicagoland market has been excellent weve had very little if any attrition in that market so we feel really good about our ability and having success helps right and i think were showing a great deal of success particularly in the legacy first midwest footprint christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great great thanks thanks and then maybe last one on the buyback you talk about just rebuild near term what are the i guess the medium term thoughts on resuming that obviously i know loan growth is one consideration brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no chris yeah we had no plans in the near or medium term to turn that back on wed like to see capital build back before we start christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thanks james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks chris operator thank you for your question chris our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens terry your line is now open old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thank you good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc you ran through some of the puts and takes to deposits in the second quarter but it was nice to see balances flat quarteroverquarter given some of what your competitors have reported could you maybe talk about your expectations for deposits in the second half of this year and then given the conversion that occurred this month any noticeable change in deposit balances over the last month brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp first ill take this ill start no noticeable change in deposit balances over the past month our expectations are along this year that deposits will probably come under pressure as people deploy liquidity that said we are out there and working on things to start growing deposits as we head into this liquidity cycle and so were prepared to defend what we have and proactively get on offense and start gathering deposits terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc and another question for you brendon again your outlook for fees you kind of started your discussion with you feel good about the momentum but then as i look at some of the items wealth mortgage service charges it implied some pressure so if you kind of normalize that other line and then think about the trends that are on slide could you be a little more precise in your fee outlook technical difficulty james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp operator did we lose the connection again operator it looks like the connection has once again been lost please standby as we reconnect them technical difficulty operator our speaker team is back on the call and terry your line is still open james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp sorry about that terry brendon will answer your question you asked old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc yeah okay thank you brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah terry i think i got the gist of it please but let me know if i missed something yes terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc definitely brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp so clearly under pressure i think weve had really strong organic growth in aum and the wealth and brokerage but equity markets the fixed income markets obviously putting pressure and youre starting to see that come through on the fee line obviously the mortgage story is the same as everybody elses in the industry but yes so that fee lines are moving under pressure but we feel really good about the organic growth in that space terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that and then one last question you added on slide your new loan production markets there was a new color versus last quarter could you just talk about where youve opened up some new lpos and what was behind that was it million of production james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp yeah hey terry this is jim sandgren so as we talked about weve been in st louis now since and have built out a nice team there weve got a market president and two corporate rms that are doing a great job we have a treasury management representative and a credit person there in st louis and theyve continued to grow both on the corporate and commercial real estate side we just recently got into kansas city earlier this year really in january and hired two great middle market rms big bank background and theyre up to a really good start so a combination of kind of middle market and cre opportunities that have helped spur the growth in those two markets terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc thanks jim nice to hear your voice and thanks everyone for the time james a sandgren a chief executive officercommercial banking old national bancorp thanks for your questions james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 thanks terry operator thanks for your question terry our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc jon your line is now open jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i was going to say jim youre supposed to have the call drop on bad quarters not good quarter james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp this is the first that ive ever been here we had three drops in a row i dont know whats going on its raining like cats and dogs out right now so i dont know if the bad weather is causing us some technical issues here but we apologize jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc its all right slide just a couple of followups brendon whats can you go into a little more detail about overall goals of the hedging strategy and are you giving anything up on the upside in pursuing this or not brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp no were trying to structure the hedging to allow us to take advantage of all the upside but actually protects from the downside so thats why the collar structure and floor structure are in place and the objective is to not be to act as an asset sensitive when the fed funds hit the top right so it slowly manages to lean back to a neutral position as we reach at the peak without making any big bets so same thing we did in the last recycle were trying to do the same thing here jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay chris mcgratty asked about under your assumptions of static balance sheet i just wanted to go one more further down the to cumulative deposit beta by year end seems a little bit high since were almost already in august and you barely see anything budge just opportunity to outperform that type of assumption of to cumulative by the end of the year brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 yeah i think theres an opportunity were starting to see some pressure that assumption was built off of looking at the last rate cycle and where the fed funds rate was when it was at million where our deposit costs were but this is happening much faster its different so we might have an opportunity to indiscernible pricing a little longer its definitely an opportunity to outperform jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay the couple more here slide also appreciate all of the information here but its pretty draconian model input for your reserve levels and i just i applaud you for that but whats your thinking on provisioning and reserves as a percentage of loans going forward from here because it already seems like you have some pretty challenging economic scenarios built in brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah were going to continue to watch the economic forecasts and see where this might play out we are putting through a fairly pessimistic forecast but we expected continued growth loans we will continue to provision for that and we will not i dont believe in the nearterm were going to be pulling back related to a more optimistic forecast in the nearterm james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah i just feel like this is the right approach for us in this economic environment theres just so much uncertainty out there were just going to continue to do the right thing and make sure we have plenty of reserves and obviously provide for the great growth we expect to see for the rest of the year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay you kind of provided a segue into my last question jim but obviously theres a difference between what we all read about and what were seeing in your numbers and other bank numbers as well so maybe the segue is to integration theres been some public stuff that the integration maybe didnt go as well as planned but its pretty easy to cherry pick a challenging scenario and amplify it so how do you think you did and it sounded like in your earlier comments you said its starting to normalize again so just give us an update on that thanks james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp yeah sure we feel like that first of all the data and systems conversion were incredibly well i was in here on a couple of sundays ago and we bounced out very early on sunday morning our commercial clients adapted to our new systems very well theres just a lot of retail we had clients and theres just a lot of clients getting them to register their debit cards and getting them through their online and mobile channels so we feel really good about it overall and certainly again its easy to pick the handful of clients that maybe have said something but we continue to believe overall we feel really pleased were at and more importantly its largely behind us in a rearview mirror going forward so i dont know mark what else would you add to that mark g sander a president chief operating officer old national bancorp old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 i think were in a good spot with our clients in all of our business segments as you said earlier jim we had a busy couple of weeks that were on the back half of now and so i spent a lot of time in the last couple weeks visiting with commercial clients and holding banking centers and so you see the connection that our teams have with their clients i think were in a really good spot in total jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you appreciate it james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks jon operator thank you for your question jon our next question comes from the line of david long with raymond james david your line is now open david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning everyone james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp good morning david david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc i wanted to ask about the little bit longer term on the net interest margin looking out to maybe i appreciate the guidance that you gave for the next couple of quarters but as you look to do you see some pressure on an reported nim at all as deposit betas pick up and maybe some of the purchase accounting accretion wanes a bit brendon b falconer a chief financial officer old national bancorp yeah they will start to burn off accretion as we get into to but right now we get fed funds rate increases that theyre moving out beyond so well continue to benefit from that were also repricing a big chunk of our loan book at a much higher kind of mediumterm yield so i think we still have some room to grow that and expand that margin into david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks brendon and then on the ma side of things it sounds like across the industry talks are down right now but just curious how you guys are thinking about maybe into next year do you have an appetite to bolt something on or make another larger acquisition is there any appetite for that or how are you thinking about sort of the next step in the ma cycle for you guys old national bancorp onb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 26jul2022 james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp well i would start with never say never but we are incredibly focusing on continuing to integrate this partnership this was a transformational partnership and we feel really good about where were at with the integration of the clients and the team members but theres still work to do and so we will continue to do that as a team and if opportunities come along well definitely take a look at them but we really need to be focused on the current integration and growing organically first and i do think things are very quiet out there as you would imagine i still feel very close to whats going on in the world and i think things are very quiet out there but our first job is to take care of our existing clients and grow organically and if the timing is right and the opportunity is good enough the pricing is right well definitely take a look david j long q analyst raymond james associates inc got it thanks for the color thanks for taking my questions james c ryan a chief executive officer director old national bancorp thanks thanks david good to hear from you operator thank you for your question david there are no further questions at this time id like to turn the call back to jim ryan for closing remarks james c ryan chief executive officer director old national bancorp well great to be with everybody this quarter
