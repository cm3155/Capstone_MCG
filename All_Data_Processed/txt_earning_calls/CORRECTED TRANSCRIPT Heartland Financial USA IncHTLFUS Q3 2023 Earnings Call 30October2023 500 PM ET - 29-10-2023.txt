call over to bryan for more details on our performance and financials bryan r mckeag executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks bruce and good afternoon as bruce just described htlf performed well in a challenging environment this quarter reporting earnings per share of with loan growth of million which was with loan growth of million which was fully funded by the increase of million in customer deposits reported quarterly results included charter consolidation restructuring costs of million which reduced eps by heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 in addition net gains and losses on investments and other asset sales and writedowns were low at a net loss of just over before i go into more detail i want to remind everyone that our third quarter earnings release and investor presentation are both available in the investor relations section of htlfs website so ill start my comments with the provision for credit losses which was million the provision reflects our stable credit quality including a reduction of nearly million in nonperforming loans lower chargeoffs at basis points of total loans and a continued low delinquency rate of basis points of total loans at quarterend the total allowance for lendingrelated credit losses which includes both the allowance on loans and unfunded commitments decreased million to million or of total loans moving to the rest of the balance sheet bruce has already covered loans and deposits so ill start with investments investments declined almost million during the quarter to billion representing of assets with a tax equivalent yield of due to the increase in mid to longterm interest rates in our quarter end the unrealized loss on our available for sale portfolio increased million to million the relatively small heldtomaturity portfolio of million or of investments has an unrecorded negative fair value mark of million the available for sale portfolio has a modified duration of just under years however the hedges we have placed on million of our longer dated municipals and agencybacked secured mortgagebacked securities reduces the effective duration to just over years moving to liquidity htlfs liquidity profile at quarterend is strong and stable with billion of principal cash flow coming off our securities portfolio over the next months with million expected next quarter second a low level of outstanding borrowings and billion of available capacity with the fed and fhlb third we have several fed fund borrowing lines and broker deposit sources that remain open and available fourth our customer deposit base is granular and welldiversified with over of total deposits either insured or collateralized fifth our loantodeposit ratio is and when removing all wholesale deposits it remains low with cash and unpledged available for sale securities totals billion and lastly the holding company cash position stands at over million which is over times our current annualized interest and dividend payments in addition our dividend payout is relatively low at of current eps with regards to capital regulatory capital ratios remained strong with common equity tier at just over and total riskbased capital ratio of nearly adjusted for unrealized losses on our investments these ratios remain well above capitalized levels at approximately and respectively the tangible common equity ratio decreased basis points to at quarterend the decline in market value of investments was partially offset by an increase in fair value of swaps this quarter resulting in a net decrease of basis points that is attributable to the accumulated other comprehensive income or aoci moving to the income statement starting with revenue net interest income totaled million this quarter which was million lower than the prior quarter the net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis held up well falling basis points this quarter to which was close to our expected range of nim in the low to mid3 the decrease this quarter included a basis point decline in purchase accounting accretion noninterest income of million this quarter was down million from the prior quarter excluding security losses core non interest income was down million to million falling short of our expectation of million to million the primary driver of the miss was capital markets fees which were million lower than last quarter heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 shifting to expenses noninterest expenses totaled million this quarter thats up million from last quarter however excluding restructuring tax credit costs and asset gains and losses the run rate of recurring operating expenses decreased million to million coming in better than our forecast of million to million the decrease was driven by million lower advertising costs and million decrease in professional fees as we close out next quarter htlf expects loan growth of million to million to be primarily funded by customer deposit growth of million to million in addition we expect an additional million of seasonal draws on ag lines of credit that we anticipate will be repaid in the first quarter of achieving these loan and deposit growth expectations enables the bulk of investment cash flows to be utilized to decrease wholesale deposits and shortterm borrowings net interest margin on a tax equivalent basis is expected to stabilize in the range excluding any fed moves prior to yearend provision for credit losses is projected to remain in the million to million range this assumes relatively stable credit performance and a manageable level of economic contraction over the next months core noninterest income excluding investment gains or losses is expected to be flat at million to million we expect a reduction in consumer nsf and od fees as we institute new policies across our now single charter customer base and we see a continued decline in mortgagerelated revenue both of these will be offset by higher capital markets fees recurring operating expenses are expected to be million to million this excludes any new fdic assessments that may be levied next quarter charter consolidation restructuring costs are forecast to be million to million next quarter which includes both the final consolidation implementation expenses as well as expenses to complete several span of control improvements next quarter as we achieve the remaining benefits of the charter consolidation project we also expect to have some additional restructuring costs and real estate writedowns that will be booked over the next couple of quarters as we begin to execute the next phase of facilities optimization and other htlf initiatives we will have more details to share next quarter regarding our views of the performance including the impact of these new htlf initiatives and finally we believe a tax rate of excluding tax credits is a reasonable run rate and with that ill turn the call back over to bruce for questions bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks bryan latif we can open up the line for questions heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you sir operator instructions our first question comes from the line of andrew liesch of piper sandler andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey guys thanks for taking the questions good afternoon just on the margin guide of around thats up from so do you think you could even rise beyond that irrespective of what the fed does bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc im always cautious to go too far on the margin but the reason we think its going to go up from where we were is last quarter right at the end is when we saw the paydown of the wholesale borrowings and funding and deposits so thats a carryover and come down a little bit this quarter as we hopefully get the deposit growth that were looking for and we also saw a slowing in the mix shift that was going from noninterestbearing to interest bearing account so as those two things waned at the end of the third quarter and go into the fourth quarter we think we can see the margin go up a tick or two beyond that theres so many variables in there andrew i hate to go too far and get ahead of ourselves andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it so i mean at this point do you think another basis points would matter that much bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc not at the current betas that are out there on the deposit side if we got back to normal betas which for us are about a beta this quarter for example our betas were over because of the catchup and everything so if we get back to normal betas there would be a little bit from a fed move but not a lot at this point were kind of topping out on the benefit andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it got it and then just on your commentary on the tax rate like this quarter closer to so was there a benefit to the tax rate from that tax credit amortization that you mentioned earlier and operating expenses bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah yeah for this quarter yeah for this last past quarter yeah indiscernible andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 got it okay got you i will factor that in the remodeling all right thanks for taking the questions here i will step back operator thank you our next question comes from the line of damon delmonte of kbw damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good evening guys i hope everybodys doing well today just wanted to ask a little bit on the credit front its nice to see npls not really move at all sorry npas not really move at all and it looks like within there you had npls coming down and a little bit of a tickup here in oreo is that just a loan that moved into oreo status or were there some other moving parts there nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc correct damon this is nathan jones thats a credit we had in our nonpass its a multifamily credit we felt after looking at it there were some disagreement between sponsors it was the best to move quickly on this one and just drive a fast conclusion for the best overall resolution so thats what we did but we dont think its systemic or any other issues that go with that damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats good and then with regards to the outlook for loan growth you guys seem to be continuing to fire on all cylinders here what areas of your footprint are you seeing like the best opportunities has that changed at all in the last couple of quarters or its still kind of the western side of the footprint bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc damon this is bruce its still really the mountain west to the west to the southwest its a little lighter in the midwest right now but i would call it steady its all of the calling efforts that weve been putting in actually for probably in the last months are really starting to pay dividends and because we are open for business weve been recruiting weve been calling on new customers and thats really helped when some of the banks in some of the markets that we operate in theyve been sputtering a little bit trying to decide whether theyre going to be in business or not damon delmonte q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it okay thats all that i have for now ill step back thank you bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks damon operator thank you our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy of stephens inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon everybody bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc hi terry bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc hi terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi so with the charter consolidation complete can you just remind me of the million of savings how much of that do you think falls to the bottom line lets say in versus how much of that will be reinvested into growth and really how could that or how does that play into the htlf in terms of accelerating or organic growth across the bank bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc i think well double team this one ill take the first part in terms of what has fallen to the bottom line we have a slide in our deck i think its let me just find that real quick i think its slide where we show what our core operating expenses to assets has done over time and so we started this back in we were running at about of cost to assets were now down this quarter down to if you do the math on about billion weve been about billion that whole time give or take thats about million of run rate reduction in our expenses so the millions in there we do have a little bit so its more than that theres some other things in there but i think weve gotten a million plus i think well get just a little bit more here as we do the span of control changes here in the fourth quarter so thats what weve got steaming into next year however ill let bruce talk about what were planning to reinvest and a little bit more about htlf bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yes so terry youll hear us talk at the end of the year in the next quarter kind of more about htlf but i guess the way i think about it everything that bryan just described is really going to fall to the bottom line were going to be reinvesting the span of control as well as looking at management layers looking at our branch footprint looking at the size of our branch locations thats where were really going to get the investment dollars for next year in terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc understood and bryan appreciate all the forwardlooking commentary for the fourth quarter specifically the service charges which were million in the third quarter how much of a decline do you expect because of heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 the new policies that you mentioned and i guess what gives you confidence that the capital markets line will return bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah a couple of things there so i think its around well be implementing this in december terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc but the nsf reduction for q4 is about and then as i said mortgage banking for us has been coming down i think its going to continue to kind of fall off just not seeing a lot of good activity there the capital markets piece i think third quarter was just soft for us i think theres some things that we now see coming into the fourth quarter and i think bruce may have a couple of comments here but i feel pretty confident we can make that up there bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yes so terry one of the things on the capital markets front weve taken a really hard look at our pipeline and weve really spent the last probably two weeks maybe even three weeks out there talking to a lot of our customers who currently have floating rate debt sort of adding value showing them the inverted yield curve and looking at a three year or ph four year out they can actually reduce by doing a swap they can reduce their interests cost so weve seen our pipelines really begin to grow as weve been out there talking to customers and helping them look at how to create some fixed rate debt from floating on their own balance sheet which help them manage their own interest rate risk terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thanks terry bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc thanks terry operator thank you operator instructions we have a followup question from the line of andrew liesch of piper sandler heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co hey thank you guys do you have handy the balance of shared national credits that you have on balance sheet bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc yeah first of all shared national credits for us its not really a focus our strategy is really indiscernible its really gaining that exposure with some of the companies in the markets we really want kind of a deeper relationship with and exposure in those markets but overall if you take all participations that we have that we purchased them where were not the lead bank its only about of our book its mostly ci and really weve maintained discipline we maintained the rest of our portfolio they are very disciplined both geographic diversification as well as industry diversification i think our largest concentration ph then have been manufacturing so we feel good about that book and where were at bruce anything youd like to add bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah andrew weve really viewed this as not an asset play here but its a relationship play in all of our transactions whether were a buyer or a seller we have a noncredit relationships and i think and correct me if im wrong nathan but i think that we have purchased about but weve also sold about or nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc thats about bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so its about a net of the total book is a net of about or of our total portfolio andrew brian liesch q analyst piper sandler co got it very helpful thank you so much operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jeff rulis of da davidson jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah thanks good afternoon just a question on the as youve wind down the charter consolidation more specific to maybe the folks that were really assigned to that process i just wanted to see if theres a rotation or theres a reassignment of those and maybe that comes as part of htlf or just want to get the sense for if there was a head count that was sort of assigned to oversee that and did they pivot and are there any expected positive impact as they kind of relook at other projects bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 yeah so if you think about i guess ill answer it this way we have very few dedicated folks to the project that were on our payroll and so within those restructuring charges were very little salaries for folks so ph our internal people will get reassigned to the projects and other things that were looking at for htlf and again they were doing their day job as well as doing the consolidation we thought we might have to do more but the consolidations quite frankly went very smooth and congratulations to all the folks at htlf because i think they did a great job of getting the projects done and doing their day jobs and all the other things that we needed to do so it was very good most of that cost that we used people for was external consultants that came in and helped us jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay thats helpful thanks and just to circle back maybe for nathan on the nonperforming loans some reductions there but looked like there was even a balance that kind of came in thats new on that down but just in general credit comments does it sound like youre too concerned about systemic changes but maybe if you could touch on what was added and areas that kind of youre looking at that are softening at all nathan r jones a executive vice president chief credit officer heartland financial usa inc yeah our nonperforming was down about million but there was a slight increase thats really an ag credit and the majority of that is actually usda guaranteed so we dont have large concerns there about the increase we continue to monitor it were watching the economy as well we follow up with different economists across trying to understand and talk to my peers where were seeing weak spots we just dont see anything at this point thats systemic to be concerned about but we continue to monitor it very diligently though bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc and i think jeff if youre referring to the table that we have in the back where we show the ins and outs of nonperformers jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc so million item that ended up in oreo that went through so it grossed up the in and the out of nonperformers it was in performing loans at the end of last quarter became a problem we jumped on it right away so in our tables we kind of flowed that as a plus and a minus through npls to get to oreo jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay so indiscernible heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co in the new maybe it kind of shows new nonperformers but it was like a temporary new because it came in then went out bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc right jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co got it okay bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc we took the new and the reduction both down by million then i think youd see what really was the net other ins and outs of the nonperformance jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co appreciate it bryan r mckeag a executive vice president chief financial officer heartland financial usa inc ph the nonnonperformance jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co yeah okay thanks and bruce it sounds like well kind of give you some time on the htlf but you did touch on geographies and kind of taken a look at what would be the metrics or the demographics and not to oversimplify it but where do you i mean i think the answer is efficiency but anything that youd lead us into before we get that reveal of kind of geographies that makes sense some that dont in that discussion bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc yeah so well get in a lot more detail the next time we all talk but look when you look at our footprint its clear that we dont have scale in a fair amount of our markets and our longterm goal is both efficiency and growth potential for us and so we are looking very heavily not only at the branch network but the actual geography to make decisions on whether we should expand or we should contract in those geographies jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co okay well look forward to the update thank you heartland financial usa inc htlf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 30oct2023 bruce k lee a president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc but i would say the keys for us its all about eps its all about expense control and what does it do to our tce i mean those are sort of the three things that are always in the forefront of our minds as were making decisions about geographies the branch play that weve been talking about as well as span of control and layers of management now that we have the charter consolidation done we can actually execute some of these things but we have to get the consolidations done so that we could then move to the next phase jeffrey allen rulis q analyst da davidson co thank you operator thank you as there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the call back over to mr lee for closing comments bruce k lee president chief executive officer director heartland financial usa inc thank you latif in closing htlf had a solid third quarter we continue to add relationships grow customer deposits grow quality loans maintain stable credit quality and drive efficiency while we remain focused on continuing to achieve organic growth were also focused on reducing expenses increasing eps and growing tce over the next few quarters we continue to evaluate our balance sheet and capital structure to maximize efficiency and flexibility and were analyzing our expense structure including geographies branch footprint management layers and span of control well provide more guidance in the
