farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning everyone and thanks for joining our call today we reported second quarter earnings of million or per share average loans grew to billion and the continued focus on fee income helped drive our second highest noninterest income quarter in our history expenses declined and our disciplined approach to credit produced a third consecutive quarter of net recovery beyond our compelling financial results we have launched a transformational expansion and support for small businesses in the second quarter we introduced tailored products designed to improve access to capital and enhance cash management capabilities for these important customers while also providing access to valuable business insights and resources coupled with our recognized sba achievement we believe we are wellpositioned to be a leading bank for small business providing the tools they need to achieve their goals our emphasis on supporting small business is an important part of our overall commitment to communities you can read more about our other community and sustainability efforts in our corporate responsibility report that was recently published on comericacom comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 our southeast and mountain west expansionary investments continue to perform well as our bankers were active in the market adding new relationships and building the pipeline strong relative economic trends in these regions coupled with the prevalence of target customer base could create opportunity for continued growth over time moving to a summary of our results on slide average loans grew billion average deposits decreased billion due to customer diversification efforts related to industry disruption in the first quarter and the ongoing impact of fed monetary actions we saw increased stabilization in both interestbearing and noninterestbearing deposits in the second half of the quarter and we believe diversification efforts are largely behind us as we expected net interest income declined as we saw the full impact of first quarter deposit flows and funding activity credit quality outperformed with another quarter of net recoveries and our criticized loan percentage remained below our historical average noninterest income was near record levels and expenses declined profitability improved indiscernible capital position as we generated an estimated cet1 ratio of above our strategic target in all it was a strong quarter for comerica and i will now turn the call over to jim who will review our results in more detail james j herzog senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thanks curt and good morning everyone turning to slide loan growth came in just above expectations as average balances increased from the first quarter increased selectivity drove a slight decline in commitments and utilization increased almost but remained below historical averages growth in our commercial real estate business of over million continued to be driven largely by construction of multifamily and industrial projects originated over the last two years in addition to the slower pace of payoffs recent origination activity and pipeline have significantly declined our commercial real estate strategy remains highly selective with a focus on class a projects and our office exposure is intentionally limited large corporate loans grew million as we won new customer relationships and financed acquisitions for existing customers national dealer services benefited from new customer acquisition and while floor plan inventories continue to grow they remain below prepandemic levels typical second quarter seasonality resulted in a million increase in average mortgage banker finance loans however consistent with our strategic exit of that business we expect most of our mortgage banker balances to be paid off by the end of slide provides an overview of our deposit activity for the quarter average deposit balances declined in line with expectations conversations pivoted away from banking industry stability as customers refocused on broader macroeconomic issues such as risk of recession and elevated rates throughout the quarter customer deposit balances continued to normalize and we observed relatively stable trends since midmay industry funding pressures drove deposit competition and interestbearing deposit costs increased to basis points however we feel our dynamic pricing strategy and relationship approach allowed us to maintain our forecasted deposit betas and protect balances while the rate environment further pressured noninterestbearing deposits we continue to view our deposit mix as a competitive advantage providing a more stable and costeffective funding source than our peers with strategic investments underway to enhance payments and other treasury management products in addition to comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 our national small business banking strategy we see opportunities to further improve our attractive deposit profile over time as shown on slide our strong liquidity position provided flexibility we maintained excess cash repaid maturing fhlb advances and our remaining liquidity capacity increased our quarterend loantodeposit ratio was still below our 15year average and strategic actions announced in the second quarter are expected to keep that ratio in the mid at yearend cash balances at the holding company position us to repay our million debt due this summer and very light remaining unsecured funding maturities create flexibility to manage funding needs and cash levels over time periodend balances in our securities portfolio on slide declined almost million with paydowns maturities and a million negative marktomarket adjustment our securities strategy remains unchanged as we start reinvesting in the third quarter of and we maintain our entire portfolio as available for sale providing full transparency and management flexibility although we have modest treasury maturities through the end of the year larger scheduled repayments in and are projected to benefit liquidity profitability and our unrealized losses within aoci altogether we expect a improvement in unrealized securities losses over the next two years as our portfolio is pledged to enhance our liquidity position we do not anticipate any need to sell securities and therefore unrealized losses should not impact income turning to slide net interest income decreased million to million in line with expectations as the benefit of loan volume and one more day were offset by the impact of wholesale funding lower deposit balances a shift in deposit mix and deposit pricing a significant portion of the funding and deposit activity occurred late in the first quarter so results reflect a full quarter impact of those actions with our strategic management of our asset sensitivity position the impact of rates was nominal as shown on slide successful execution of our interest rate strategy and the current composition of our balance sheet favorably position us with minimal negative exposure to a gradual basis points or basis points on average decline in interest rates by strategically managing our swap and securities portfolios while considering balance sheet dynamics we intend to maintain our insulated position over time our proven discipline produced another quarter of excellent credit quality as highlighted on slide once again we posted net recoveries although we do not project this trend to continue modest migration drove an increase in criticized loans however at under of total loans they remain well below historical averages nonaccrual loans declined and inflows to not accruals remained low at million migration loan growth and a continued weak economic outlook drove the million provision expense and the allowance for credit losses increased to given the environment we increased oversight in portfolios with greater relative exposure to elevated rates such as leveraged loans in our commercial real estate business however we remain very comfortable with these portfolio metrics and expect continued migration to be manageable noninterest income on slide continued to outperform growing million from an already strong first quarter noncustomer income contributed to results with increases in fhlb dividends and boli in addition to customer related growth in fiduciary and card although not shown as a variance to prior quarter capital markets exceeded expectations as we repeated strong first quarter results risk management income related to our hedging strategy saw a modest decrease and should continue to vary based on the rate environment while noncustomer income comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 can be hard to predict we expect our strategic investments in products and services to drive further growth in capital efficiency income over time we remain excited about the results of these efforts todate expenses on slide declined million in line with expectations quarteroverquarter expenses benefited from several large first quarter items that did not recur netting million related to the ameriprise transition a favorable state tax refund and a real estate asset writedown seasonally lower salaries and benefits expense and other noninterest expenses were partially offset by increased outside processing fdic insurance and software costs modernization efforts remained on track as we incurred a total of million in expenses advancing our wealth management corporate facilities technology and retail strategies we continue to selectively prioritize strategic investments designed to further enhance our financial results while remaining committed to prudently managing expenses commensurate with our earnings power slide highlights our strong capital position with share buybacks paused capital generation from profitability outpaced loan growth driving our estimated cet1 further above our target to strategic actions including the exit of mortgage banker finance and increased selectivity across the rest of the portfolio are expected to elevate capital ratios through the end of this year higher rates increased unrealized losses in our securities and swap portfolios reducing our tangible common equity ratio to adjusting for the impact of aoci our tangible common equity ratio of would have been although potential regulatory changes have not yet been proposed considering our size portfolio and projections we feel very good about our ability to support our customers and comply with anticipated capital requirements our outlook for is on slide and assumes no significant change in the economic environment we continue to project full year average loan growth of the strategic exit of mortgage banker finance and increased selectivity is expected to keep loan balances relatively flat into the third quarter our projected full year average deposit decline of to is attributable to quantitative tightening that began last year and the impact of the first quarter industry events assuming continued normalization of deposit trends and additional fomc actions we expect only a modest deposit decline through the second half of the year we expect our highest year of net interest income in growing to over last years record results although we anticipate shortterm rates will remain high through the remainder of the year our asset sensitivity position is designed to protect our strong profitability by minimizing the negative impact of rates when they decline credit quality remained excellent and we expect continued migration to remain manageable given the strong performance through the first two quarters we forecast full year net chargeoffs to remain below our normal to basis points range noninterest income exceeded expectations for the first half of the year and we expect full year to grow to over benefits from noncustomer income related to fhlb dividends and risk management income are expected to continue but likely at declining rates as we repay maturing advances and rates normalize while we expect strong foreign exchange income and derivative income we anticipate levels to moderate from the incredible performance todate even with potential headwinds in the second half of the year relative to the first half the overall noninterest income run rate remains compelling noninterest expenses are expected to increase approximately yearover year and of that growth is the result of higher pension expense for talent acquisition investments comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 benefiting our deposit strategy and the enhanced regulatory and compliance focus given our size and business model are expected to create some expense pressure compared to prior guidance as we look into the third quarter the cost of filling open positions and other expenses pressure should largely be offset by an expected credit to modernization expense driven by corporate facilities although the precise timing for this type of credit can be challenging to predict prudent expense management remains a priority as we balance expense pressures with the need to invest for the future strong profitability is expected to further grow our capital position in excess of our target and we believe that trend will continue until we resume share repurchases now ill turn the call back to curt curtis chatman farmer chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jim slide summarizes our competitive advantage with the local delivery of sophisticated comprehensive product and industry expertise by tenured bankers we feel we encapsulate the best features of the largest and smallest competitors diversification remains an important

leading bank for business with strong retail and wealth management capability we play a unique role supporting our customers as a trusted longterm banking partner thanks for your time this morning and now wed be happy to take some questions comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of john pancari from evercore please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning john john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning good morning on the deposit growth outlook i know you lowered your deposit growth expectation despite the end of period deposits actually increasing and coming in a little bit better than expected i know you indicated you expect only a modest deposit decline in the back half can you maybe just give us some of the color around the rationale for the lowered growth expectation and what type of trends that you expect to develop as you look at the back half thanks james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah good morning john its jim thanks for the question yeah the relatively stable or modest decrease was relative to the second quarter average of billion we do expect to stay very close to that on average through the end of the year there are some dynamics turning on below that core deposits will probably take a small stepdown from the average of q2 just because in the first half of the second quarter we did have just some very modest runoff but then again we added some brokered deposits also that roughly offset that during the quarter that on an average basis will carry through and so we do think by the end of the year well still be hovering around that billion to billion number we were a little bit elevated on as you see in the bar on the right and so i would not expect all of those balances to stick around we had million of card that was elevated relative to its typical average and then we did have some elevated customer balances on that i would not expect to stick around either so that is a little bit of an inflated number i would maybe stick more to the average guidance of gravitating down to billion to billion by the end of the year on average john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks for that color and then separately also on the deposit front in terms of the noninterest bearing mix i know its current where do you see that bottoming already i think youre at your pre pandemic level you were running at around of the total deposit so where do you think that could bottom and then separately sorry if i missed it but if you can give us your updated throughcycle deposit beta expectation i believe you were thinking mid and youre currently at now thanks james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 yes we are on average as well as june hovering in that to area its consistent with what i said early in june in a major investor conference we still think we are going to dip just slightly below so think about maybe to the average ratio was a little bit elevated because it doesnt consider a little bit of the runoff that occurred early in the second quarter the june ratio of is a little elevated due to the elevated noninterestbearing balances that id referred to before and so i kind of think of us being on a kind of a spot basis if you ignore the elevated balances i really think of us today as being to and i see that dipping down to maybe to by the end of the year keep in mind that there are a number of variables involved here noninterestbearing flows will be the most important variable but to the extent were successful in bringing back interestbearing deposits that could push that ratio down too and we would of course welcome back those interestbearing deposits in terms of the beta question yeah we still think were going to end up on an accumulated basis in the mid i mean right now i have implied in the guidance but pretty consistent with what weve been saying for the last few months so were still right around that mid50 area john pancari q analyst evercore isi great thanks so much jim james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey everyone jim i just want to drill down on your answer to johns question so the stability or modest decline in deposits through the rest of the year youre saying thats coming from outflows slowing its not because you had strong outflows this quarter but you plugged the hole with brokered deposits so youre not saying you need to use brokered for the second half to remain fairly stable down a bit as outflows are slowing correct james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right to be clear we have really no plans to add brokered deposits between now and the end of the year i think were at a pretty good resting spot we do think the customer core deposits have very much stabilized we do see whether we define it by what we were in the second quarter average or if you look at june with some elevated balances and you normalize for that number for those elevated balances from there we see just some very modest decline between now and the end of the year comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 now we have not really factored in a material amount of seasonal deposits which in the past have come in but seasonal patterns have gone out the window over the last year were not exactly sure what to expect there so there could be some opportunity there but overall if you adjust that billion on june for card and maybe a modest amount of elevated balances we would see just a modest decline from that level on assuming we dont get a large inflow of seasonal deposits steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thanks and if we think about margin with the outflow of noninterestbearing right replacing those with basically time deposits thats really pressured the nim so if that was the ninth inning are we at a bottom for the nim right now james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc if you look at our guidance steven we do have just a little bit more pressure to go there you see the net interest income guidance that we imply we do see a small stepdown in q3 and then a smaller stepdown in q4 now as a partial offset to that i never like to talk about nim percentage because our nim percentage can bounce around for reasons that dont correlate with income whether itd be the level of securities whether itd be the level of cash that we carry and the reasons for carrying that cash if we do see cash balances go down ph at least that is putting a bit of a drag on the nim if they go down to normal levels i would see the nim being very close to where its at now you might see another bps or bps downward pressure in the nim as the deposit mix is roughly offset by the smaller balance sheet as we deflate for that excess cash if we dont reduce cash balances and my forecast assumes we do but if we hold at these cash levels that were currently at you could see another bps bps of nim but again im not expecting that at this point im more focused on getting the cash down as things continue to stabilize so were very near the bottom just maybe a few bps depending on what we do with our cash position steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah yeah thanks and maybe a final question i know were going to get the new capital rules fairly soon but you guys have billion of assets curt how do you think about crossing that billion asset threshold organically i know this is not a great environment to be considering ma transactions but when you think about just the capital burden the cost burden indiscernible potentially does it make sense to cross that organically curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah steve this is curt ill take that question and youre right we are within a certain range of that billion mark at around billion in assets and assuming that with just the organic growth that we would eventually cross that number weve been planning now for the last two years and have a little bit more work to do just to be prepared for whatever regulatory increased oversight going back in to the stress test capital planning et cetera if we became a category iv bank comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 we think just through organic growth that would probably be a few years out and our view has continued to be that were going to focus on doing the right thing for the shareholders growing the company growing the assets of the company as we have over our 174year history and if that means crossing that billion mark it would mean crossing that billion mark but we think that were trying to think about it from a longterm perspective and just trying to be prepared for whatever ph cost or regulatory oversight might be associated with that if it is crossing it from an organic perspective steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you for all the color curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks steve operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala from bank of america please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning i guess just following up on steves last question on these capital changes even if you dont cross billion what are the changes you expect to make in terms of just balance sheet management either loantodeposit ratio liquidity et cetera once these rules are out curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc you know the rules this is curt ebrahim the most anticipated ruling is really around the treatment of aoci in regulatory ratios and while all the conversation thus far has been focused on banks north of billion we do anticipate that there might be some eventual phase in below billion nothing official on that right now but were just trying to be prepared if that comes to pass if you look at sort of where we are from a cet1 perspective at if you factor in aoci we would be slightly south of like and so we would have a little bit of work to do to raise capital but we believe it would be phased in and just through normal earnings of the company we could get back to an appropriate cet1 level we do not believe that wed have to go to the external market to raise capital to get back to that level so we think were wellpositioned with whatever ruling might come out and again given that were below the billion mark we think we would have some more time if it got applied to banks below that level ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and indiscernible the loantodeposit ratio in the still seems like the right place to be comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc i believe ebrahim youre asking about the stabilization of the loantodeposit ratio ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah we do expect to stay in the mid or we do think it was again just slightly elevated on june but we do have a plan to stay in the mid and certainly some of the asset optimization things were doing will help ensure of that so were right around that area that were comfortable in curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc and it also is below our sort of historical averages as well where weve normally operated ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and just one separate question if i may given your customer base give us a sense of your outlook in terms of credit health of the customer theres not a lot of like corporate bonds that have yet repriced to the higher rates over the last months whats your expectation in terms of the next year and the likelihood of a recession soft landing et cetera melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah ebrahim this is melinda ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc obviously the credit performance continues to be really strong it was a really nice quarter for us obviously third quarter of net recoveries kind of unprecedented nonperforming assets again modest decline and very low inflow but we did see an increase in the criticized category which is exactly what weve been expecting to see over the last couple of quarters the preponderance of the increase that we saw is in our what i call core middle market ci portfolio which would include a number of leveraged loans in that automotive supplier sector so again we have expected that we would begin to see normalization its taken a couple of extra quarters to actually get there weve been bouncing around the bottom for a long time our current economic forecast that we use in our cecl process does call for a mild recession and i think whether its a mild recession or we end up with a soft landing i think were prepared for a mild recession as it relates to the reserve build and the reserve build this quarter really reflects kind of the portfolio growth as jim said as well as that migration but as of now comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 we dont see a lot of loss content and as jim guided we think that for the remainder of this year well be below that average that weve typically guided ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc welcome operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom from rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good morning melinda just a followup on that one how do you expect do you expect more normalization and how do you generally expect those numbers to progress on criticized melinda a chausse a senior executive vice president chief credit officer comerica inc yeah i mean i think we expect that well continue to have some migration in the portfolio there is no doubt that the the customer base has been incredibly resilient obviously came into the last couple of years challenges very low levered lots of liquidity lots of availability but inflationary pressures over the last months are starting to show up in the portfolio in terms of pressure around growth in net margin so cash flows are a little more stretched and i would expect that well continue to see some additional migration i think were very well reserved and all of that is taken into sort of the process that we go through each quarter jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then maybe this somewhat ties into it but maybe to repeat but you talked about increased selectivity in lending can you talk a little bit more about that kind of where youve been a little bit more cautious and then the cre number it sounds like that was more construction projects funding up i think you said things are slowing there but can you just confirm that peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc jon its peter comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc yeah i think when we talk about it its really around quite candidly pricing expectations across the loan portfolio and we continue to be really selective about it ive said in the past were more focused on sort of credit than we are maybe trying to earn business on pricing over time and right now between those two options we want to make sure that were earning for the company and so our selectivity and expectations on pricing and i think youre seeing that across the industry just as capital is kind of being contained here that were being very careful about where we deploy it were taking care of existing customers our expectations on profitability are higher relationship are higher thats kind of across the portfolio i think in commercial real estate specifically wed actually kind of started dialing back a little bit on that even in the beginning of this year or maybe end of last year just starting to be very careful and taking care of our existing sponsors weve got great sponsors and we feel really good about the portfolio very limited office exposure watching whats happening in multifamily we expect though our projects to kind of carry commercial real estate balances really into next year so we feel good about it where we are we feel good about it from a credit standpoint our sponsor standpoint but our expectations on pricing have definitely gone up this year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good thank you for that and then just one for you ralph sic curt maybe kind of an odd question but youve dealt with covid youve dealt with the funding crisis as ceo so its been a hell of a run for you but do you feel like its largely business as usual for comerica right now or are you still fighting some of these questions from depositors and this funding crisis thats happened over the last four months curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc well jon first of all im honored that you referred to me as ralph because i know indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc did i say that i apologize curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah our longterm chairman ralph babb indiscernible jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc im under my desk right now curt comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc and hes doing great and remains very engaged jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right i was asking you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc indiscernible just a minute about the comment to your question that you asked me the last to days a number of us have been out in the markets visiting with both employees in town hall formats but also with customers in michigan california the carolinas texas florida et cetera and i would say the conversations really have shifted for the most part back to more business as usual as you would refer to it i mean customers are asking us about things that customers normally ask us about the economy about interest rates about availability to capital and credit what were seeing in terms of ma activity in various industries et cetera industry outlooks and so i feel like that things have definitely stabilized in terms of customer communication and customer conversations and were focused as peter said on taking care of our existing customers and thats something that i think we do very well weve got really great longstanding relationships and i might just remind you and the other listeners that right throughout the crisis we did not lose customers we saw some customers diversify our deposits and we hope over time and seeing some signs early signs of that that customers will bring some of those deposits back indiscernible moved out as you alluded to earlier it has been an interesting time i became the ceo in april of and you know all the events that have occurred since then but i think our company is so resilient to manage through years of all the disruptions that have occurred in the economy in the world during that time and we just do i think a great job of rallying together and it really pretty much is business as usual i referred to in my comments earlier a lot of the things that were focused on and we remain focused on those beyond just taking care of our employees and our customers expanding into new markets focusing on product capabilities focusing on small business growing the commercial bank growing wealth management growing the retail bank and we feel like the future for us remains very bright as an organization jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay well curt ive never had so many emails in response to my questions but curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah indiscernible comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc but i know youre doing a great job thank you curt curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc sure operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston from ubs please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc hello brody good morning brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc good morning everyone hey i just wanted to i wanted to ask on the tech and life sciences deposits i noticed that those continue to move down a little bit but it looked like the rate of change kind of slowed there i was wondering kind of what drove that decline if its kind of back to normal cash burn for those clients and kind of what the i guess is there a growth outlook kind of for that business line now that theres been this disruption with the largest competitor there no longer or failing peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc hey brody this is peter yeah the decline in deposits in tls we really started actually seeing that back middle of last year so i think that cash started being consumed in that space with all the things that youve kind of seen happening with tech i think what happened earlier this year probably accelerated that a little bit further but as far as where we go from here were being very cautious about our relationships were watching whats going on in the vc community raising capital newcos that are being formed weve been in that business a long long time we plan to stay in it were looking at were very careful about where were adding people where were adding relationships and so i think that we will be in the business i think probably at some point youre going to youll start to see cash build again across the industry and certainly at comerica i dont know that its necessarily in the next six months i think weve probably got a little more cash burn going on in this space that said we are bringing on new relationships and as i said were adding people we feel really good about the industry and the opportunity over the long term but we probably got some time to go here of cash burn and i think a number of these companies are going to need to raise some capital and well see what happens in the industry going forward comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then i was hoping just within the aoci walk if you could give us some indication as to what the conditional prepayment rate youre assuming within your effective duration calculation is james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah brody its jim i mean that prepayment rate varies somewhat widely depending on the type of security of course we have some bullets in there on the commercial side that generally dont have much in the way of prepayment and then we have a number of various tranches of mbs securities that have some variance to them so i dont think theres any one number that would likely answer your question but we certainly have prepayment rates factored into that brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it is it reflective of kind of what the market is bearing on a quartertoquarter basis jim james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah absolutely thats something we prudently do every quarter is monitor the market prepayment rate so very much in line with the market brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it great and then i wanted to ask just on the fixed rate loan portfolio the portion of the portfolio thats fixed rate more purely fixed rate not so much the swap portion i wanted to get a sense for kind of what the quarterly repricing cadence looks like on that and kind of what the existing yield on that book is james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah that book is a relatively small part of our portfolio less than of our loans it does yield well below our current portfolio we havent disclosed the exact rate but i would say it is materially blown which isnt surprising given how fast interest rates have gone up contractual life on that is about eight years so remaining life would be about four years we do see it amortizing along a pretty straight line path amongst that fouryear remaining life and we see the i would say that fixed rate portfolio price is up probably bps a quarter we kind of parlay that along its percentage of the overall loan book youre looking at maybe indiscernible of loan yields going up because of the repricing in the fixed rate book so that will be a very small tailwind for us but it just depends on where the curve goes where theyre repriced at and how prepayment patterns kind of follow through there peter sefzik a senior executive vice president chief banking officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 its really one of the strengths of our model is the floating rate most of our loans are floating rate across our portfolio so were able to benefit on the actual loan book when the interest rates are going up like this to your question there brody james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc thats right and it gives us a lot more control too because we can more synthetically manage our assetliability position as opposed to being at the mercy of prepayment rates brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it and then last one for me i just was hoping for a reminder on the swaps the yield that you disclosed the for this year the for next year are those just the received fixed rate or is that a net rate and if it is just the received fixed do you happen to have a sense for what the current kind of pay floating rate is on those swaps james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah these are fixed received rates and the pay floating is pretty much aligned with libor 30day libor previously as the quarter progressed as well as a combination of monthly sofr and bsby of course libor is behind us now but pretty much aligns with monthly sofr monthly bsby so that obviously is changing as the federal reserve makes its changes and so on brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it is there any spread there over that rate james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah i mean you know that bsby sofr depending on where were at with the fomc increase coming up here obviously youre looking at kind of a pay rate in the range so that would give you the spread relative to this yield that you see here the received rate brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc thank you very much for taking the questions i appreciate it curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks brody operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia from morgan stanley please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 manan good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning i just wanted to follow up on the earlier line of questioning on deposit balances so you noted that deposits have stabilized and if i look at your last update at our conference in june to the end of the quarter nib has actually improved quite nicely even if i strip out the cardrelated deposits that you mentioned so can you talk about what drove that and what made june just such a strong month i know you said the conversations have moved back to business as usual but maybe you can expand on what changed in those conversations in the last three weeks of june for deposit customers specifically james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah i would say manan its jim really nothing changed were very much on the trajectory that we had forecasted and as i mentioned beyond card we did have some elevated customer balances on the noninterest bearing side really in the last few days of the month that are no longer with us depending on how you think about how often those types of balances come back were anywhere from another billion to billion elevated at the end of the month but again we often get these types of deposits too so i dont want to fully discount them but it is important to understand we were a little bit elevated on june curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc yeah i might just this is curt manan just add what id said earlier or expound on what i said earlier i think just as things have settled down the understanding that the concerns were maybe overplayed for the whole industry and customers are back just to more business as usual theyre talking to us about credit and fee income products and services and how we can take advantage or support them from an advisory standpoint but i think just getting the banking crisis out of the media and just the noise that was associated with those first couple of months dying down has really i think shifted the conversation quite a bit manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thats helpful and then just separately i realized the fdic special assessment hasnt been finalized but i was wondering once its finalized does that come out all in one quarter where theres a reserve or does it come out over the course of the two years as the proposal suggests james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc well were still waiting of course for the rule to be finalized and theres been a lot of input provided there so we really dont know where its going to end up i mean i think the best speculation is from a cash basis we would probably pay it once the rule is established but it would be recognized on an expense basis and therefore its impact to capital over a couple of years but there are a number of variables at play there in terms of all the input being provided so i think we just have to wait and see what the final rule has in it manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it thank you comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah and it would be a onetime hit in the capital though once it is recognized the rule is operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter from da davidson please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co good morning good morning i was wondering with deposit closer to stabilization or the outflow slowing net interest margin nearing a bottom do you think net interest income could stabilize in relative to the fourth quarter james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc we think its getting very close with the betas based on where the curve was on june we think betas will probably stop rising once you get to around decemberjanuary but of course youd have the full quarter effect of that probably dipping a little bit into were bringing loan balances down throughout the year most of that loan balance drop will occur in the fourth quarter so you could get a full quarter average of that kind of tripping into the first quarter of also so just because of those quartertoquarter bleedins i dont know that itll be stabilized in q1 of next year but i do think itll stabilize if not q1 probably in q2 there are some other variables going on in terms of how pricing plays out in the industry that could be a potential tailwind but yeah i think as we cross over the year youre very close to a bottom there and i would say by q2 were probably at an inflection point peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it thats helpful and then obviously theres a lot going on on the expense side that nonrecurring between the pensions the modernization can you just remind us what a normal expense growth rate is and is that more likely next year james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc we typically putting aside some abnormal ebbs and flows like those things relating to pension i mean we typically think of expenses as being in the range in terms of what we shoot for but thats going to vary from yeartoyear depending on what pressure is around us things like fdic can make a difference as that can be elevated for a year or two at a time again pension can be a big factor so i dont think any one year is ever going to exactly be the average but over the cycle i kind of think about it as probably to peter j winter q analyst da davidson co comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 got it thanks a lot curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thanks peter james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc and inflation obviously being a huge factor also operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty from kbw please go ahead curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc good morning chris james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc hey chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning jim quick question on the rate outlook obviously the market expects one next week but if we stay in a higher for longer for the rest of the year and next year you get the forward curve you get a couple of cuts could you talk about how you think your balance sheet will respond in terms of margin performance given all the hedges you put on thanks james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc yeah were pretty neutral right now chris in terms of our interest rate positioning so we dont think it would be an impact regardless of what the fed does we are just the slightest bit to the downside for both an up and down rate scenario i would say the longer the fed holds rates at a high level i do think thats probably puts a little more pressure than less pressure on our projections because i do think you have the potential for a very very slow bleed if theyre kept high for a very extended period of time in terms of betas and deposit flows i dont think its material but i dont think its necessarily helpful to have them elevated for an extended period of time christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and then my followup on capital im interested in your thoughts on what would need to happen to return to a buyback obviously we know the regulatory is an aspect but what is it specifically that would be the moment where you would turn it back on james j herzog a senior executive vice president chief financial officer comerica inc comerica inc cma corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 yeah i would say two things chris one obviously stabilization in the overall banking industry but i think were seeing most of it but i think that were not as an industry out of the woods yet even though things are very stable at comerica so certainly stability there would be good and then obviously once we understand receive and understand the new capital rules as soon as we can get comfortable and we are comfortable right now but well wait and see how comfortable we are once the rules come out once we have some degree of certainty that we can hit our targets based on the new rules i think that would put us in a position to really start thinking about share buyback christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thank you curtis chatman farmer a chairman president chief executive officer comerica inc thank you operator and at this time there are no further questions id like to turn the call back to curt farmer president chairman and chief executive officer curtis chatman
