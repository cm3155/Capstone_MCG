joining me today are chris niles our chief financial officer and pat ahern our chief credit officer associated had an unusual but successful second quarter im proud of how my thousands of colleagues have responded to the challenges we focused on protecting the health of our customers and colleagues while meeting the needs of our customers we met those needs with ppp loans payment deferrals fee waivers and the distribution of stimulus funds we ensured our ability to meet the future needs of our communities and customers with a significant increase in our capital through the sale of associated benefits and risk consulting and a preferred stock issuance weve seen record inflows of deposits and have abundant liquidity with the revenue challenge brought on by near zero interest rates we managed our expenses down while no one could predict the ultimate impact of the covid pandemic on credit we saw some encouraging early signs from our borrowers so lets look at our financial results turning to slide our second quarter gaap earnings were per share including the million gain on sale of associated benefits and risk consulting average loans grew considerably during the quarter largely driven by ppp loans and commercial line draws loan funding along with government stimulus programs and overall increased savings rates led to higher deposit balances as well our loan to deposit ratio was at the end of the quarter without ppp and of our total deposits were made up of low cost deposits while we havent seen significant changes in credit metrics yet our reserve for loan losses increased million during the second quarter and as of june our allowance for loan ratio was or excluding ppp loans the sale of abrc and the issuance of million of preferred stock listed our capital ratios cet1 increased basis points from the first quarter to at a quarter our tangible book value per share also increased moving up from last quarter to average loan balance trends are shown on slide commercial and business lending grew nearly billion driven predominantly by ppp loans and active mortgage warehouse market and increased draws on general commercial lines of credit while we saw unusually high commercial line draws at the end of the first quarter as the second quarter progressed these lines paid down growth in cre was primarily driven by new loans plus continued funding of construction loans on average residential mortgages declined during the second quarter as we continued to sell new production and some portfolio loans to the agencies turning to slide which show end of period loan trends which will highlight second quarter activity we ended the second quarter with billion of loans a net increase of million from the first quarter included in these balances was over billion of outstanding ppp loans this was partially offset by million of paydowns on general commercial lines during the quarter we view the repayment of these lines as a sign our customers have a more optimistic outlook regarding their liquidity than they did at the end of the first quarter as previously mentioned our commercial real estate portfolios continued to grow during the quarter at quarter end we still had nearly billion of unfunded commitments which we expect will continue to fund up over the balance of and into we expect to continue to grow our commercial real estate balances over the course of the year turning to slide lets look at our portfolio composition at the end of the second quarter in the second column we identified our key covid loan exposures which ill highlight on the next page weve also broken out our associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 deferred loans and our nonaccrual loans which remain minimal as the pandemics impact on the economy expanded during the second quarter we responded to our customers needs by underwriting ppp loans and by deferring and modifying certain loans as shown on slide approximately of key covid commercial loan exposures have received a modification or deferral received a ppp loan and received both now lets look at our key covid commercial loan exposures on slide this is an update of the slide we introduced in the first quarter we continue to monitor risks in the loan portfolio the table on slide details our exposures to several categories of commercial loans potentially impacted by covid19 and lower hydrocarbon prices the billion represents less than of outstanding loans at the end of the second quarter making up of our loan book retailers and retail commercial real estate remain our largest area of exposure million of these loans are to retail real estate of which the majority is collateralized by malls shopping centers and nongrocery store anchored strip centers these loans had an average loantovalue ratio of approximately at origination providing a significant cushion for potential deterioration we would highlight amongst our retailoriented reits which are predominantly investment grade credits balances paid down about million from last quarter to about million oil and gas loans also declined million from last quarter and account for of our loan balances in the second quarter we grew reserves further on this portfolio despite the price of oil creeping back up from the first quarter we still remain concerned about the outlook for this industry outside retail and oil and gas our indiscernible exposure is limited hotels and restaurants are our next largest portfolios and each of these categories represent less than of total loans overall we believe our exposure to covidaffected industries remains manageable were seeing positive dynamics and our exposures remain relatively unchanged quarter over quarter now let me comment on our covidrelief efforts for our commercial customers highlighted on slide at june we had just over million of completed commercial loan deferrals the loan deferrals included million of commercial real estate primarily comprising the hotel retail borrowers representing about of the commercial real estate loan book commercial and business lending had million of deferrals or about of that book new commercial loan deferral requests slowed as the quarter progressed and many customers with deferrals ending in june have not asked for additional assistance our consumerrelated covidrelief efforts are highlighted on slide we finished the second quarter with million of consumer loan deferrals or of the total residential and consumer loan book new deferral requests have slowed substantially since the peak in may and have essentially ceased since the latter half of june we also supported many of our customers with waived or refunded fees during the pandemic since implementing our covid19 relief program weve refunded or waived nearly million in fees for consumers and small businesses through june turning to slide early signs are positive as many customers who received payment deferrals are returning to normal payment structures despite having been granted payment waivers about of consumers with completed loan deferrals have made at least one subsequent payment in corporate banking and small business million of loan deferrals ended during june and of those over of customers are expected to resume making payments based on early discussions we expect nearly all of the remaining customers with deferrals in corporate banking and small business to return to making payments commercial real estate had million in loan deferrals expire during june about half of those customers are expected to start making payments again the other half consisting either of hotels or retail properties have requested further extensions of the additional loans on associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 deferral we expect about onethird of these customers to require some form of assistance with the majority being in the hotel sector turning to slide you can see we have built reserves by about million during the second quarter this brings our total allowance to million at the end of june our reserve covers of total loans or excluding ppp loans weve modeled our reserves against the june moodys baseline with our own qualitative overlays additional reserves were set aside for certain industries affected by the covid19 pandemic reserves on covidaffected loans covered of loan balances compared to about for noncovidaffected loans as you can see the bulk of our reserve build is attributed to commercial real estate and oil and gas during the quarter we built up our cre reserves by million reflecting the increased risk profile we see in our retail and hotel portfolios additional reserves were also built up on oil and gas loans which increased by million and now cover of the portfolio turning to slide you can see our credit metrics have drifted up slightly but remain fairly stable potential problem loans increased million driven by general ci and commercial real estate within the key covid commercial loan exposures portfolio nonaccrual loans increased million but are only slightly elevated over the second quarter of million of the increase came from oil and gas with most of the rest coming from commercial real estate our net chargeoffs continue to be almost exclusively in the oil and gas space our oil and gas reserve increased basis points from last quarter the loans in this portfolio are all shared with other banks and our high level of reserves reflects a conservative view of the ultimate outcome for some of these credits as we wind down the business turning to slide average deposits were up nearly billion or over the first quarter most of this growth came from lowcost noninterestbearing checking accounts and savings accounts deposits remain elevated due to ppp loans staying in accounts government stimulus money and generally higher savings rates amongst consumers our lowcost deposit mix continues to improve as these balances made up of overall deposits at the end of the second quarter turning to slide second quarter net interest income was million and yeartodate margin came in at pressure on the margin has been driven by asset yield compression relative to our ability to reduce liability cost as a result of fed cutting rates to near zero total cost of interestbearing deposits dropped to basis points in june as we reduced pricing across the board while second quarter nim declined basis points from the first quarter we expect nim to stabilize in q3 and recover somewhat in q4 total interestbearing liabilities fell to basis points in june driven by the remix of our deposit base and interest rate reductions turning to slide second quarter noninterest income came in at million the mortgage business remains active resulting in an increase of million from the first quarter gross mortgage banking income was million offset by million of msr impairment resulting in million of net mortgage banking income we saw a decline in service charges and deposit account fees during the second quarter of about million driven by less customer and economic activity during q2 we expect activity to recover as we go through the year the gain on sales assets was million during the quarter weve further broken that down on the next slide we closed the sale of abrc on june the sale resulted in million of proceeds and a gaap gain of million after personnel and transaction costs were accounted for the net after tax gain was million and second quarter earnings per share excluding the gain was separately we recognized about million in losses on nonabrcrelated write downs the bulk of this was driven by the writedown from an equity interest in a company related to a restructured oil and gas loan associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 turning to slide we look at our customer activity branch activity has slowly started to come back since april however customers have moved away from using the lobby and continue to use the drivethroughs prior to covid about of transactions took place in the lobby but this has shifted to only as of late customers are also resuming normal spending levels as debit and credit card spend increased from april to june during the covid outbreak weve seen a strong shift to mobile banking even with branch lobbies reopening active mobile application users have increased from january to june this is a positive trend which we feel will provide efficiency opportunities in the long run on slide you can see our continuing downward trend of expenses total noninterest expense was million down million from the first quarter the decrease in expense was spread across several categories personnel expense was down million due to lower benefits fringe and equity plan expenses partially offset by higher commissions occupancy was down million since we were plowing snow business development and advertising were down million as we had less business travel and marketing activity during the quarter as shown on slide our regulatory capital levels remain strong the sale of abrc added basis points to our cet1 ratio and basis points to our tce ratio overall cet1 increased to from in the first quarter our tangible common equity ratio also increased to up from in q1 as i mentioned tangible book value per share is now up from the first quarter we expect capital to continue to build through the remainder of finally on slide we discuss our outlook which includes several updated items we expect our margin to stabilize in q3 and to improve in q4 as we see ppp loans pay down for the full year we expect our margin to come in between and this assumes the pay down of our ppp loans in q4 in early mortgage banking will continue to be elevated in q3 and service charges will start to return to normal levels as covid related fee waivers have expired and consumer activity continues to pick up our quarterly expense run rate is expected to be about million due to million in quarterly expense reductions from the sale of abrc with an outlook for low rates stretching through next year were currently taking a look at our expense base beyond our current guidance and well have more to discuss later this quarter based on our expected view of economic activity within our footprint we anticipate loan loss provisions over the second half of the year to be less than they were in the first half and with that wed be happy to answer your questions associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 question and answer section operator at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi thanks good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp good afternoon philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc just a big picture question first phil you talked about encouraging early trends and then i think another comment is a positive dynamics are you just referring to some of the branch count and consumertype activity that you highlighted or are you talking about something else some more activity and optimism with your commercial book and commercial real estate book philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp well its several things jon so certainly the fact that debit and credit card usage has trended up pretty dramatically here over the last month or so is encouraging but in particular as we look at the 90day deferrals that we gave at the start of all this which were starting to expire in june and will continue to expire this month and next month most of those borrowers who got deferrals are going back to making payments which is very encouraging now were still waiting on the consumers who we gave sixmonth deferrals too but more than a quarter are down even though they had deferrals have been making payments so as we launched into this unusual situation of granting deferrals and waivers we didnt really know what to expect as we got to the back end of that and were certainly gratified that these customers are able to resume their normal payments jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc and on oil and gas i hate to bring it up because we need to talk about it philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp go ahead associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc every quarter but philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp fine jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc it feels like with your reserve levels some of the charges youve taken got to be close to the end of the pane on this in terms of at least impacting the quarterly provision and the quarterly run rate what would need to change worse to make it worse in your mind philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah its a good question if you look at the level of reserves we have in addition to the charge indiscernible the book that remains weve got this portfolio marked at about on the dollar roughly its been interesting this last week as other banks have reported that theres a real divergence of views on whats going to happen here we had one peer bank make the decision to sell the large bulk of their energy portfolio and their reserve secured loans at a very significant discount but not out of sight of where we have our bookmarked and we had another peer bank which has much much lower reserves against a much larger book expressing a lot of optimism as we go through the summer into the fall redetermination period so theres really a wide spectrum of views on how all of this is going to turn out amongst banks and we think its been prudent as weve been marking this book down taking charges reserving substantially against that we should be very well positioned to your point to get through this without a hell of a lot more pain its been bad enough as it is but i think were in a pretty decent spot with the mark that we have today jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then just one last one ill take a shot at it but q3 provision i know its hard to project it but what would be kind of the key drivers to your model assuming the economy is relatively stable in terms of driving the need for more call it economic factor reserve building philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so youve heard us express that based on our assumptions we think that back half of the year provisioning will be less than the first half and thats based upon economic activity continuing as it is today and not having to experience widespread shutdown of economies in our footprint so absent that we feel pretty comfortable with the guidance that we provided jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc i know its tough but all right thanks guys i appreciate it associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah operator our next question comes from the line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co afternoon guys thanks for taking the question i wanted to ask one on the margin you noted so stability which is definitely good and then the expectation for some recovery in the fourth quarter and gathering that thats based on the expectation for forgiveness of the ppp loans or at least that portion of them and the accelerated fee that you got there how much of the notion of recovery in the margin in the fourth quarter is indeed based on that and what would happen to the margin ex any acceleration of ppp fees christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp sure so as we mentioned on slide we do expect ppp to pay down mostly in q4 and then into early and on page of the press release tables we show you the remaining unamortized ppp fee balance so you can track it with us but yeah were saying mostly in q4 so its just half or more and then the balance over the so you can sort of back into the rough number i would note our guidance i think when weve spoken probably back in may we thought it would stay above million but obviously since then the ppp program has been basically extended out right so instead of beginning to realize some of that in the q3 period and then the rest of it in q4 and less in weve had to push that out which is why our margin has trended a little lower from our guidance perspective r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah okay and i guess what im getting at is just sort of the steady state margin do you think its i know we think its stable in the third quarter but presumably outside of ppp would that continue in other words we kind of reached a bottom for the margin christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no i want to say that the bottom is going to be hit in q3 right so on a monthtomonth basis june was a little worse than may and it probably trends a little lower in july and then it starts to bounce up right so that it will find its absolute floor in q3 probably not too far below where we are but pretty close but its going to stabilize and then we expect it to bounce up as we move through the balance of the year and the two factors there are that in q4 the ppp pick up but also were seeing spreads beginning to widen right so we will find our floor probably here in july and itll start moving back higher as we move through the rest of the year on spread widening and the ppp philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and weve got cds which we will continue to roll off and grind lower so therell be some structural reduction of our liability costs just as longer dated deposits mature and get repriced associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp and as we know i think we showed you the average yield for the deposits was basis points and if you look at the slides youll see the number for june was basis points so that the overall interestbearing deposit cost cds and money market and checking continues to grind lower as well which is why again well hit bottom here in july ph it feels like and then start moving higher from there philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp so even without ppp wed be trending about where were hitting now and maybe a little bit up as liabilities re price christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co perfect okay yeah thats what i was getting at so i appreciate that color and then final one just on the mortgage expectation where you note your expectations for elevated mortgage revenues are you guys thinking about that on the basis of the million reported mortgage line or are you sort of thinking about it ex the msr so like up of a base closer to million philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so weve got as we sit here right now still have a billion pipeline of mortgages to work through so thats the highest its been in two years as we sit here today forecasting msr impairment is always difficult because you got to pick a rate on a day r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yeah philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp but one would hope we wouldnt see an impairment like we saw at the end of the second quarter so we would be working off of more the million number than the million number hopefully indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co ph okay perfect associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp now indiscernible r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co i was going to forecast as any in the mortgage business so perfect i appreciate your guys thoughts operator our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good afternoon guys christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp afternoon ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just want to follow up phil in your response to jon around this customer activity talk to us in terms of what it looks like in the markets weve clearly seen an uptick in cases lockdowns in certain parts of the country just when you think about your customers your footprint how do things look today relative to april may and have you seen kind of a negative move in the last few weeks or are you seeing a steady return to normalcy just any color would be helpful philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so rightly or wrongly wisconsin continues to have activity even though our covid infection rates are as high or higher than theyve been just because of as you recall the supreme court threw out the governments ability to control much so economic activity in wisconsin continues and as you know reasonably robust and then minnesota is somewhere in between here and illinois because chicago is still relatively locked down so weve got kind of a wide spectrum there but our forecast is that things will continue as they are across the footprint and perhaps a little more activity down in chicago will lend itself to the assumptions that we made when we said provisioning is going to be less in the back half correct chris christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp ebrahim i might just add if you look at the june unemployment rate data if you look at sort of the coast youll find unfortunately places in the teens but if you look at wisconsin and minnesota youre looking at eight handle unemployment so there is a pretty strong difference between the activity levels on the coast versus the upper midwest associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thats helpful and then i guess just moving to indiscernible ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc go ahead christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp no ph as i said minnesota and wisconsin are the core of our market in exposure and activity and customer basis of course ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood understood and i guess just moving to slide and maybe this is a little bit a few quarters out but i think youre very thoughtful in terms of how youve brought down expenses coming out of the last crisis as you now think about just the change in customer behavior the digital adoption how are you thinking about what this means for further rationalizing the branch footprint the efficiency opportunities down the road philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so as i mentioned we are taking a look at the expense space and applying some of the learnings that weve had from this particularly this workfromhome environment so weve got a number of initiatives underway internally to figure out what work looks like for us as we go through the rest of the covid period and thereafter were still operating from home we dont have people in our corporate offices and then chris brian and i are sitting here and theres probably people when theres normally people in here so we and we dont have any big plans to bring a bunch of people back and the fact of the matter is the company is operating just fine were processing a massive mortgage refi boom and all of that is going into our thinking about how we reduce our expense run rate going forward beyond what weve just guided so well have more information as we get into the quarter as we continue to work on this theres also obviously opportunities to think about how were serving customers the mobile pickup the online pickup the fact that even now that weve opened our branches people now are much more likely to go through the indiscernible come into the lobby presents a lot of different opportunities to think about how the model works going forward and were thinking through all that right now ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc indiscernible my questions operator our next question comes from the line of terry mcevoy with stephens please proceed with your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc hi good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp afternoon terry terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc the cet capital up to following the sale and you said earlier capital should grow in the second half of this year my question is do you have a targeted capital level you used to talk about that in the past and the reason i ask is that if we look at into is it appropriate to think about buyback activities kind of think about putting them into our models if were assuming a return to more normal credit trends philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah its a little bit early to forecast that right now more capital is better given the uncertainties there out there weve said that were not going to buy back shares the balance of the year as we get toward year end and we see what credit looks like and we see where our capital ratios sit well obviously take a look at that but certainly as we sit today having significantly more capital having a larger tangible book value and being awash in liquidity are good things terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc okay and then as a followup question in the first quarter the reserve build was mostly ci and then as i look at the second quarter it was mostly cre so when you think about the back half of this year and the prospects of incremental building do you think itll be heavily weighted towards one or the other or more of an even split philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp my guess is that i dont know exactly how far its going to build to tell you the truth because i think as we get toward the back half of the year i would think some of the oil and gas stuff will resolve itself one way or the other although were well reserved against that so when one thinks that well have a lot of provisioning to do but if i had to guess i dont think outside of oil and gas we have a lot of stress in the commercial space so if were going to build im guessing itll be the retailoriented commercial real estate whether its retailers directly or retail tenants in properties thats probably where we would see it terry mcevoy q analyst stephens inc great thanks phil thanks chris philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp thanks operator our next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please proceed with your question christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question chris maybe go back to the interest income for a second want to ask the margin question a little bit different if we fast forward six months and ppp is behind us how do we think about stability and ultimate growth in core net interest income given outlook for growth a little bit more on the deposit repricing and ph the full effect of loan yields christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so again i would say on the theres a couple of things right so on the loan side we have a margin on most commercial credits as you can see from the tables that is approaching effectively the margin floor so effectively when we hit in q3 here libor is at zero so basically ph where earning is the quoted spread to the customer is the fact that we hit the floor so thats going to hit that floor and the good news is from our contractual structure weve got libor zero floors in there so its not going to go lower and so on the loan side were kind of hitting the floor in july and as we roll over renew and add new were getting a little bit more spread with each of those actions so we assume the spreads will widen a little bit as we move forward as phil pointed out youve got a back book of cds that going to roll and continue to roll down so as we look at our total deposit book again our cost is basis points for the quarter but the cd book was at basis points well thats generally one year and in if you look at our maturity detail that we disclosed in our call reports youll see that so essentially thats going to roll off and come down towards that basis points so thats a real dollar savings that will just come in over the next months and a lot of that in the next months so youre going to see a ph role thats going to be beneficial and well continue to work on other liability levers and that sort of on the core just loan and deposit side and then the ppp we think again will be a positive that pops in q4 now and then into q1 so all of that together says we should see core improving as we move through the year plus ppp philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and then to answer your question on nii chris weve got a significant backlog of cre which will be funded up through this period of time well into next year thats going to help weve got a residential mortgage boom and we can choose whether were going to sell some of that on to the agencies or perhaps portfolio some of that were thinking through that at the moment so we could get some growth there on nii of course its a little harder to forecast right now theres just not a lot of new activity going on people arent out looking to change their banks but assuming the economy continues along this path and slowly improves we would expect to start to see commercial loan growth too as we get farther into the year and into next year so i think with the cost of funds continuing to grind down funding up on cre perhaps resi mortgage and then associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 hopefully on commercial we should start to see some consistent growth in nii as we get later into the year and then into next year christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats very helpful thank you if i could just ask one more on the deferral program can you speak to ph what you might do different in round two if there are round twos in terms of reunderwriting of the borrower that need a little bit more help thanks philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so its going to be very dependent upon the borrower circumstances so for example in the hotel space which is very small for us and weve got a couple of customers who have substantial outside resources and so were hopeful there that well be able to stretch out some of those loans and get through this period of time until they get their occupancy back up the retailer stuff is highly dependent upon how people come back to retail stores but early indications again are pretty good since people are generally getting through their deferral period and starting to pay and again a lot of our loans bulk of our loans have substantial guarantors behind them as well so the initial push with the pandemic was if someone needs a deferral well give it to them but as we come up to that initial days rolling off in june and going forward these are turning into lets have a serious discussion about what it looks like and where weve been indiscernible surprise but would be pleased with the response that weve been getting thats why we have a general sense of optimism at this point about it christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thank you and chris could you just repeat the fees like i was looking quickly through the deck i didnt see it the remaining ppp fees christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah its in the press release table sorry chris i wasnt clear its on page and its in the middle of the page and it says payment protection program fees net and that was million at the end of june that have not yet been amortized in christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right awesome thank you philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah operator our final question comes from the line of michael young with suntrust please proceed with your question associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey thanks for taking the question wanted to maybe just follow up on the commercial construction book it looks like theres about a reserve there is that just an abundance of caution or should we read that to mean that whats in that construction book is maybe more in a higher risk segment maybe retail or hotel et cetera christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp look i think our cecl methodology borrowed heavily from our experiences in the last downturn and over time so construction loans have during downturns ph when where people have taken larger hits in the past and our cecl methodology necessarily sort of looks at the last couple of recessions and factors therein so thats partly the issue and i think it was high on day one as you can see with one of the larger buckets where we increased our reserves on day one and it continues high because in both associated banks own experience and the industrys experience thats where when things go construction projects stop theres usually pain for all involved and if you the environment shifts on you as people are completing projects the amount of time they may sit unutilized or underutilized causes sometimes more challenges than other projects that are already occupied that are completed so thats just good practice to have a little more reserves in that bucket philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp and michael to just give you a little color on whats in there of loan production this year which is mostly funding up this stuff is in either industrial or multifamily very very little in the retail space which of course would be the riskiest space michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thats helpful and maybe just a followup on the capital commentary chris you made the comment that you expect capital to continue to build i guess im just trying to level set that against potential increases in non performing assets as we move forward through the crisis at what point will do you think the risk weightings on those will increase and maybe offset some of the capital build thats occurring naturally christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah so i think theres a couple of things to keep in mind so we are assuming that a good portion of the ppp balances come off so thats billion and even theres only half of it that comes off and were certainly thinking most of it does by the end of the year that means our tangible assets are going to come down by more than billion of that top which means the tangible common equity indiscernible will just naturally drift higher in addition as phil mentioned were looking at lending that likely is looking reasonable to add to volumes before the end of the year so again therell probably be a slight positive but not enough to offset the more than billion of ppp that will come off so well have a net improvement just because the balance sheet effectively shrinks that will have less of an impact on the riskweighted assets because what will be adding will be real commercial cre riskweighted stuff and whats coming off as a zero riskweighted stuff but we expect to earn our dividend and more over the course of the back half of the year and so therefore well have capital accretion and net balance sheet shrinkage which will contribute to higher capital ratios as we move forward associated banccorp asb corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay perfect and one last just clarification just on the effective tax rate for the year this quarter so that gets me to a pretty low tax rate in the back half of the year i just want to make sure i was thinking about that correctly indiscernible christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president associated banccorp yeah and we guided that we think that yeah weve guided we think its going to be less than its kind of a quirk of the way you need to account for the sale so we recognized the sale this quarter so we have to sort of fully tax it at the full marginal rate and because some of the abrc acquisitions in the past were taxfree acquisitions we didnt have tax basis in them the way we have on other deals so the tax rate on that deal was a little bit higher than normal but as we move through the course of the year you have to average out to the normalized full year tax rate and so itll just naturally come down over the subsequent quarters and youll see the overall we expect to be something less than michael young q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thanks thats all for me operator we do have one final question coming from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good afternoon this is actually timur braziler filling in for jared two quick questions for me one on the cre growth this quarter i guess where are you seeing the incremental demand for cre now and i guess is that are those industries where youre seeing demand today is at kind of where youre expecting growth to come in for the rest of the year as well philip b flynn a president chief executive officer director associated banccorp yeah so the growth you are seeing is generally construction loans funding up and construction loans that have completed stabilized and flipped over into the investor bucket so this is stuff that was mostly originated a year ago there isnt a lot of new origination going on anywhere as you would expect and the bulk of it is as i told michael just a minute ago was is in the industrial and multifamily space timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay got it and then just as you look at the second round of deferral requests will you be asking the borrower for something in exchange for that second round of deferrals whether its guarantee or increased collateral or anything
