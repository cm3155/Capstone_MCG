in a listenonly mode therell be some opening remarks followed by a questionandanswer session operator instructions i must advise you that this conference is being recorded today i would now like to turn the conference over to your speaker today ewen stevenson please go ahead sir ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you and good morning or afternoon all its ewen here the group chief financial officer im joined today by iain mackinnon group treasurer and greg case head of fixed income investor relations given covid19 were actually all in separate locations so please bear with us if we talk over each other during qa theres a fixed income specific slide deck thats available on our investor relation website we dont plan to speak to those slides in our introductory comments and well try to keep our comments brief as i know a bunch of you will have already listened to various things including our equity call this morning uk time ill quickly run through what weve announced today then ill hand over to iain for more detail on capital and funding before we open up for your qa today as youre aware we announced our fullyear results together with a business update with a refreshed strategy and some new financial targets including a new dividend policy for the fullyear results hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 i would describe them as a solid set of results particularly against the backdrop of covid19 and now ultralow interest rate environment adjusted pretax profits of billion reported pretax profits of billion our core capital base strengthened nicely with a yearend core tier of thats up basis points in the fourth quarter and basis points over the full year and deposits grew over billion in the year on a constant currency basis a growth rate of relative to the plan that we announced in february last year the threeyear target to achieve billion of gross riskweighted assets sales in targeted areas we delivered over half of that in the first year of the program that were very pleased about on operating costs we reduced those by billion or in and we committed today to achieve a further billion of savings by relative to our previous target however the impact of the ultralow rate environment means that we no longer expect to hit our to return on tangible equity target in weve reset that target to at least over the medium term which weve described as three to four years and thats premised on a similar rate environment to what we see in the markets today underpinning this is a much stronger set of growth aspirations for us and asia both in wealth and in the wholesale banking with a target of increasing our capital allocated to asia from currently to over over the coming years on the fourth quarter again a decent set of results reported pretax profits of billion adjusted revenues were down on last years fourth quarter which was mainly driven by the progressive impact of ultralow interest rates operating expenses were up ex the bank levy but this was mainly due to an increase in the variable pay accrual in the quarter with the variable pay call for the full year down on expected credit losses were billion in the quarter bringing total expected credit losses for the full year to billion and thats at the lower end of the targeted billion to billion range that we announced earlier in the year while we do remain cautious on the outlook for credit for we still expect the ecl charge to be lower than with no update to the guidance that we gave on this at the third quarter which was broadly a range of basis points to basis points for the full year and by we expect ecl to have fallen materially from the basispoint charge we had last year towards or even below the lower end of our 30basispoint to 40basispoint normalized range and with that ill pass over to iain iain mackinnon group treasurer hsbc holdings plc thanks ewen hi everyone iain mackinnon here thanks for dialing in ill just continue with indiscernible despite the weak macroenvironment the balance sheet metrics continued to show strength our cet1 ratio was up basis points in the fourth quarter to the per share dividend announced today has impacted the ratio by around basis points during customer deposits grew by over billion our loan balances remained broadly flat resulting in a loantodeposit ratio of and by percentage points since the start of the year the group remains very hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 liquid with gross highquality liquid assets of over billion to hand despite this our consolidated liquidity coverage ratio was down percentage points at versus largely reflecting technical consolidation adjustments in the calculation of the consolidation rather than an increase in liquidity risk note that this may decline further as we implement further regulatory adjustments the decline will have no material implications for the groups overall liquidity risk management on issuance im pleased with what we achieved in during the year we took a lot of action to reduce our refinancing risk in and while delivering negative net issuance by tendering for nearly billion of mrel in weve reduced this years refinancing requirements from billion to less than billion and next years from billion to less than billion looking out over this year we expect to issue around billion of mrel against maturities and calls of nearly billion the difference is the fact that in this year it marks the final year of material increases in the amount of senior holdco debt needed to meet regulatory requirements from onwards we expect the balance of senior holdco debt to follow the progression of the groups rwas for at1 we broadly expect to refinance our instruments that we choose to redeem of where they lose capital eligibility this is in line with what we did in where we redeemed nearly billion worth of bonds and issued sic billion in return for tier we have no plans to issue in on ibor our guiding principle is to work with bondholders to transition where we can and we look forward to bringing forward transition offerings this year with that ill hand back to ewen ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks iain look before we open up qa i did want to take this opportunity with all of you on the call actually to say many thanks to iain its actually his last fixed income call for us as group treasurer iains retiring over the next month or so after many years with us both in tax and treasury on the next of these calls well have our new group treasurer hell be known to a number of you carlo pellerani he was the recent group treasurer of ubs carlo starts on monday ph so be with us with that if we could now open up for some questions hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions your first question comes from paul fenner société générale please go ahead your line is open paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk hi good afternoon gentlemen and ewen congratulations and best of luck for the future ive really just got i guess two connected questions on stage and forgive me if this came up this morning i may have missed it but obviously stage exposures ticked up again in the fourth quarter not by much but by some things it basically doubled during the year but i think im right in saying that your stage elements that is past due has not changed at all during the year so i was just trying to understand whats happening there between the relationship between stage that is still paying and those that are not paying is there a connection and if there is what is it and what might we expect from stage balances during the course of and leading on to my next question where do you see for stage i hear what youre saying about cost of risk but if we think about an npl ratio a stage ratio do you think it peaks in and how far from the peak are we right now thank you sorry about the longwinded question richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc its richard oconnor here ill start and greg if you may be chip in look stage primarily due to the forward economic guidance and those calculations ph and indeed overlays and obviously when we did the yearend then clearly in the last few weeks maybe the economic outlook improved a little bit due to the vaccines but clearly there is still some deterioration for example in the uk and youre right to say that weve had a remarkably low level of default throughout the year weve had some weve obviously had some hits in terms of stage look were obviously not going to get drawn too much on specific forecasts but clearly stage defaults in some sense are lagging indicator and certainly as government schemes mature this year you may see ph the companys stage from some of those elements hopefully not and then if forward economic guidance improves during the year then you may see them moving back from stage to stage so i think theres a lot of moving parts there but broadly as you heard from ewen today our overall expectation from the charts this year remains in the basis points to basis points of loans and thats been unchanged since the q3 stage so youve seen the stabilization in the last few months and indeed some better macro trends in the last few weeks greg anything to add to that greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah just on the stage sides its worth noting that about a quarter of our corporate loans in stage right now were within the risk grades that we would classify as effective investment grade and obviously with those type of exposures that are relatively low pds it doesnt take a particularly big shift for the pd to degrade to such an hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 extent that it falls into stage and then obviously while there have been a number of the significant number of downgrades across the portfolio its worth noting that the technical difficulty and that has been reflected in the numbers somewhat paul fennerleitão q analyst société générale sa uk thank you operator thank you your next question comes from the line of lee street from citigroup please go ahead your line is open lee street q analyst citigroup hello good afternoon ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi lee lee street q analyst citigroup thanks for doing the call so three questions for me firstly on stage as well now in the fixed income slide that youve got that chart on page that shows the strong or good quality credit obviously thats gone from of the book down to over the year but stage loans have increased by sort of bigger proportion from to so is it right to compare those things together and i suppose my question is given the moving stage loans shouldnt that have seen a sort of greater reduction in the stronger good quality credit being the first one secondly indiscernible if you sell the french retail operations and you sell the us retail operations would that be sufficient to alter your funding plans it helped us in terms of holding company senior debt for the year given the reduction in riskweighted assets that might entail and finally on the bank of england legacy capital review you referred to determining whether any action is required in terms of making that determination is it a question of how you interpret the capital requirements regulation or is it a question of materiality or how much of the debt indiscernible debt you have outstanding thatd be my three questions thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah richard indiscernible maybe greg can take the first richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc not much to write to stage look youre right to say that clearly the strong oil good has gone down in the air as weve shown in our chart there is another chart in the deck sorry weve got a lot of graphs here which showed actually more on indiscernible migration that there was a bit more of a stabilization across the grades in q4 albeit clearly we still we had some stage hits in q4 as well hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 so look the other thing i would say is clearly youre right to point out the stage movements for us what i would say is we do use more scenarios than other banks particularly in europe so sometimes you just need to go through all our work and that can obviously give you a slightly different picture to other banks who may use slightly fewer or different scenarios in their ifrs9 modeling ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on that question on french and us retail and without confirming whether or not we will sell them but if we were to sell them i dont think that would change our issuance plans theyre not big enough to have any material impact and greg do you want to take the third question on the legacy capital instruments greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah of course and so on the legacy piece the wording we used in that slide was effectively to mirror the wording that the dear cfo letter used its not necessarily pointing toward the fact that we think that there may be any actions to take at this stage i think its too early to say but indiscernible peers over the last week or so were busy looking over the various bonds that we have as you know weve got a relatively small amount of bonds to grandfather into and were going to share the analysis with the pra and have a discussion from then on lee street q analyst citigroup all right and is it interpretation of the rules or materiality or is it both greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc i think thats still for discussion lee street q analyst citigroup all right all right thanks very much ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thank you richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc thanks operator thank you and your next question comes from daniel david from autonomous please go ahead your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi dan dan david q analyst autonomous research llp good afternoon hi good afternoon and thanks for the call just a quick one hopefully on legacy capital i just wanted to touch upon your opco tier so although they might not cause an infection risk i suppose they could be deemed an impediment to resolution so my question is do you expect the pra to consider other factors such as retail holding or nonresolution entity impediments as part of the process which is going on here and secondly just on esg so noting your issuance in the past is there a percentage of your issuance time this year that we should think of to be targeted in green format and more broadly the ec taxonomy is kind of a positive step i guess to improve esg disclosure so can you comment on how this factors into the broader esg strategy at hsbc thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc all right greg you start off on the legacy question and then indiscernible on the esg question greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah sure of course so on the opco tier i think again its still a discussion with the pra over the course of this year and be it either as part of the dear cfo letter and what comes out of that during the course of the next month or so but also of course a part of the resolution assessment framework that obviously was pushed back by months but of course is very much an agenda item for us for this year at this stage as i said theres not a huge amount to say on the subject obviously from an impediment to resolution perspective we can have a view on that and we can take that to the pra and have a discussion but i think its going to have to be a twosided discussion and we wouldnt want to prejudge that just a touch on green bonds i think we have as you can imagine a portfolio of green assets that we can put together things like green bonds and in recent years weve been prioritizing some client business that is a bit backed by green collateral so we have a number of client facilities like green cd program we have green structured notes but for this year i think we would very much like to come to market with a benchmark green deal it has been a year or so since we last been to the market dan david q analyst autonomous research llp great and just on the ec sic eu taxonomy i guess many ph market business is quite a big step forward in terms of improving disclosure so i was just wondering more broadly if youre observing it and kind of if youre factoring into kind of the way youre progressing as a esgaligned bank richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 i mean ill kick off here ph but not understand the question but clearly as an esg bank were looking at a variety of frameworks ph such as the and the one which were looking in particularly is the wef framework world economic forum clearly weve been a leader in tcfd disclosure and weve made substantial disclosures today in esg report in the tcfd report and the new esg data pack so clearly we are working hard with all the relevant providers but i think the one where were moving forward for more generally is the disclosures is the wef framework im not sure that answers the question but thats how were currently thinking about it dan david q analyst autonomous research llp okay thank you very much ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc thanks operator thank you and your next question comes from ph alvaro rios de alba from morgan stanley please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc afternoon q thank you very much for taking my call i have three questions the first question is regarding discos should we think differently about the security that ph isnt from the hong kong subsidiary as the lcr from this entity is quite high and the security will not be mreleligible after january my second question is a more broader question is regarding any impact because of the movement to hong kong in terms of regulatory environment and my third question is regarding ratings if you guys have any comments or thoughts about moodys or fitch downgrades ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah greg do you want to take the first and third and then ill pick up the second one greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah of course of course so yes i think to an extent you should think about the hong kong and the uk discos separately and that they are issued by two different banks with different regulatory regimes and obviously as you note different liquidity positions now im not saying that were necessarily going to look at them differently or that one is more likely to be looked at as someone take out in the future or not but i think its worth bearing in mind that they are under two very different regulatory regimes and so thats important to note hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 on the rating side of things i think were broadly comfortable with the ratings that we have obviously wed always like them to be higher theres not really much we can add beyond i think what the various rating agencies have said publicly on the subject at this stage and obviously if you want to engage with them directly you can feel free but were not going to put words in their mouth ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah on the regulatory point yeah you may need to clarify the question but i mean theres nothing behind what weve announced today or no comments around considering moving some members of his senior management team to hong kong thats driven at all by regulation yeah we are very much domiciled here in the uk noel and i for the foreseeable future are based here in the uk and theres nothing in todays announcement thats driven by either a push factor from the pra or a pull factor from the hkma q okay thats great thank you very much operator thank you operator instructions your next question comes from tom jenkins from jefferies please go ahead your line is open ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi tom tom jenkins q managing director jefferies thank you hey hello thank you very much hello everybody im going to throw greg under the bus one more time on something we discussed but its an easy one i hope and then ive got a couple of questions on the asset sales if i may firstly on the legacies if you would let me youre basically homeschooling several impatient and petulant traders and then the 31st of march has become quite a big date in the calendar for the pra review submissions what sort of communication do you think probably asking this a bit early but do you have any plans to communicate to the market what your submissions either looks like or rough ideas or are you going to wait until sort of latter discussions with the pra are concluded and if thats the case what sort of timeframe best guess and i promise im not going to hold you to have a best guess which you put on that before as market communique and then secondly the asset sales really when im looking at the us im just wondering what package youre looking to sell is it just hsbc bank usa na the bulk of the retail business is it the intermediate holdco that sits above the hsbc usa inc as a package or are you pretty much open to just selling parcels of loans if thats all you can get a bid for and i guess the same thing goes for france really maybe looking more at the liability side if seeing as i understand already separated retail from commercial lending to a larger extent there is it your anticipation at this hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 stage that the package youre looking to sell in france would include ccf bonds or not would be my questions thank you ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah so greg you can pick up the disco question and i can pick up the ma questions greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah of course look and generally speaking across the piece obviously the march deadline is the deadline for us to submit our initial analyses and thoughts how long that conversation goes on and very very hard for us to guide on i think it will be a function of many things and obviously many different priorities so im afraid im going to have to disappoint you there tom and not give you again specifics but look on the market disclosure and things like that look it really depends on whether or not theres anything to tell you and thats kind of the first point and if there is something to tell you then of course a very conscious that there may be pricesensitive information in the mix here and if we need to make a disclosure well make a disclosure but were not kind of planning at this stage like a wholesale disclosure piece to be quite honest with you its more around if we do become party to anything well say something tom jenkins q managing director jefferies right okay i figured as much just wanted to check ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc yeah and look im obviously somewhat constraint telling you what i can say about the ma processes but i think if ma processes do eventuate there will be parts france wont include the bonds and the us wouldnt be a legal entity tom jenkins q managing director jefferies it would not be a legal entity so i was just cracking up a bit did you say richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc if that indiscernible were to happen tom jenkins q managing director jefferies yeah sure sure okay interesting thank you very much operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of robert smalley with ubs please go ahead your line is open hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc hi thanks very much for taking my questions and good luck iain and greg thanks very much for the package that you send every quarter its very helpful two topics one and i guess theyre both kind of following on from tom in the call earlier this morning it was the idea of trapped capital in the us was brought up how much capital is trapped in the us how would you plan on getting it out are there tax implications to that and whats changed because i imagine that you wanted to get some of this out for a while and i guess secondly if you could follow up on the comment you just made on legal entity nonlegal entity the call broke up and im not really sure what you were referring to thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc well on the second question i think the question was are we contemplating selling a legal entity in the us and the answer is no robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc okay ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc on trapped capital this has been an issue that has persisted for a number of years and today order of magnitude probably something in the order of about billion of capital you dont be it at the group level because effectively we take on additional double leverage what wed like to do is pay the capital out and pay the double leverage down yeah we think itll be a three fouryear journey for us of restructuring the us business and getting the regulators comfortable that weve got a sustainably profitable business in the us and then through several seek our cycles effectively getting approval to pay that capital up to the group greg case a head of fixed income investor relations hsbc holdings plc and theres no taxable indiscernible robert smalley q analyst ubs securities llc okay makes sense thank you operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of james hyde from pgim please go ahead your line is open james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd hi ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 hi james james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd hi ewen hi everyone yeah my question is slightly philosophical one about where youre going especially for us as for the investment as a developed market investment portfolio that my company runs now tangible equity invested in asia goes to why stop at given the roe differential is that the sort of stock that then makes you have to revisit domicile or is this to do with balance or rating agencies i just want to understand the thinking of any such benchmark thats the first question ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc well i guess that was driven by a realistic medium to longerterm target of shifting of capital when you do the math on it that is a fairly material reallocation of capital from west to east over that period or growth indiscernible yeah i wouldnt fixate on but we are a global business today and a lot of the value in asia is driven by that global connectivity out of customers in the us and europe and the uk and therefore there will always i think for the foreseeable future be material amounts of capital invested outside of asia to support and ph self reinforcing with the asian business richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc and jim the timeframe here was three four five years depending on which particular target and so clearly as we go through that time period well roll forward our plans to suit on the opportunities which you see at that particular time so its very much meant to be a pathway for the next few years james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd thanks ewen thanks richard just another question on these proposals regarding esg that are more particularly climate concerns that youre going to put to the agm i just want to understand can you give us some color on whats going to change is it going to be a formal refusal to do any more coal anywhere or any other fossil fuels just want to understand what would satisfy the some of the shareholders esg shareholders that are being vocal richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc well ill take that look weve obviously received the shareaction resolution and the resolution which was co filed by other institutional and retail shareholders we are in positive discussions with that group and clearly well have to put out our agm notice some time towards the end of march and in any event there will be a climate resolution filed but clearly as you saw with barclays last year there were actually two resolutions filed but ultimately a number of investors would prefer there was just one resolution filed so were still in that process jim so im afraid we cant be too specific but as the ceo noel quinn said today clearly there will be an element of a the commitment to end the finance of coal during a certain period of time clearly we will also be making greater disclosures in terms of sectors and sector pathways towards the net zero goal for but thats still very much work in progress and we can obviously update you as and when or before we file the agm notice in a few weeks time hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 james leonard hyde q analyst pgim ltd great thank you very much richard richard oconnor a headglobal investor relations hsbc holdings plc yeah operator thank you we will now take our final question and your final question and your final question for today comes from the line of ph dan crew from goldman sachs please go ahead your line is open q hi there ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc hi q thanks for the call just a quick one my line broke up a little earlier so its more of a clarification on issuance in at1 i assume that the refinancing includes both the billion in at1 coming and then the billion in legacy tier and then a kind of a followon from that if the pra asks you to remove some of the opco debt ph thats going to your tier would that change your issuance there and then im sure this was covered in the call earlier but i had to drop off but just trying to tie a few numbers on your rwas i dont think im missing something in terms of increases for this year so it just looks like you simply reached next year with pretty significant excess capital i guess thats ph hence the talk of buybacks or is there something this year that i should take note of thanks ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc greg or iain do you want to take the first part of that question and ill pick up on rwas iain mackinnon a group treasurer hsbc holdings plc yeah so indiscernible on the at1 what we said was that we would continue with the pattern of replacing when appropriate i dont really think we want to go beyond that and on the tier were not seeing any particularly vigorous action from the pra beyond the conversations were having with them on the legacy instruments so i dont think there would be anything happening this year that would force us to change the issuance plans i think thats what we are hsbc holdings plc hsbc corrected transcript q4 earnings call fixed income 23feb2021 ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc then on rwas on the equity call this morning i mean firstly we havent guided to capital ratios at the end of ph q1 what i did say was the following firstly we are probably more ph bullish than consensus on loan growth as you would expect us to be but we are targeting midsingledigit loan growth over the next couple of years we have about billion of rwa uplift and regulatory process this year and probably a combined billion to billion over the period through weve got the rwa rundown program thats still ongoing we did in the first year weve got another to do this year we think and the remainder the year after and then youll have your own views on credit rating migration so there could be a degree of that this year for conservative reasons well assume that there is until there isnt so yeah i think youre right that some of the equity analysts had assumed that that led to significant capital surpluses i did say this morning to the analysts sellside that we werent planning any buybacks on top of dividends for this year q okay perfect but theres nothing beyond that that i should be taking it i mean thats all stuff i assumed there is nothing coming out of the wood right ewen james stevenson a group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc no no q okay perfect thank you very much ewen james stevenson group chief financial officer director hsbc holdings plc okay well look thanks everyone for joining the call today if youve got any followup questions please follow up with greg case hes been on the call and your normal investor relations channels but greg we appreciate you taking the time to join the call today thank you operator thank you that does conclude our conference for today thank you for
