and total revenue generation successful execution against both sales effectiveness and client retention goals that is driving growth and business momentum as well as announcing the proposed

progress weve made during with both of our business segments performing strongly as weve advanced towards achieving our medium term financial targets state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 within the investment servicing business we enhanced our enhanced core strategy combined with our strategic pivot to an enterprise outsource solutions provider across the front middle and back office manifested itself to the stronger business momentum and revenue growth in which you can see along the top of the slide as we successfully diversify and broaden our wins by region and client segment we achieved record auca servicing wins of trillion in and continue to deploy our enterprise outsourcing capabilities underpinned by our integrated fronttoback alpha platform we announced nine additional alpha wins in with alpha clients now live at yearend we also continued to enhance our product capabilities in launching alpha for private markets as well as our new state street digital division at global advisors we executed well against our longterm strategy which contributed to a number of records for that business in including revenues assets under management and etf inflows importantly global advisors full year pretax margin expanded by over six percentage points in to a record deepening the value of our investment management franchise to state streets results our spider business performed particularly well in gaining us etf flow market share including low cost in active in addition to the record inflows i just mentioned as i look back at i am particularly pleased with our client impact improvement in our sales effectiveness and heightened focus on client satisfaction service quality and retention across our businesses together with a favorable equity market backdrop helped to drive a stronger revenue performance notably full year servicing and management fees each reached our highest level on record in with total fee revenue increasing by yearonyear and exceeding billion for the first time while we delivered a strong revenue performance in expense management remained a key focus for us with companywide productivity and engineering efforts achieving approximately million of gross expense savings because of our strong revenue and sales performance in and the healthy pipeline in front of us these efficiency savings allowed us to fund investments in our talent technology and business in the fourth quarter to drive future growth even with this increased investment total expenses were well contained relative to revenue growth helping to drive a significant improvement in a number of key financial metrics that you can see on the bottom of the slide despite record low interest rates and excluding notable items we delivered meaningful full year pretax margin expansion positive fee and total operating leverage and eps growth in and we expect to do this again in turning to slide i will briefly touch on our fourth quarter highlights before eric takes you through the quarter in more detail eps increased yearoveryear or excluding notable items this strong yearover year earnings growth was driven by solid total fee revenue growth which more than offset interest rate headwinds on nii leading to a good fourth quarter total revenue performance we delivered basis points of total positive operating leverage in the fourth quarter excluding notable items importantly we again expanded state streets pretax margin which increased by more than one percentage point relative to the year ago period to in the fourth quarter excluding notable items the solid business momentum that we saw during continued into the fourth quarter which you can see in the middle of this slide auca increased to a record trillion at quarter end and new asset servicing wins state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 amounted to billion for the quarter auca won but yet to be installed was trillion at quarter end while charles rivers annual recurring revenue in the fourth quarter increased yearoveryear to million at global advisors assets under management totaled trillion at quarter end management fees increased to a record million in the fourth quarter benefiting from higher yearonyear average equity market levels and record inflows to our etf franchise turning to our balance sheet at the bottom of the slide capital return remains a key part of our mediumterm targets and we recognize its importance to our shareholders as you know we suspended common share repurchases in q3 in connection with our intended purchase of brown brothers harriman investor services we currently expect to reinstate common share repurchases during the second quarter of this year in line with our previous expectations to conclude my opening remarks i am pleased with the strategic operational and financial progress we demonstrated in we meaningfully improved our full year financial performance across a number of key metrics creating value for our shareholders and advancing us towards our mediumterm financial targets looking ahead i have four core strategic objectives for which are aimed at helping us achieve our vision for the organization and position the business for future success first is to continue to grow revenue by executing on a number of key strategic priorities this year including completion of our pivot to an enterprise outsourcer underpinned by our alpha platform buildout continuing to develop key product offerings and capabilities particularly private markets and further strengthening sales in client management capabilities and processes second the successful integration of bbh investor services is a key priority the proposed acquisition is a financially compelling use of capital and once closed it will strengthen our market leadership by creating the worlds largest custodian expand and deepen our international reach further propel our alpha strategy and add strong talent that will supplement our focus on client and service excellence and expertise third as we did in we must continue to transform the way we work by driving increased productivity and efficiency throughout our organization we are developing and implementing a simplified scalable configurable endtoend operating model this more scalable model will allow us to deliver increased client quality operational capacity speed and resilience fourth we must continue to build an even higherperforming organization our performance culture and improved employee experience will enable us to sustain a more diverse engaged and empowered team with the experience capabilities and desired behaviors required for future growth these four goals reflect our relentless focus on performance and achieving our mediumterm financial targets i have confidence that we will be able to meet our strategic and client goals while also delivering positive fee and total operating leverage and expanding our pretax margin each year through our mediumterm horizon aided by the strong momentum we are seeing across our businesses and with that let me turn it over to eric to take you through the quarter in more detail eric w aboaf chief financial officer state street corp thank you ron and good morning everyone before i begin my review of our fourth quarter and full year results let me briefly discuss some of the notable items we recognized in the quarter outlined on slide first we state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 recognized acquisition and restructuring costs most of which were related to crd and whose integration is now complete second we recognized the net repositioning release of million which consists of occupancy cost of million as we continue to reduce our footprint and a release of previously accrued compensation costs worth million as attrition picked up and we redeployed staff more effectively than anticipated third we saw an opportunity to correct an imbalance in the competitiveness of our compensation program by accelerating expenses associated with certain deferred cash incentive awards the impact of the acceleration increased expenses by million in this quarter this change will allow us to realign the mix of immediate versus deferred cash in our incentive compensation awards in future periods which will make our pay practice competitive and enable us to better attract talent in an increasingly tight talent market our mix of deferred equity remains unchanged finally youll see that in the fourth quarter also benefited from a million gain on sale of legacy liborbased securities previously classified as held to maturity this sale and this quarters higherthanusual tax benefit helped to offset some of the deferred compensation expense acceleration i just mentioned turning to slide ill begin my review of both fourth quarter and full year results as you can see on the top left of the slide we finished the fourth quarter with strong revenue growth compared to fee revenue increased primarily reflecting strong growth in servicing fees management fees and crd revenues only partially offset by lower fx trading services expenses were wellmanaged delivering positive total operating leverage notwithstanding the significant nii headwind pretax margin is up more than percentage point yearonyear and roe is up almost percentage points on the rightside of the slide we show our full year revenue performance as ron highlighted earlier was a record year for us for fee revenues and despite historically low interest rates in im quite pleased that for the full year we still delivered positive operating leverage of more than percentage point improvement in pretax margin and eps growth in the doubledigits turning to slide youll see our investment services balance growth remained strong as we saw record auca at the end of the fourth quarter of trillion a yearonyear increase of largely driven by higher market levels client flows and net new business quarteronquarter auca growth was muted as markets were pretty mixed at global advisors aum at yearend increased yearonyear and quarteronquarter to a record trillion the yearonyear and sequential quarter increases were both primarily driven by higher market levels coupled with net inflows of note we reported strong net inflows during the fourth quarter of almost billion our global spdr etf business recorded the highest ever quarter driven by strong us flows pushing total net etf inflows to billion for the full year turning to slide you can see another quarter of good business momentum fourth quarter servicing fees increased yearonyear the increase reflects higher average equity market levels client activity inflows and positive net new business again these items were only partially offset by normal pricing headwinds and about a full point of currency translation on a sequential basis i would remind you that while the sp was up on average international markets were down so markets were relatively neutral servicing fees were down primarily due to client activity and adjustments and the impact on appreciating us dollar partially offset by another quarter of positive net new business state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 auca wins totaled a solid billion in the fourth quarter which gets us to a record trillion new wins across client segments and regions for the full year and our pipeline remains strong at quarter end auca won but yet to be installed amounted to trillion with alpha representing a nice proportion which reflects the unique value proposition and our competitive strength as the only fronttoback offering from a single provider turning to slide fourth quarter management fees reached a record million up yearonyear and up quarteronquarter resulting in an investment management pretax margin of for fourth quarter the yearonyear management fee results primarily benefited from higher average equity market levels and strong etf inflows these yearonyear benefits were only partially offset by previously reported client asset reallocation and money market fee waivers of million in the quarter the quarteronquarter results were largely driven by a slight uptick in equity market daily averages as you can see on the bottom right of the slide our franchise remains well positioned as evidenced by both strong quarterly momentum and fullyear results we are particularly pleased with the actions that weve previously taken over the years in our longterm institutional and etf franchises delivered growth over the course of regarding management fee money market waivers we currently expect that they will come in at approximately million less in the first quarter of based on an anticipated march fed rate hike which will be included in our outlook turning to slide let me discuss the other important fee revenue lines in more detail fx trading services was down yearonyear reflecting lower fx volatility and lower volumes in our standing instruction business on a sequential basis fx revenue increased primarily driven by higher fx volatility partially offset by lower volumes moving to securities finance fourth quarter fees increased yearonyear mainly reflecting higher client securities loan balances and new business wins and enhanced custody on a sequential basis fees were down quarteronquarter mainly as a result of lower agency balances finally fourth quarter software and processing fees were down yearonyear and lower quarteronquarter largely driven by lower market related adjustments partially offset by continued growth in crd which ill turn to next moving to slide id like to highlight our crd and alpha performance we delivered strong standalone crd results in the quarter with yearonyear revenue growth of fullyear standalone revenue growth was yearonyear which makes this the second year in a row where we grew the business revenue in the doubledigit range the more durable saas and professional services revenues continue to grow nicely as we onboarded and converted more clients to the cloud saas clients now represent nearly half of our crd client base in addition we achieved record new bookings of million for full year with a healthy revenue backlog of million at quarter end demonstrating the continued business momentum as we head into supported by the state street alpha value proposition turning to alpha on the bottom right of the slide fullyear was a busy year as we announced nine new alpha mandates and nearly doubled the amount of wins weve achieved since inception at yearend we have total live alpha clients weve also been busy enhancing our alpha product offering this year in addition to launching alpha for private markets and our acquisition of mercatus in the third quarter we also went live with our alpha data platform in the fourth quarter which is our cloudnative platform providing enterprise data management and access to all the data and analytics that our clients use to perform their daily endtoend investment processes state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 turning to slide fourth quarter nii was down yearonyear mainly driven by the impact of a low interest rates on the investment portfolio yields partially offset by another quarter of higher loan balances as well as growth in deposits and the investment portfolio relative to the third quarter nii came in lower primarily as a result of the expected normalization of premium amortization as you may recall third quarter included an episodic benefit worth about million which we previously noted wasnt expected to repeat in the fourth quarter we do however see continued premium amortization slowing we like many of you are excited about the rise weve seen in longend rates this year however short rates have been flat so far and its really the prospect of fed action in the march timeframe which would have a significant benefit on nii on the right of the slide we show our average balance sheet during the fourth quarter average assets increased quarteronquarter primarily driven by higher deposit levels we consciously allowed average deposits to float up this past quarter which we then expect to monetize in a period of rising interest rates turning to slide fourth quarter expenses excluding notable items were up yearonyear as we previously decided to increase incentive compensation to reflect strong yearonyear performance and pulled forward some investments in the business at the end of the year however we also experienced some higherthanexpected episodic expenses medical costs were higher as we saw a rampup in yearend claims we saw some elevated it vendor costs and we realized higher marketing spend associated with ga volumes compared to on a line item basis excluding notable items compensation and employee benefits was up driven by higher incentive compensation and medical costs partially offset by lower head count and salaries notably our continued focus on digitization automation as well as resource discipline have helped us reduce our head count this year by percentage points even as we onboarded larger deals and processed more transaction volume information systems and communications were up due to continued investment in our technology infrastructure and resiliency as well as equipment expenses as we move more activities to the cloud transaction processing was down primarily driven by lower market data and brokerage costs occupancy was down reflecting the benefits from eliminating another seats and achieving occupancy rate and other expenses were down too overall were pleased this year with our continued ability to demonstrate productivity and expense discipline excluding the impact of currency translation with approximately one percentage point full year expenses would have been flat and in a year where fee revenue growth grew by mid singledigits we meaningfully expanded our pretax margin and generated positive total and fee operating leverage despite a challenging interest rate environment moving to slide on the left side of the slide we show the evolution of our cet1 and tier leverage ratios followed by our capital trends on the right side of the slide as you can see we continue to navigate the operating environment with strong capital levels with or without the recent equity raise relative to our requirements as of quarter end our standardized cet1 ratio of increased percentage points quarteronquarter primarily reflecting an outsized reduction of about billion in rwa related to the impact of fx marktomarkets and higher retained earnings we expect rwas to increase in the first quarter to more normalized business levels and the effects of expected regulatory changes coming in all of which has been previously considered in our capital guidance state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 our tier leverage decreased slightly quarteronquarter mainly driven by higher client deposits and lastly we returned a total of million to shareholders in the form of fourth quarter dividends as previously communicated we expect our cet1 and tier leverage ratios to be at the lower end of our target ranges for the first half of inclusive of the implementation of saccr and the expected closing of the brown brothers investor services acquisition turning to slide you can see a summary of our and fullyear results ive already covered fourth quarter in detail so let me say a few words about our full year results before jumping into our outlook for in summary were pleased with our strong performance this year notwithstanding the challenging interest rate environment we delivered a increase in total fee revenue for the year with servicing and management fees reaching our highest levels on record our expenses for the full year remained well controlled and despite higher revenuerelated costs and investments in our business and people as a result even in last years low rate environment we delivered positive operating leverage and we were able to drive pretax margin and roe closer to our recently enhanced mediumterm targets and with that ill turn to outlook on slide let me cover our fullyear outlook as well as provide some thoughts on the first quarter both of which do not yet include the previously announced acquisition of the brown brothers investments services we continue to target a closing by the end of the first quarter although the timing could fall in the second quarter we are in the process of obtaining the required regulatory approvals some of which have already been secured the process is proceeding at a slower pace than anticipated with many regulators around the world addressing the high volume of global ma activity that said given the current higher equity market stepoff and new interest rate forward we now expect about yearonyear ebit growth for the acquired business for each quarter in the first year post closing instead of just yearonyear ebit growth in our original acquisition deal modeling now as i usually do let me first share some assumptions underlying our current views for the full year at a macro level our rate outlook largely aligns to the current forward curve and assumes we see three us rate hikes in with the first hike occurring in march we are also assuming around percentage point to point growth for equity markets in as well as further normalize fx market volatility which influences our trading businesses as for currency translation we expect the us dollar will be stronger for the year which will be a headwind to revenues but mostly offset as a benefit to expenses so beginning with revenue for the full year we currently expect that fee revenue will be up to with servicing fees growing to both include about point of currency translation headwind for regarding the first quarter of we expect fee revenue to be up to yearoveryear given equity market expectations and continued business momentum with servicing fees expected to be up to and management fees expected to be up to state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 for full year nii depending on the timing of the projected rate hikes we expect nii to be up to on a yearonyear basis regarding first quarter of we expect nii to be up to yearoveryear and still flattish sequentially now turning to expenses as you can see in the walk we expect expenses exnotables will be up just to on a nominal basis in as we continue to invest in the business and our people while driving both positive total and fee operating leverage we currently assume that this includes a percentage point benefit to expenses due to the stronger us dollar you can also see on the walk that for full year we expect another year of gross saves of approximately three to four percentage points which will help fund variable costs and ongoing business investments in areas like alpha digital tech infrastructure and automation regarding the first quarter of we expect yearonyear expense growth to be largely in line with the full year guide and include the seasonal compensation expenses which occur in the first quarter all in all our plan is to invest behind the revenues and deliver both positive total and positive fee operating leverage finally we estimate our effective tax rate to be in the to range for and with that let me hand the call back to ron ronald philip ohanley chairman president chief executive officer state street corp thanks eric operator we can now open the call for questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from alex blostein of goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys happy new year to both of you so maybe we can start unpacking some of the guidance and im sure theres going to be a good amount of followups on the back of that as well but maybe just starting with the fee guide really zoning in on servicing fees state street has obviously made a considerable amount of improvement in retaining clients and winning new business so maybe help us unpack within the to growth for the year what sort of contemplated from markets in terms of the benefit of the that you guys highlighted earlier so how much does the market benefit versus the net new business and pricing and im assuming blackrock is included in this guidance as well but how much of a drag in the servicing fee revenue you guys expect from loss of the blackrock mandate eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp alex its eric happy new year to you too let me cover fees and then servicing fees which i think is where youre focused our guide for total fee revenue is up to for the year our guide for servicing fee is up to and obviously that includes about one percentage point of headwind from foreign exchange so in effect the servicing fees are up for example to in our guide adjusted for currency translation if you think about the drivers weve factored in all the known events both our growth our installations net new business and so forth if you want to peel it apart a little more deeply we start off at a good equity market level and we expect some yearonyear growth from equity markets thats probably worth about two percentage points of a tailwind to growth flows and client activity which are variable is probably worth another percentage point and part of our kind of fee structures net new business is continues to tick up we expect core net new business to be up and that obviously includes all the new onboardings offset by any attrition so thats on a net basis and then obviously theres just the usual grind down of pricing and that kind of gets you to the low end of our range we think theres some upside which is why adjusted for currency the servicing fee guide is in the to range and what it does is it represents the continued acceleration of our business towards our mediumterm targets which are really in the to range alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc great thats perfect and just maybe staying on the topic but looking at the expense side of the pl the to growth i think is contemplated on obviously the fee outlook that you just outlined if we are in a tougher equity market backdrop and lets say you guys dont hit the to servicing fee growth or the to fee growth what are sort of the bookends around the expense growth trajectory that we could see this year so in other words like in flat equity markets should we expect you to be below the guide on expenses given theres maybe more flexibility or kind of the range is the range and the revenue will be more kind of working independently state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp alex thats a fair question and you can see that part of the way we create some ill call it insulation for ourselves as we think about equity markets and where they might go whether its up a lot modestly flat or down is that weve designed our plans with the view that we should intend to deliver a couple of points of operating leverage and actually a couple of points of fee operating leverage right that couple of points gives us some flexibility to handle some variability in what happens in actuality in equity markets i think so certainly well move within our range based on what we see obviously if we see a market an equity market correction of down or down well do everything we can to come in below our range and certainly we can flex in this business a full point can be flexed its not easy but it can be flexed and that would be the approach that we take but were confident with kind of the level of equity markets they are today part of this part of what we see is a fairly nominal uptick in equity markets so we think this is a good kind of middle of the fairway plan but well certainly flex it we to the extent that we can alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc thats great thanks very much for the color eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners hey good morning maybe you could just talk a little bit about the bbh i appreciate the discussion around the increase in ebit from rates how much of that can you speak to their offbalance sheet sweep deposits maybe update us on the level of that and how you think those act at a rising rate environment in terms of the sweep fees is it pretty similar to the spread on deposits eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp jim its eric the business that brown brothers has run on the investment services side is performing well so what weve seen is with the higher equity markets weve seen their servicing fees come in a bit stronger for this coming year i think the deposits both on balance sheet and the swept ones are within the range of what weve seen and i think we described those as a bit under billion on balance sheet and a bit over billion swept and theyre coming right around that range and thats our expectation for the both the on and offbalance sheet do have a good translation into higher revenues as rates move up and onbalance sheet betas are similar to ours and we had very nice betas in the early part of the last rate cycle and expect to have that again on ours and on theirs and then the offbound sweeps also have betas theyre not quite as strong as deposits but theyre in the range actually and that also will provide some very nice i think fee growth as we take on that business jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 okay great and then maybe just pivoting to the asset management business you had record flows strongest flows in many years can you just describe where the biggest drivers of that growth are coming from what youre doing to enhance that growth and is this more just the environments great or do you think theres some sustainability to that inflow ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp jim its ron let me take that i think that the growth is reasonably broadbased in the sense that its firstly from our investments and ongoing investments in the etf business so you saw lots of strength in the core spdr offerings which are really instruments of choice for large institutional investors and good growth in areas where we have invested active etfs fixed income the lowcost etfs nonus so we expect to continue to see a good performance there particularly as weve worked to solidify our position with institutional investors secondly in the institutional in the traditional institutional space the teams done a lot of work in developing products that are companions to the core index business we have a great client roster and weve seen some diversification in that business and finally weve got a great cash business there and obviously it ebbs and flows as cash does itself but well also benefit a little bit from rising rate environments as the remainder of the fee waivers goes away so its really across the board jim mitchell q analyst seaport research partners okay thanks for the color operator your next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so first eric i just wanted to unpack some of the nii the assumptions underpinning some of the nii guidance i was hoping you can just share some insights in terms of what youre contemplating as the fed initiates qt in terms of just deposit flight broadly or deposit runoff and maybe deposit remixing out of noninterestbearing deposits and just in terms of spot rates where youre reinvesting today versus the back book yield eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure steve its eric let me do that in reverse order i think the front book and the back book are starting to converge in the investment portfolio and youll see that our investment portfolio yields took another small tick downward this quarter in fourth quarter but starting in first quarter well see that relatively flat and then youll state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 see a slow progression upwards so were comfortable with where we are in terms of long rates and obviously the higher the loan rates come in the better off well be the nii uptick for this year and then let me get to the question around balances and quantitative tightening i think its just comfortably dependent on the fed increases i think were showing to expectations in nii a little more than half of that is off of rising shortterm us rates about a little less than a quarter is off rising non us shortterm rates and then the last portion is off of the rise in long rates so were really geared towards the front end rates and then that flows through directly to balances for deposit balances we currently expect us and international deposit balances to be flattish id say this year and i think were all wrestling with whats the pace of the feds actions in terms of rising interest rates when does that start and then when do they start with the with some amount of quantitative tightening and i think its just helpful to bookend this theres been a lot of discussion about quantitative tightening for the last week or two certainly it will happen if you go back to the last cycle which was just three four years ago so not a long time away quantitative tightening started two years after the first rate rise and a full year after the second and third and fourth kind of that steeper part of the rate rising cycle and so i think quantitative tightening therell be a bit indiscernible and this is something to expect in more than and will thereby and then have some effect on deposits how much its hard to tell as you know this cycle weve controlled some of the uptick in deposits we had pushed them off in third quarter as you recall let some back in this quarter well certainly see some deposits ebb downwards in and perhaps or potentially just stay flattish because the question is the pace of the quantitative tightening and if you recall last time around just i guess three four years ago i think the fed felt like it tightened too much right and created some disruptions in the shortterm money markets and so but we expect some tightening to happen in say a year and half from now or thereabouts well see i think the pace of the tightening may be more moderate but anyway well see well see thats call it a topic i think should be fairly straight steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thanks for that context eric and just for a followup on how youre thinking about capital management you spoke about reinitiating the buyback beginning in i was hoping if you can give us some context as to like what level of payout youre planning as we look ahead to and just in terms of future changes to the capital regime any guidance you can provide on the impact of saccr and preliminary thoughts on the impact of upcoming changes under a basel iv regime would be really helpful eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure theres a lot there steve in your question steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp so let me take it kind of from the near end timeframe to further out weve i think were pretty comfortable with our capital guidance that well be at the low end of our to range for cet1 in the first quarter that includes both the saccr being implemented and the consummation of the brown brothers acquisition so that i think will carry us through at the low end of our range for the first half of this year and were i think comfortable with both of those as we go through the year in the second quarter wed certainly like to start the buyback well see at what pace the pace of a buyback start will depend on the kind of the exact capital ratios as we hit first quarter and then second quarter well see how oci swings either positively or negatively and so i think that then sets us up to start buying back stock in the second quarter and then proceeding at pace in the third quarter fourth quarter and beyond and then i think at that point were back trying to were not trying but operating within our guidance that capital return should be in the plus of earnings and that puts us i think in a way that we continue to return through dividends and buybacks capital in a nice comfortable way so anyway a nice path forward but first half of this year i think low end of our ranges and then in the second quarter and then third quarter fourth quarter we start to reinstate and then accelerate in buybacks to a comfortable level the basel iii refinements basel iv end game there are different ways indiscernible out there it will certainly come to pass clearly well get some benefits on the loan book though we have a smaller loan book than others so well probably get some headwinds from the fundamental review of the trading book and then some headwinds from the ops risk capital charges so my guess is it will be a bit of a headwind but like i said before its been all factored into our capital ratio guidance we generate quite a bit of capital each year and we feel comfortable that we can continue to deliver on our mediumterm targets of returning or more of earnings back to shareholders steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats great color eric and just quickly can you did you quantify the impact from sacr just so we could start to reflect that in our models eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yes i didnt in the prepared remarks but the rough amount we carry typically about billion of rwas it was a little less this quarter sacr is will cost us in the first quarter just over billion and weve got offsetting actions worth about half of that about half so call it around billion so i think net basis its probably worth about of rwa but as i said before in my prepared remarks this has all been factored into our capital guidance that we gave back over the last several quarters and were confirming and affirming that will be within our ranges in the first half of the year steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood eric thanks so much for taking my questions state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure operator your next question comes from gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning eric good morning ron ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp hi gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc eric can you give us some further color on you gave us good detail on the servicing fee growth and how you expect to see that to grow this year with some new inflows as you pointed out but also from some equity improvement in the markets i think you said about percentage points of that number when you take the when you look at the equity portion how important is the us markets versus emea and the other markets can you kind of give us a flavor is it generally geared toward the us markets that drives your growth eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp gerard its eric its really a mix i think maybe almost if i just think about the ranges its a bit under half thats driven by us markets closer to probably i dont know a thirdish of european markets and then australia and emerging markets just because of the in some cases the higher fee rates is also important that could be worth the other is remember we have part of our book is fixed income assets that we service and so thats why equity market tailwinds affect part of our book but not all of our book in rising rates weve got the opposite effect on the fixed income side what i just as we from planning purposes as we go into the year though on a pointtopoint basis or if we were to stay flat from now through the end of the year versus the average of last year of that in and of itself should give us at least point points of servicing fee lift and then what were talking about is whether the pointtopoint growth from december to december can give us that extra point so i think thats how you get the roughly percentage point tailwind that we expect some of it is in a way baked in assuming markets dont go down and then a smaller piece is coming from some modest depreciation gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup you discussed it as have your peers about the expectation of rising interest rates and shortterm rates run rates in can you share with us the duration of the fixed income portfolio and what rates should we watch carefully that would impact the aoci meaning the marktomarket would be negative for the portfolio state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yes we the duration of the investment portfolio we inched down this quarter you could have seen that in the nii slide that we had i think were at about years so trended down a bit from the last quarter last couple of quarters and right now were a little more comfortable weve been investing in the belly of the curve kind of the two to fiveyear range i think that 10year up through percentage points is quite comfortable for us including from an oci management standpoint i think if you get a good bit above percentage points on the 10year you kind of have a you got a double effect on one hand you get an oci hit which obviously accretes back over time so its temporary and on the other hand you celebrate higher rates flowing through the investment portfolios over the coming quarters so i think its mixed but net positive if we have some sort of spike at the back end but it would affect just the mechanics of how we operate quartertoquarter on the margin gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc i appreciate that thank you eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp thank you gerard operator operator instructions your next question comes from the line of rob wildhack with autonomous research robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research good morning guys you had another good quarter of loan growth here with average loans up sequentially what were the drivers there and how sustainable do you think that is into eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp rob its eric loan growth has been good for us the last say couple of years to be honest i think weve comfortably driven loan growth quarterafterquarter up in the low doubledigits on a yearoveryear basis this quarter we continue to see good client demand but we also shifted some we also added some clos in loan form as we reduced the clos and securities form from the investment portfolio so there was a bit of a shift that said i think in general what were comfortable doing is continue to grow core loans because thats we wont always have a shift every quarter this is more episodic just as we rebalance and think about stress testing and how to operate efficiently with our multiple constraints but were still comfortable continuing to grow this loan portfolio in the low doubledigit range it wont happen every quarter theres a little bit of seasonality but we continue to see quite strong demand from our alternative clients and private equity capital call financing we see demand in some ph parts of the alternative and real estate markets that we play in and the biggest focus id say is as we lend more and deploy capital to our clients a lot of what we do is work with them state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 and make sure thats part of a broader relationship because thats where it really is remunerative for us and for them and helps us grow the helps us build the reputation and the momentum to build the fee line as well robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it thank you and then turning to expenses and operating leverage the outlook implies maybe a percentage point delta between fee growth and expense growth but that also bakes in plus or from investments in variable costs do you think of that as still an elevated level of investment and theres some more operating leverage available longerterm or is this kind of the required level of investment going forward eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp its hard to forecast the future the amount of investments is partly around whats table stakes in the marketplace and partly around where do we see opportunities to differentiate our offerings and clearly youve seen us invest in particular in alpha in the front office and alpha that spans into the middle and back office and were also finding opportunities in the back office to invest through sort of feature functionality enhancements in custody in some areas of accounting which also is attractive segment by segment so its hard for me to say whats the necessary amount of investments we think theres a range we think last year we probably invested a bit less than this probably instead of to id say there was probably points less of investments during so i think what youll see is youll see us flex the amount of investments from one year to the next i think what were conscious of is that confidence in investing should come from seeing the revenue growth and seeing the revenue growth from past investments and thats what were seeing were seeing the revenue growth on the past investments that weve made across the franchise and i think that gives us the confidence to continue to carefully invest and in some cases accelerate that but i think in modest ways i think the other part of our culture has been to at the same time as we invest find productivity and savings we think thats an important part of how to run a business but certainly a business that over time were digitizing and automating should come with productivity savings and engineering and i think the other part of our business processes and i think youd hear this from our senior executives the more we can drive in productivity saves the more we feel comfortable in investing and thats a very thats a virtuous circle robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research yeah thats helpful ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah rob what i would this is ron robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research im sorry ron go ahead state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp what i would just add to that is that its actually good news that were seeing opportunities to invest in the business because particularly as weve built out the alpha platform which was originally aimed at the asset management space and the traditional asset managers were now starting to roll out alpha for private markets so its good that were seeing the opportunities but i would underscore erics point that notwithstanding that goodness what were focused on is continuing to eke out higher and higher productivity and we see more opportunities there so we see the ability of this virtuous cycle to continue for quite a while longer and the fact that there are investment opportunities is actually a good thing because it shows that notwithstanding the narrowness of where we operate theres plenty of spaces to grow robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research got it and fair to characterize it then that this level of investment maybe last year and this year gives you the capacity in the room to play both offense and defense ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yes robert wildhack q analyst autonomous research great thank you operator your next question comes from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc i like that that rhymes question on the deferred comp acceleration im just curious at what level employee are we talking and im asking because the deferred portion obviously youre saying to get practices more competitive so that presumes that you were deferring more than peers and that going forward youd have a higher cash piece going forward im just curious on its probably included obviously in your expense guide but whats changing here and why was what i was thinking ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah glenn for the employees that are going to feel this would be our not our most senior employees it would be kind of the middlesenior lowersenior if you will and down so in our parlance avps vps mds and some of the senior vice presidents will see it glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay and then state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp glenn just to give you context the weve made this change we had made one change five years back and i think this now gets us to be competitive with the marketplace and the way the facts that might help a little bit is way back when we had immediate cash in the range of compensation for the average employee the deferred cash was and the equity the deferred equity was that was a place that was completely out of market we fixed about twothirds of that five years ago and got to immediate cash deferred cash and deferred equity and now were with this final change were going to take that up to the immediate cash to to the deferred cash to just to mostly for the most senior folks and then the deferred equity stays at so we think were now in line with the market as part of this change what does happen is youve got to crystallize some of these deferrals into the pl in the current period and then what that allows us to do is going forward to add to the cash mix and because weve crystallized the previous deferrals those dont hit the pl in the future but the new cash will hit the pl in the future so this will be neutral to subsequent periods on the expense line glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay thank you very helpful i was going through your four objectives ron and the first three i think are straightforward and i think everyone has high confidence in your ability to do those im curious on the how to and what youre doing what youre going to measure on number four which was the must be a higher performanceoriented organization just curious on how you indiscernible how youre going to execute on that ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp yeah so i mean this is an ongoing objective of ours glenn and it really is around performance culture and if you think about culture which is a very used and sometimes maligned term for us its about desired behaviors and on the flip side kind of eliminating undesirable behaviors so what were focused on is those desirable behaviors all related to kind of driving performance i would argue that its even more important now than when we started a couple of years ago because on top of everything else that we need in terms of serving our clients and serving our shareholders were now operating were now all operating in this hybrid world for the foreseeable future that puts a burden new burdens and new requirements on managers particularly middle managers so its all about being able to eke out the benefits which are considerable in a hybrid world in terms of employee flexibility and some real estate cost savings and those kinds of things but at the same time making sure that were continuing to deliver where we are so we think about performance in terms of and we think about our culture and high performance in terms of behaviors glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thanks a lot ron state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 operator your next question comes from brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to circle back eric i believe i just wanted to kind of clarify some of the points you made i think you talked about bbh and the ebit growth expected to accelerate here in up to so just to make sure im levelsetting correctly you also talked about some strength in servicing its not all nii that should we apply that to the million that you provided previously when you announced the deal or did that actual number shift from expectation and am i using the right baseline and then for the other disclosures you provided around the revenue and whatnot should we did those shake out in line with expectations or did they work out to be a little better as you alluded to and how should we think about that baseline when we think about three quarters of a year here for them eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp yeah let me fair questions brennan its eric we had as you remember accurately estimated their performance to be ebit of about million they came in right around that level so were comfortable with that as a base case and if you recall we had shown growth from to in some of our documentation as we announced the brown brothers investment services acquisition from a deal model perspective at the time we had expected off of the base to grow at about so in line with the past part of that was the equity market tailwinds continue to play through and part of that was just good business performance they our brown brothers colleagues and investment services really drive a nice set of initiatives each year to drive growth client activity and so forth and what were finding now is because of the equity market step off and the interest rate environment we expect to be roughly at about a ebit growth from to i think a portion of that is on the equity is on the servicing fee line a portion of that is on the fee line that comes from the sweeps remember that comes through the fees as well and then a portion is from onbalance sheet nii and i dont have the pieces handy but clearly the interest rate tailwind is probably the more significant of those factors and that will affect both the on balance sheet and the swept deposits brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay great thank you for that clarification and then separate issue for my second question it looks like theres a transitional leadership it seems like cyrus is retiring in the asset management business thats been a business where theres been both speculation and open discussion with you all in the past about strategic direction and whatnot what does the transition in leadership present as far as an opportunity to shift strategic direction and what can you let us know about your updated thoughts on that business and whether or not a leadership transition is impacting the direction you want to go thanks ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp brennan i mean as you can maybe see from our results weve invested in that business over the years and the investments are paying off we like the business its very complementary to the core servicing business having one of the largest asset managers also as our client of our core business has been able to let us have a bit of an rd laboratory theres client overlap in certain segments like asset owners and sovereign wealth funds that state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 weve gotten better and better at leveraging so we like the business we intend to stay in the business under cyrus leadership theyve done a great job and the numbers speak for themselves there so i wouldnt expect to see a broad strategic change here certainly not in that direction i just outlined i mean theres always opportunities to do more and do better in all of our businesses so well want to continue to do that weve got a very strong talent base there but this is an attractive business and one in which we will look inside and out and get the right person to take us to the next level here but we have full intention of continuing to run and grow that business brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc okay thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from mike brown with kbw michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning thanks for taking my questions so i appreciate the update on bbh and the ebit outlook there and i guess as we move closer to that closing date i was just curious the change in the ebit outlook and the operating environment does that actually trigger any increase in the total consideration that will need to be paid obviously the implied valuation would be lower than that announcement that was just one thought that crossed my mind and then the followup there is can you just remind us of the unexpected fee synergies specifically which ones do you feel confident that you can deliver on sooner after the close versus the one that will take more time to come through thank you ronald philip ohanley a chairman president chief executive officer state street corp mike why dont i start that and ill turn the synergy part of the question over to eric but no theres no contingencies in the purchase price either up or down other than the usual ones that you would expect in terms of risk management so no theres no additional payment that will be due here eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp and mike its eric just on the synergies i think each one of them has a cadence some of which we did spell out i think on the cost synergies which is the opportunity and thats obviously come sometimes will come out of their base of expenses sometimes our base of expenses as we put the two together we had estimated about of our cost synergies would come in year one and then the balance year two and three and thats probably the single largest area in terms of the fee synergies the balance sheet actions should come through relatively quickly we can modulate the amount of swept versus onbalance sheet deposits because weve got the capital resources planned for that and i think thats one of the ways that we create real value and then the last one on the fee revenue synergies some of the fx kind of market synergies come in a little more quickly right because its about offering a broader set of say fx products on which were more capitalintensive state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 than simple swaps forwards that is more about setting up clients and then quickly being there for them and then some of the servicing ones take a little longer on part of the sales cycle but i think theres a good mix and obviously as we work on closing and bringing brown brothers in part of what weve been doing is as you expect kicking the tires on what are the opportunities how to go to the next round of definition on those so that we can hit the ground running and as ive said when we announced the deal wed like to meet or exceed our targets and i think the exogenous market tailwinds are part of that but wed also like to do it on through old fashion execution as well michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great i appreciate the color there and maybe just one last one just a quick clarification apologies if i missed but did you quantify that discrete tax benefit or is the best way to think about that is just back into it after considering your typical tax rate eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp its i wrestled mike with that because there were actually a series of tax benefits that came through this quarter there was some closing of the previous year tax books there were some foreign credits that accrue in those jurisdictions which then help our gaap taxes and then there are some foreign credits but then kind of map back into the us as a tax payment of the deduction so theres a series of them i think the best way to do it is to probably take our full year tax rates are typically in the to range so you take the midpoint of that think about full year this year now with these discrete which were more elevated than usual in a good way got us to closer to tax rate and i think the difference is probably the you might call the lumpy piece what i do what i would though also note is that i think tax planning has been the kind of thing that weve done for many years we do it were always on the bright side of the line and we do it carefully we part of it being an international bank we like other international banks are able to do some a modest amount of tax planning and so youll see it i think its we see that come through the pl annually it just tends to be a little lumpy quartertoquarter and it was a little more lumpy good than usual this particular quarter michael brown q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay understood i appreciate the taxes are always complicated subject so thanks for the color eric eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure thank you mike operator your next question comes from brian bedell with deutsche bank brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks good morning maybe just to circle back on the deposit opportunity for bbh just to clarify i think you said theres right now billion of deposit indiscernible on the balance sheet of bbh and then billion additional in the sweep program and i think initially you were planning to bring about a total of state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 billion inclusive of the deposits on the balance sheet over to state street to convert initially i think billion was the conversion to get you to billion maybe if you could just update us on the plan for if you do close at quarter end in the first quarter of what youd like to bring on and then maybe just talk more strategically about maybe what kind of portion of that sweep opportunity you might bring on to on the balance sheet i guess capital permitting eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure brian its eric i think you have a good estimate of those just for the broader group i think we said about billion to billion are on the balance sheet today about billion are offbalance sheet in swept as we consummate the acquisition and were targeting the first quarter indiscernible the end of the first quarter were targeting we said it could be in the second quarter this stuff just takes time were looking to bring on the billion to billion that they have on the balance sheet and probably another 10ish billion or so that is swept i think over time the question is really at what interest rate levels do we operate at if were at prevailing short rates of basis points lets say then on balance sheet deposits arent terribly attractive but when you hit prevailing interest rates of bps or bps and obviously you can do this across different currencies then youre more inclined to bring more on balance sheet and so we think of it as a range i think we also though are quite we want to be quite thoughtful about maintaining a program that works well it works well for our clients and the brown brothers investment services clients it works well for a number of global financial institutions that they have relationships with that they sweep primarily dollar deposits to who appreciate those deposits and so we certainly want to maintain the program for sweeps to want to maintain it in size but you can certainly see swings of another billion beyond the initial move potentially but were i think well see when we get there and part of it will be discussions with the clients themselves on one hand and part of it will be with the counterparties and i think therell be goodness in opportunity here in most circumstances brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color and maybe just to segue to second question on deposit beta expectations i think you mentioned you thought they might be similar to the last hiking cycle just to confirm that it seemed like they moved around a bit during the cycle but kind of ended up around it looks like a little over of deposit beta relative to fed funds rates at the time i dont know maybe if you can clarify that and if you think that would be similar to this cycle and then obviously if you would be treating those bbh deposits in a similar fashion or do they have a different profile eric w aboaf a chief financial officer state street corp sure brian and it was actually a good opportunity we see rates rise and the likelihood of the fed funds we did get a chance to go back and revisit what we both said and what we saw from a deposit beta standpoint back in i do expect the brown brothers deposits behave similarly to ours they are primarily with asset managers they are currency by currency similar to ours but if you go back and i think we were good about disclosing our quarteronquarter interestbearing deposit betas and usually you have to do it by currency right so because of how the betas play through but in the first rate the first one or two rate hikes we saw and expect again to see deposit betas in call it range maybe state street corp stt corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2022 to range but its quite low when you get to the third fourth or fifth hike youre in the range plus or minus some as you leg into the rate cycle and its really when you get in the past there in the fifth sixth seventh hike where youre likely to get closer to interest bearing deposit betas now id like to get there wed be pleased with if we get there with that level of prevailing rates but theres i think theres a good opportunity here because in truth weve been quite limited in our ability to earn nii that covers our cost of capital and so a lot of this is just catch up to a level that are more in line with the longterm averages brian bedell q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats great color thank you operator there are no further questions ill turn the call over to ron ohanley for closing remarks ronald philip
