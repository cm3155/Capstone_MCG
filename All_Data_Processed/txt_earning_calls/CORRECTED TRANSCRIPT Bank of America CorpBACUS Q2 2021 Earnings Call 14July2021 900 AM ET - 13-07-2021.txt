yours brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning and thank all of you for joining us and thank you lee today bank of america reported billion in aftertax net income or per diluted shares these results included a few items worth highlighting and im on page ahead of paul going through the details first as asset quality continued to improve and the economy continued to recover we released billion of credit reserves established in the first half of last year the idea that a company with our credit quality and other industry participants would be releasing reserves this quarter is not new news but the reality is at bac were seeing credit quality levels that are very strong net chargeoffs fell to 25year low as a percentage of loans not just raw dollar amount let me mention a few items i dont believe were industrywide or expected at bac we recorded a billion positive income tax adjustment following last months enactment of an increase in the uk corporate income tax rate to this required a remeasurement of our deferred tax asset which just reverses the writedowns from previous years when the tax rates were lower in addition our expense levels included two things i would note these add up to about million with our strong results and the tax benefit we took the opportunity to prefund million to our charitable foundation this accelerates our planned funding for not only the rest of this year but the next year as well this is not new money just utilizing some of the tax benefit to cover future expense we also recorded roughly million of expense associated with processing transactional card claims related to state unemployment benefits this represents to a large degree a catchup as we move through claim backlogs away from these items we produced another quarter of solid earnings and showed evidence of good client activity in an economy that continued to recover from the pandemic now as we all know the healthcare crisis has shown improvement and economies has recovered progress on vaccinations along with a continued support of fiscal monetary policies has promoted a full and speedy recovery and a return to economic health we like others are reopening our facilities and were seeing more products being sold by our teammates in addition to the continued digital engagement at very high levels our advisors and bankers and relationship managers are once again meeting with clients face to face building even stronger relationships we are seeing customer demand continue to grow given the opportunities our companies see i want to take a minute or two on the economy and if you go to slide we have included a few slides highlighting our customer data let me hit a few highlights the gdp growth estimates by our bofa securities research team for the second quarter stand at and stand at for the full year the reopenings further driving projections of an economy thats continued to grow at a rate above the prepandemic periods into also the unemployment rate dropped below this quarter ph is projected by economists to continue to fall we also note the stability of increased consumer spending from our own bac customers which is not only much higher than same periods in which you would expect but is notably higher than the first half of compared to and you can see that on lower right of the page ph that growth rate was already growing strongly before the pandemic bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 a few comments regarding the characteristics of spending i think are interesting we are halfway through the year and the total payments through all the different means are trillion thats of last years level last year indeed was a record even though it was suppressed in various periods when businesses were shut down more specifically for the second quarter the total bac consumer small business payments set a fourth quarterly consecutive record reaching billion up yearoveryear and over the trend has also continued into early july spending accelerated as covid vaccinations increased business reopened and domestic travel increased combined spend at retailers and services comprises over of debit and credit card spending a portion of the total spend that increased over second quarter but this ph flow that towards the end of the quarter as consumers moved their attention and started taking summer leisure trips and activities you can see that by noting the return of travel and entertainment spending which comprises about of debit and credit card spend you can see ph while recovering travel remains below ph while recovering travel remains below spending levels splitting this travel up a bit as of midjune domestic airline purchases were up over while international airline purchase on our cards are still down approximately showing the difference of the progress against the war on the virus in united states ph versus other places now lets go to slide we just put this chart in to show you that the consumers are paying their bills we have shown this each quarter so you can see that the actual card delinquency levels continue to edge down even as people are out and circulating the economy before we go to paul i want to comment specifically on three areas of interest to you loan growth nii and expense were going to do that on pages and so first on loans paul and i are going to show you the average loans paul will show you that later end of period loans ill show you in a minute and longterm trends which are on page what all these figures point to is accelerating growth during the quarter as we have spoken about on occasion this quarter we saw loan levels across most every business move past stabilization and begin to make progress companies need to build inventory hire workers to meet the growing customer demand this virtuous circle of hiring workers and ph meeting customer spending will help drive the economy and hopefully will resolve more line usage on our loans you can see the path on slide of loans since the pandemic started in march as you can see all of them are turning up in recent months but moving to slide you see the more traditional detail for our company lets start on the lower righthand side of that slide and talking about the commercial portfolio commercial loan balances after adjusting for the reductions of ppp loans for quarter two forgiveness grew billion this was led by global markets client borrowing activity but beyond that and still excluding the ppp loan forgiveness middle market lending group and our business banking team finally had growth in the month of june a first since last march fueling some of this improvement is calling effectiveness relationship managers have increased their calling efforts were now aggressively calling our targeted prospects and with vaccination progress facetoface meetings have nearly doubled each month over the past days commercial loans wealth management clients grew an impressive in the quarter as these customers borrow through our custom lending products in small business our practice solutions group which supports medical bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 dental and veterinary practices has been building throughout the quarter and small business production overall is back to prepandemic levels turning to consumer loans overall growth in endofperiod loans was billion card loans grew with increased spending even as customer payment percentages remained high auto originations have grown fairly consistently although recently lower dealer supplies have affected them mortgage balance growth which is a big part of our loan portfolio in consumer has been a challenge in the lowrate environment with high refinancing volumes exceeding originations in past quarters we are only modestly down this quarter as our origination volumes are finally overcoming the payoffs we are pleased with the trajectory through the period and that feeds into the second half of the year while average loans drive ph that loan balances during the third quarter will drive nii its good to start with a trend that has reversed the past quarters declines on nii the good news is that we correctly called a bottom three quarters ago we told you that we thought the third quarter of would be the trough despite the volatility and lower rate moves and significant decline in loans weve been able to hold nii at that level or more for three straight quarters we expect it to move higher and paul is going to discuss that later the other area i want to comment on is expense on a reported basis we saw billion in expense reduction from first quarter of to second quarter of this quarter we also had around million in notable items for the aforementioned charitable contributions on employment claims process absent those notable items expense would have been down about a billion dollars and in the low billion range this is a level we are targeting expense as we move through the rest of the year in the second half of the year as we normalize our operations well continue to return our business as usual working on process improvements that allow us to reduce our head count and to continue to fund franchise investments headcount in the second quarter excluding the summer interns declined by roughly or on the first quarter so the messages for this quarter are straightforward the organic growth machine that we had rolling before the pandemic hit is reemerging as the economy normalizes we still have to be careful to ensure that the war on the virus stays won but were seeing great returns in retail and preferred and small business we saw strong production of core transaction accounts above prepandemic levels this quarter was our best net sales growth in checking account since the second quarter we saw card production about overall pre pandemic but net cards net of runoffs were positive the first time since the first quarter of when we entered the pandemic we saw growth in new merrill lynch investment accounts and paul will talk to you about that we saw good mortgage production we saw stronger digital activity in wealth management we saw household growth and strong flows continue to grow even with use of our banking platform to grow its credit side in global banking we saw loan growth and new production coming on while line usage still remains very low we saw investment banking close this quarter with record pipelines in markets we saw a strong first half even compared to and a strong second quarter albeit with more normal seasonal impact so normalizing more like but still higher and we saw head count come down as operational excellence kicked in by over people we have work to do to keep driving down the core expenses and getting out the net covid expenses over time and above all due to responsible growth we saw strong core credit metrics so as economy continues to recover we are seeing organic growth engine kick back in with that ill turn it over to paul bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 paul m donofrio chief financial officer bank of america corp thanks brian hello everyone im starting on slide as i have done in the past few quarters the majority of my comments or excuse me my comparisons will be relative to the prior quarter rather than yearoveryear given the pandemic since brian already covered a lot of the income statement i will just add a couple of comments on revenue and returns revenue was down from q1 the decline was driven by lower sales and trading results that more than offset solid consumer and wealth management revenue which was a result of higher card income and aum fees it is also worth noting that while investment banking fees were down from a record q1 level they remained strong at more than billion in q2 lastly when comparing revenue against the prioryear quarter remember q2 included a million gain on the sale of some mortgage loans with respect to returns our return on tangible common equity was and roa was basis points both benefiting from the positive tax adjustment and sizable reserve release moving to slide balance sheet expanded billion versus q1 to a little more than trillion in total assets deposit growth of billion supported billion of loan growth while the combination of marketbased funding and longterm debt issuance supported expansion of the balance sheet in global markets other notable movements on the balance sheet included the continued deployment of excess cash into securities securities increased billion while cash declined billion driven by the additional deposit growth our liquidity portfolio remained above trillion or onethird of the balance sheet shareholders equity increased billion as earnings outpaced capital distribution capital distributions of billion were limited to the average of earnings in the previous four quarters per regulatory guidelines and were well below the billion earned in the quarter with respect to regulatory ratios consistent with q1 standardized remained the binding approach for us and was down a little less than basis points from q1 while the cet1 ratio declined basis points in q1 it remained basis points above our minimum requirement of which translates into a billion capital cushion while book value rose billion regulatory capital was up billion as the billion tax adjustment did not benefit cet1 capital higher rwa from the liquidity deployed to the securities growth in our markets balance sheet and higher gwim loan activity more than offset the benefit to the ratio from higher capital our supplementary leverage ratio at quarterend was dropping from the prior quarter primarily due to the removal of the regulatory relief versus a minimum requirement of equates to approximately billion of balance sheet capacity which leaves us plenty of room for growth our tlac ratio remained comfortably above our requirements turning to slide brian reviewed ending loan balances earlier so i will focus on average balances which are more closely linked to nii as you look at the yearoveryear trends note that these numbers include ppp loans which have been moving lower now for two quarters driven by forgiveness you can see the change in those ppp levels on the slide focusing on the linked quarter change while loans on an ending basis were up nicely on an average basis even with a billion decline in ppp balances loans were flat bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 wealth management and global markets experienced the most notable improvements gwim continued to benefit from securitybased lending as well as custom lending while continuing to have solid mortgage performance in global markets we looked for opportunities to lend to clients against a number of different asset types creating mostly investmentgrade exposures as a good use of our liquidity in consumer we saw credit card loans stabilize for the first time in more than a year as credit spending ramped up and new accounts continued to build across the quarters quarterly new account levels are nearly back to levels with respect to deposits on slide we continued to see significant growth across the client base not only because of the growth in the money supply but also because we added new accounts and attracted increased liquidity from existing customers i would just note that the linked quarter growth on a spot basis included a headwind of about billion from customer income tax outflows normally we saw deposits decline in the second quarter given tax payments but this year we saw strong growth even with the tax payments turning to slide and net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii for q2 was billion billion on an fte basis net interest income declined a little more than million from q2 driven by the rate environment and lower loan balances but showed modest improvement from q1 yearoveryear comparisons beginning next quarter are expected to improve nicely as q3 has proven to be the nadir for nii and we are expecting nii improvement in q3 and q4 compared to q1 the benefit of an additional day of interest and liquidity deployed was offset by a lower level of ppp loan forgiveness the absence of proceeds recorded in nii from the q1 litigation settlement and modestly higher premium amortization expense the net interest yield declined basis points from q1 driven by the continued addition of lower yielding debt securities in q1 and q2 and a larger global markets balance sheet remember as part of our liquidity that remains i would include about billion of debt securities hedged to floating which earned a bit more than cash as you will note given all the deposit growth and low rates our asset sensitivity to rising rates remains significant and mostly unchanged from q1 highlighting the value of our deposits and customer relationships let me give you a couple of thoughts around nii for the back half of the year last quarter when the forward interest rate environment was to basis points higher we told you we were targeting nii at roughly billion higher in q4 of this year this quarters loan growth is encouraging and supportive of this target and the slowdown in mortgage prepayments should also help improve nii so while we still think getting nii billion higher by is possible admittedly a significant decline in longend rates presents a challenge this possibility of course assumes loans continue to grow in the second half and rates dont move lower from here to improve our chances we could decide to deploy additional liquidity at higher fixed rates in the coming weeks and months as we evaluate the tradeoffs between liquidity capital and earnings turning to slide and expenses q2 expenses were billion billion lower than q1 while lower than q1 the combination of the million contribution to the foundation and the nearly million increase in costs associated with unemployment claims processing kept expenses above the low billion target shared with you last quarter outside of these two items expense was lower driven by the absence of a few q1 items seasonal payroll taxes the real estate impairment charge and the acceleration of expense due to incentive comp award changes additionally lower incentive comp and severance costs also contributed to the decline lastly our bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 covid costs saw a modest decline as some pandemicrelated employee programs began to roll off but this was mitigated to a certain degree by preparation costs for associates returning to the office as we go to the segments i would just note that the sizable foundation contribution was allocated to the lines of business and therefore negatively impacts comparisons to prior quarters as we look forward we continue to invest at a high rate in people and in technology and in new financial centers we are seeing the benefits of these investments and now as we move forward we expect that natural attrition will allow us to reduce head count as we transition back to a more normal business environment as brian mentioned excluding summer interns our head count this quarter moved down by about people turning to asset quality on slide nothing but good news to report here net chargeoffs this quarter fell to million or basis points of average loan this is the lowest loss rate in more than two decades that is lower than q1 and more than below the second quarter of our credit card loss rate was and several loan product categories were in recovery position this quarter provision was a billion net benefit driven by the continued improvement in the macroeconomic outlook which resulted in the billion release of credit reserves split fairly evenly between consumer and commercial loans our allowance as a percent of loans and leases ended the quarter at which is still well above the which was the level as weve begun following our day adoption of cecl and as a reminder the mix of our loans has also changed since cecl day to the extent the economic outlook and remaining uncertainties continue to improve we expect our reserve levels could move lower okay on slide we show the credit quality metrics for both the consumer and commercial portfolio a couple of points i would make here with respect to card losses given the continued low level of latestage delinquencies in the 180day pipeline we would expect card losses to decline again in q3 for at least the next couple of quarters i would expect total net chargeoffs to moderate around the current level with lower card losses partially offset by lower net recoveries in other products with respect to commercials metrics reservable criticized exposure and npls both declined in the quarter turning to the business segments and starting with consumer on slide consumer banking produced another good quarter with strong customer deposits and investment flows and the return of card loan growth this reflects the strength of our brand our digital innovations and the deployment of specialists in our centers all of which enabled us to capture more than our fair share of the increase in customer liquidity as brian said earlier this was a quarter of reopening where both our hightech and hightouch capabilities delivered growth in client activity given vaccination progress we reopened certain financial centers more of our associates were at their posts in our financial centers and customer traffic was up all of the above drove higher sales in our centers at the same time we also saw increased sales through digital channels which suggest increases in digital engagement are here to stay the segment earned billion in q2 higher than q1 as revenue expense and credit cost all showed improvement revenue improved reflecting higher card income on increased purchase volumes and modestly higher account service charges on atm usage expenses moved lower versus q1 given the absence of the q1 real estate impairment costs and seasonal higher payroll tax expense we also saw some modest improvement in covid costs as some of the elevated pandemicrelated associated costs began to wind down our cost of deposits this quarter improved to an impressive basis points the team has done a great job of servicing more and more deposits while maintaining a strong cost discipline aided bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 by digital engagement looking back at q2 we have added more deposits while expenses have only increased a little more than annually in support of all that new activity even with covid on slide you can see the significant increase in consumer deposits and investments average deposits of billion are up billion linked quarter and nearly billion from q2 with more than of that growth in checking rate paid is down to basis points as of the deposits are low interest checking we covered loans earlier but would just note that while average loans are down linked quarter period end loans are up modestly excluding ppp as growth in card balances and vehicle lending outpaced a small decline in mortgages with respect to investment balances we reached a new record of billion growing year overyear as customers continue to recognize the value of our online offering okay on slide ill highlight a couple of points regarding the continued improvement in engagement after crossing million digital users in q1 we added another million users in q2 this quarter of our consumer households used some part of our digital platform we also reached billion logins from customers in the last days and while you will note the tremendous erica and zelle usage what i would draw your attention to is the digital sales growth which is up yearoveryear of booked mortgages in the quarter were done digitally while of direct vehicle loans were digital turning to wealth management the continued economic reopening and strong market conditions led to records in average deposits loans investment balances and asset management fees in q2 both merrill and the private bank contributed to this improvement growth in gross new households at merrill continued and the average size of the new households is larger this year than last year and at the same time net new households grew but at a slower pace given expensive competitive hiring practice across the industry we remain committed to organic growth and our advisors and private client sales force has a stronger more sustainable longterm strategy net income of nearly billion improved from q1 as we saw improvement in both revenue and expense with respect to revenue the record aum fees complemented higher nii on the back of solid loan and deposit increases expenses dropped as the absence of seasonally elevated payroll tax in q1 was partially offset by higher revenuerelated costs client balances rose to a record of trillion up billion yearoveryear driven by higher market levels as well as strong client flows lets skip to slide which highlights our progress to digitally engage wealth management clients in both merrill lynch and the private bank we are focused on three pillars for digital engagement one digital adoption and deeper engagement two modernizing our platform for advisors and clients and three secure and easy collaboration with clients weve provided stats on slide that show record levels of digital engagements improved further in q2 these are some of the highest levels of digital activity across our customers more and more clients are logging in to easily trade check balances and originate loans all through one simplified signon of checks deposited by the private bank clients and more than half of checks from merrill clients are being deposited digitally now and through leveraging ericabased ai capabilities and through use of webex meetings and secure text messaging we are making it easy and more efficient for clients to do business with us wherever and however they choose this creates additional capacity for our advisors to spend more time with existing and potential clients all right moving to global banking on slide the business earned billion in q2 improving million from q1 strong revenue growth and lower expenses were mitigated by a lower provision benefit than q1 deposit growth maintained or remained strong and increased billion to a new record outside of ppp loan bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 forgiveness we saw modest growth across the platform as discussed earlier revenue growth reflected the absence of the prior quarter impairment on some energy investments as well as increased esg investments revenue also included strong firmwide ib fees of billion down only modestly from the record q1 level this performance resulted in an improvement to a number ranking in overall fees with a pipeline that remains strong strong debt issuance was more than offset by lower equity underwriting fees we had a provision benefit driven by a reserve release of million in q2 which was million lower than the q1 release net chargeoffs were near zero reflecting both low chargeoffs and a notable recovery in the quarter noninterest expense declined from q1 reflecting lower compensation partially offset by other costs weve already covered much of the balance sheet on slide so lets skip to digital trends on slide we continued our investments in digital solutions that deliver efficiencies for both clients and our employees the solutions for clients have a compounded effect since they invariably mean less manual intervention by the bank enhancing both efficiency and satisfaction enhanced banking solutions are helping us capture greater market share as wholesale clients do more with banking partners that are stable and secure and that have the capability to invest in new technologies that will provide better data and global integrated solutions digitization and in particular artificial intelligence is helping us streamline processes and respond to clients more quickly and efficiently as an example our bankers are using technology powered by erica to not only better manage credit exposure but also identify and win new business we present some wholesale digital highlights on slide switching to global markets on slide results reflect solid but lower sales and trading activity as noted earlier while down from the more elevated pandemic periods trading revenue is still or so higher from q2 as i usually do i will talk about results excluding dva this quarter net dva was negligible but the yearago quarter had a million loss global markets produced million of earnings in q2 down more than billion compared to either q1 or the yearago quarter focusing on the yearoveryear revenue was down driven by the reduction in sales and trading the year overyear expense increase was driven by higher costs associated with processing unemployment claims and the activityrelated sales and trading costs compared to q1 expense the higher unemployment processing costs were mostly offset by lower compensation sales and trading contributed billion to revenue declining yearoveryear ficc declined while equities improved recording one of the strongest equity performances in our history ficc results reflected the much more robust trading environment in the yearago period particularly for macro products q2 saw credit tightened and agency mortgages endured a difficult trading environment given the volatility of rates the strength in equities was driven by a strong trading performance in derivatives and increased client activity notably in derivatives and in asia bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 on slide we note halfyear revenue trends across the last few years as you can see while the pandemic elevated results in remains well above the prior years presented driven by continued client activity and volatility in the market finally on slide we show all other which reported profit of billion the billion tax adjustment benefited results absent this benefit we would have reported million loss which is a decline of million from q1 driven by lower revenue revenue declined million reflecting two impacts first higher partnership losses on increased esg investments as you know we record grossedup revenue from these investments on an fte basis in global banking pay the full tax there and then back out those entries in all other you can also see the increase in esg investment in q2 in other income on our consolidated income statement where partnership losses are booked while this loss impacts revenue it is more than made up for on the tax line we expect our tax credits and associated losses in consolidated other income to increase by at least million in q3 and keep in mind q4 is normally even higher reflecting seasonal activity revenue in all other was also impacted by some refinancing activity we called and refinanced higher cost structured notes which pushed some aoci back to the income statement our effective tax rate this quarter excluding the billion tax adjustment was and further excluding tax credits driven by our portfolio of esg investments our tax rate would have been for the second half of absent any changes in current tax laws or any other unusual items we expect our effective tax rate to be in the range of to okay with that were ready to go to qa bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 question and answer section operator well take our first question from glenn schorr with evercore isi your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much wondered if we could contextualize your loan growth inflection conversation i heard you on cards and auto contributing to the modest pickup on periodend loans so im wondering what confidence level you have of that continuing in the second half will it be cardauto or will middle market ma or anything else start contributing and then maybe most importantly do you think could be a normalish loan growth year say low to midsingledigit like you had been running thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hi glenn i think if you look across all the businesses on an end of period basis had loan growth which bodes well the usage on lines is still slow and so that is still running in the low which is about basis points on average lower than the banking segment but what you see underneath that is that even business banking which is the segment from million to million is net growing finally and it was the most affected by the ppp runoff and the runoff of ppp in the quarter was billion billion or something like that so we impulse basically flat average balances that included we overcame that so we feel good as we look across the things so what you really see is the net card production back to prepandemic you see gross card production basically about of prepandemic you see autos which will pick back up as inventories become available and the real driver on the consumer side is mortgages were basically holding our own right now and that was different than frankly on the refi side we lost some balances through the last several quarters and on the commercial side its really line usage it honestly cant go any lower maybe it can but theoretically it cant because its been stuck here for a good four or five quarters with the activity but the auto dealer line usage which is on that side of the house for example is very low than it traditionally is so we expect those to pick back up but the key is were actually producing more customers and more clients even at the low usage and the loans are starting to grow glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi sounds like weve got a shot thanks brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yes glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi maybe a very similar question on expenses and then ill be done you noted that theres some covid expenses still in there but excluding the two onetimers you called out were still in the low it sounds like low billion range for the year is okay weve been asked this question every year any one of us have should be materially different than given how youre able to fund a lot of your investments internally bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so glenn this is paul were not providing specific expense outlook but i will offer the following thoughts which i think answer your question so our rough estimate for the fourth quarter expense is a range of low billion i think if you add to that the seasonal higher payroll tax approximately million in q1 plus add in inflationary costs that we have talked about now for many quarters remember if we do nothing costs would grow by or but were driving that lower every year and quarter through opex and other initiatives but if you take the expense you add the higher seasonal payroll tax you add thats a good base i think and then from there adjust based upon whatever assumption you want to make around higher revenue expectations in areas that are closely linked to compensation exchange fees i think if you do that math youll have a pretty good number glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi thank you paul appreciate it operator well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so i know in recent quarters ive been asking about just the thought process on how you deploy liquidity and securities and look its been the right call because you were buying what felt like low rates but rates have gone down again but i just want to circle back on like what is the thought process you had alluded to potentially deploying more liquidity in the coming weeks i just kind of step back and it seems like your loans are starting to grow deposit growth starting to flow and again rates have ticked down again so why lock in kind of 10year duration at these levels with that as a backdrop brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah matt ill let paul hit it more specifically but one of the things that we just have to always keep minding and youve touched on it is deposits are across trillion and the loans are million and change and that difference has got to be put to work and the reality is weve generated billion of deposit growth and we got to put it to work and thats what we do so were not timing the market or betting or aoa we just sort of deploy when were sure its really going to be there and so thats been our strategy and yes we put some to work and it turns out to be in the aftermath a good thing and id say frankly id rather have a higher rate structure itll be better for longterm earnings of the company but ill let paul talk about redeploying paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah i mean i dont know what specifics youre looking for but i would echo some of brians comments i think weve been very balanced if you look at the results compared to other banks weve maintained our nii for the last few quarters here we called the bottom in the third quarter but at the same time we were doing that we still are reserving significant liquidity so we have a lot of dry powder as we sit here today and more deposits are coming bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc so should we just think about it loans plus securities will basically equal deposits so if the loan growth is modest that you keep growing deposits sort of plowed in the securities kind of regardless of rates brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah and you got to take out we do have to keep straight cash obviously that we show you but thats generally the way to think about it and the debate is remember we hedged a lot of the stuff that we bought just to protect ourselves a little bit but thats the simple way to think about it in the bank side balance sheet thats the simple way to think about it obviously the securities runs differently paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i just reiterate like you said were going to get deposits its going to fund loan growth whatever is left over will probably go in securities but then we still have a bunch of excess liquidity so that can be deployed as well either in the near term or long term depending on how we balance liquidity against capital and earnings brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and actually going back to glenns question matt one of the things we cant take advantage of is our extreme efficiency in the consumer business with the rate structure and so i think they got down in the theyre pushing towards basis points of deposits because theyre growing core checking customers at a more rapid pace than we have grown in a while so consistently quarterafterquarterafterquarter thats going to stick to our ribs you dont pay anything for it and as rates rise itll drive efficiency but we just havent had a chance to take advantage of it frankly because of the rate structure matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thats helpful thank you operator well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp morning mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi im stuck on slide with the digital usage so i guess you have a record number of digital users you highlighted digital sales up yearoveryear where aspirationally do you want that to go and what can be the impact on head count and expenses and its the same question i asked before you have bestinclass digital cost of deposits in the consumer is the lowest in the industry but doesnt translate to the overall firm so im just trying to connect the dots from your great digital usage to better efficiency and also get some sense of your aspirations on the digital side bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so mike last question is sort of that question which is the consumer side doesnt get the advantage until you get some rate structure on the short end especially and so all that investment though it would be like were having the same conversation we had in before rates rose or when is this going to pay off and then it exploded and paid off and we expect it to happen again as the economy normalizes and we were taking good advantage of that as you well know prior to the pandemic and so let me back up on digital products and usage the key strategies weve been engaged on is ph beyond consumer and paul hit some of the wealth management pieces ph you can see them and so when were talking about the digital things were actually showing it by each segment so the growth in the wealth management side both for external usage ie customers and internal is extremely important using erica internally as a method of artificial intelligencebased natural language processing helps make people more efficient in the commercial segment and wealth management so we dont have our aspiration is just to follow and push the clients at the same time and that always has a benefit and thats why over the last decade were down people in the retail network to give you a sense and where it goes we have some internal plans we have an idea but we are sort of we dont go out and say that because frankly it happens piece by piece by piece and honestly the fte reduction in the quarter is in part due to the consumer efficiencies kicking back in once they got through ppp processing and things like that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and that reduction of the head count ph you also have to factor in the increase in head count in the front office so were getting a reduction overall if you go back prepandemic or if you look at this quarter but at the same time youre seeing a mix shift were adding more people out there talking to customers across the platform and we have less people in support in the back office mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay just one followup on that aspirational question when you stripped out and you normalize everything rates and everything else you want to do how much more do you think you can lower unit costs over the next several years and what would be the main technology driver for that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp there are basically three ways one is its all going to show up in head count and so we expect the consumer cost of deposits has gone from basis points probably years ago to basis points and so wed expect to keep driving that down and thats going to be driven by everything we just talked about when you get to revenuerelated compensation of wealth management business thats up billion from this quarter in probably or something like that and thats a good thing because we make money but that will be more driven by its production capabilities and things like that so theres basically buildings and how many do you need and how many people so thats driven by how many people and how much you pay our teammates who are talented and drive the business thats driven by how many people and we just had we have been working our way down in head count and it then froze because of all the work we had to do around the pandemicrelated programs but now its dropped by ph in the quarter and thats where it pays back bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc great all right thank you operator our next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning great slide on slide really love it thanks for all the detail i just wanted to dig in on card a little bit theres been some discussion around how spend is up a lot as you indicated as well and how much of that spend is likely to be translating into revolving versus transactor youre giving us the daily clearly we can see that here on the slide but it would be helpful to understand what youre seeing in the guts of the machine and has revolver started to pick up or does this loan growth that you show on the slide reflect just the increased spend in transactor paydown rates or similar to what theyve been over the past few months brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp so the revolver piece is starting to move forward but it is down obviously significant prepandemic the transactor fees is higher you want people to use the card you get revenue and you saw that in the fee line you get revenue from the usage and also you get revenue from the loans the loans are obviously the better part of the equation but betsy you have to realize we have about round numbers the same number of cards outstanding theres billion less balances which people didnt get any different they just have more cash and so they paid off their credit cards which is a completely responsible thing for them to do and when they can get out and spend more money which is starting to happen i think youll see them use these ph lines shortterm purchases so yeah the pay rates up but i dont think its a fundamental difference of behavior its just the opportunity to use the cards for activity has been limited coming into this quarter when you finally saw things open so well see where it goes but the good news is its going in different direction it had been leading up and thats your point about slide and the good news is the people are high credit quality so that means that the risk adjusted margin ie the margin from cards minus the chargeoffs is actually closer than what people think because the card chargeoffs would drop by million million a quarter indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay brian yeah no thats great that leads into the followup which is relating to your reserve ratio on card i think the way were calculating is around or at this stage and give us a sense as to how youre thinking about that trajectory here given that the environment has been improving what should we expect on reserves going forward paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 well ill answer the question this way if you go to cecl day i think it was 6point something right so that gives you a sense of a different environment with a different sort of economic outlook at that moment obviously as we grow loans card loans which were talking about doing ph thats going to eat into some of that excess reserve but i think between whatever you want to model on loan growth and whatever you want to think about in terms of us getting back to cecl day you could kind of come up with an answer betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right and just could you even be below cecl day one because the environment is so good right now paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp you could easily be below cecl day i mean as you know it just depends at the moment youre setting your reserve what your mix is what are your card balances and what is your view of the future and our view of the future is a more benign environment than it was on cecl day then by definition youd end up with lower reserves brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp and thats the point on page betsy really goes to your question on card specifically betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks very much operator our next question comes from steven chubak with wolfe research please go ahead steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so paul it was certainly encouraging to hear that theres still a path to the billiondollar improvement in that nii exit rate that you cited just given some of the longend pressures since you gave that guidance i was hoping you can just help us unpack some of the component pieces given its a meaningful stepup versus what we saw in the most recent quarter and maybe just thinking about it in three buckets loan growth liquidity deployment and premium am being the third assuming no change in the forward like how can we underwrite that path to the billiondollar increase off the current base bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp so i would say that its about half loan growth well first back out we have an extra day okay back that out and as we sit here today it would be roughly half loan growth and half premium amort reduction having said that its a challenge given that effective rates have fallen its a challenge its hard to get there and so weve always had the opportunity to deploy a little more liquidity as we think about this going forward steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc understood at least the premium am ultimately will come its just a question of timing there so but understand that that could at least impact where it shakes out by the end of the year the other thing i wanted to get a better sense of paul is just on the capital comments that you made earlier you noted that youre at bps above your minimum just curious if you can give us some sense as to where you plan on operating on a steady state basis how much cushion you want to retain and just given the strength of your excess capital position how should we be thinking about the pace or cadence of the buyback for the next four quarters brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp obviously were allowed to do it so thats a change and at a level that allows us to move capital off the balance sheet instead of constrained by the average of earnings which was through this quarter so itll move up but i think we try to operate basis points above the minimum indiscernible target because theres volatility so our slr of has got basis points of cushion in it and we want to operate basis points there so is et cetera so you should expect us not immediately well moving towards that over time and then as this goes through the period the question will be whats the ultimate ph gsib level that we have to maintain in the future and things like that so but we can move at pace now and we couldnt before because it was constrained your dividends plus your buybacks could only equal your earnings and we were a company that went into this crisis with a lot more excess capital and we are a company that came out of this crisis with a lot more excess capital and there were three ccar exams during this crisis and we had the lowest losses and stayed below the ph scb so off we go but as you know that constraint you got to go to the lowest constraint and add basis points and you should expect us to stay above that but its right now thats a lot of excess cash steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc if i can just squeeze in one more sorry just got a bunch of questions on the global markets loan growth which was a pretty eye popping number i was hoping you can just unpack the opportunity that youre seeing within that segment and whether theres further runway for continued growth just given how significant of an uptick we saw in the most recent quarter paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 yeah sure so we did that activity the loan growth was led by global markets but we did see it across the platform including middle market and other areas in global markets we just look for opportunities to use some of our liquidity in a more constructive way than maybe buying more securities and it was across a number of different types of opportunities and clients but about i would say billionish of it went into our decision to hold some clos in loan form now we concentrated those holdings in aaa and aa tranches instead of distributing the securities to investors and we think that activity is very consistent with our plan to allocate more balance sheet to customers in global markets having said all that because i know people concentrate on clo exposure our clo exposure is still extremely low relative to our peers steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc fair enough thanks for accommodating the additional question operator our next question is from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning if i could just delve further on the commercial loan topics as you start to see a little bit better demand aside from ppp across whether its corporate which you just talked about commercial small business what is your sense from the customer base of where its potentially coming back the most and where the most holdbacks are because customers still have tons of excess liquidity to get through before they borrow paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp well look if you look at global banking this quarter middle market was driven by food products commercial services and suppliers and diversified wholesalers obviously youve still got some industries that are affected by the pandemic and so they really havent started to recover yet if you look at our commercial committed exposures by the way they grew billion quarteroverquarter were now above the trillion prepandemic level so people are getting ready to borrow more as brian noted the revolver utilization is still at historic lows but wed expect that to move up as the economy improves and then in global markets as i mentioned there were lots of opportunities in mortgage warehouse lending subscription facilities assetbacked securitization there were lots of opportunities there to put more balance sheet to work kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks paul and as a followup on that point about the utility being low but customers are readying themselves i think as an industry weve been waiting for that for a couple quarters now whats that trigger point where you think well start to see or it will cause the line usage to actually start moving its been flattish for now a good few quarters as we ready for it paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp i think its going to be inventory builds across various industries brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 and youre seeing trade finance pickup paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the trade finance flows and the trade flows that we have have been kicking up and kicking up which means at some point people will be building inventories to meet the customer demands ph as we talk to them paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp some of that inventory building has been hampered by trucking and ocean liner and just getting logistics so i think working out some kinks there you could start to see it kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc and do you have any line of sight when you talk to your customers about any easing up of those supply chain constraints as we anticipate that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp getting better but still i have learned a lot more about ports than i ever thought id learn from our customers its getting better but its going to take a while i mean everybody talks about the chip thats well talked about and well known but youre talking about basics and so its getting better but it really comes down to the operations of ports efficiently and the impact of the virus on employees in those ports and having people to work and unload the ships and things like that so its a pretty drilled out sort of analysis they have but the reality is its still constraining but its getting incrementally better but it will take another six months to kind of and most theyre saying at the end of the year it will be better well see that paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp as you think about kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp loan growth and you start modeling it just remember revolver utilization is down close to thats billion brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp from last year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah thats billion alone just for us kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc right yeah right thats the opportunity set is just how quickly could that be a loaded spring right paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah kenneth m usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you very much operator our next question is from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys how are you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp hi gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good paul can you share with us when i look at your average earnings balance sheet in your supplement and you give us the yield of the average earning assets and i think it declined to basis points can you share with us whats the difference between what youre reporting and what youre putting on each quarter of new earning assets is there a basis point difference basis points difference and if we assume some rates dont change when does that gap disappear because what youre putting on is equal to what youre actually earning paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah well again i mean ill talk about when we take our liquidity which again weve got a lot of excess liquidity and we deploy that into a security right were picking up well in the second quarter we picked up on a blended basis between mortgages and treasuries which were roughly purchases we picked up about basis points relative to cash but when you look at a security thats rolling off and being replaced theyre rolling off at sort of basis points and theyre being replaced at basis points now you can do the same math i did it with securities you can do the same math with the loan pick your loan category whether its a card or a commercial loan its going to just depend on the yield bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and coming back i think you pointed out that the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet is still intact basis point parallel shift this leads to about an billion increase in net interest revenue can you share with us what weighs more heavily on that number is it the short end of the curve going up does the of that increase comes from the short end going up versus the long end paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp correct its approximately for the short end gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good okay appreciate it thank you operator and well go to ph charles peabody with portales your line is open q yeah i wanted to focus on your card operations for two reasons one its the area where there seems to be some visibility to loan growth and two because it i think generates about of your bottom line so its a significant mover if im using your line of business data correctly cards as a line of business are on pace to generate somewhere between billion a quarter so somewhere between well close to billion a year am i right in that assumption brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp if youre talking about interest income yeah if you look at the supplement page the billion is the card interest income for the second quarter of but thats q well i was using the net income brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp the net income we dont have a card segment yeah we dont report a card segment because it goes there it goes in the fee line it goes and theres expenses indiscernible q but if you look at your line of business reporting you do have a consumer lending versus deposit and the consumer lending is primarily cards if i understand it correctly bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp no its got mortgage loans and auto loans and its all lending products so lets if youve got a bit of question indiscernible q okay the question is if i assume kind of data in terms of margins in terms of gross yield and i assume high single digit growth in loans in because of the substantial reserve release this year versus what probably will be less next year i see a fairly substantial decline in your card business as a line of business as a profit business and so im trying to get a sense am i right that theres a delay even if the balances pick up theres a delay to the improved profitability of that product line brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp because theres less reserve last year it was hurt by reserve build this year its benefit by reserve releases and next year that benefit comes out thats the companys indiscernible paul m donofrio a chief financial officer bank of america corp and not only that but you have to reserve as youre putting on loans and so you get less benefit day versus day brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah but remember weve got i think somebody asked an earlier question were reserved on loans now basis points higher than where we were cecl day so as loans grow you can eat into that reserve q right and i estimated you probably have about billion to billion of excess reserves in your cards if you go back to day cecl and so youre going to bleed some of that back in over the second half of this year which means you have maybe billion to billion next year lee mcentire a senior vice presidentinvestor relations bank of america corp hey ph charlie so why dont we take this offline and you and i can go through this afterwards i see where youre headed but indisernible q okay yeah ill share my model with you lee because i think its an important hole that has to be filled next year bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2021 lee mcentire a senior vice presidentinvestor relations bank of america corp yeah what id also just add though just while everybody is on the line is just remember our chargeoffs are running significantly lower in addition forget about all the reserving indiscernible q yeah absolutely absolutely lee mcentire a senior vice presidentinvestor relations bank of america corp yeah okay ill get with you after the call q all right thanks operator and it appears we have no further questions ill return the floor to brian moynihan for closing remarks brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well thank you all for joining us once again in the quarter our customers are seeing good growth opportunities and the recovering economy deposits continue to grow billion in the quarter loan balances stabilized and grew on a periodend basis for the quarter even overcoming the ppp runoff asset quality is at 25year percentage loss lows not just dollar amount the solid earnings continued this quarter the important thing is were seeing increased activity by our customer base whether its sales of all the different products whether its the reopening of the branches and more appointments that lead to sales whether its our facetoface meeting or commercial businesses so that holds us in good stead it helps answer the question about how nii grows in the second half of the year and then on top of all that this quarter is the first quarter in many that weve been able to forever that weve been able to go back and actually use excess capital based on our earnings power and our boards discretion so you should expect us to get back in the share buyback game so thank you and we will return that capital to you and we look forward to talking next quarter operator well
