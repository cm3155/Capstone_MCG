earnings call 15apr2024 turning to slide which shows the results for the first quarter the quarter was highlighted by strong ci and consumer loan growth ppnr was a solid million expense control remains a key focus and was evident as adjusted expenses increased only compared to the first quarter of diluted gaap earnings per share were for the quarter if we exclude the additional fdic special assessment adjusted diluted earnings per share were on an adjusted basis mts first quarter results produced an roa and roce of and respectively the cet1 ratio remained strong growing to at the end of the first quarter and tangible book value share grew to next we look a little deeper into the underlying trends that generated our first quarter results please turn to slide taxableequivalent net interest income was billion in the first quarter down from linked quarter the net interest margin was down basis points from the linked quarter the primary drivers for the decrease to the margin were a negative basis points from lower nonaccrual interest and the impact of interest rate swaps a negative basis points from higher liquidity and cash moving into securities negative basis points from a deposit mix and pricing and a positive basis points from all other items including the benefit of asset repricing in the investment portfolio and consumer loans turning to slide to look at the average balance sheet trends average investment securities increased billion to billion reflecting the reinvestment of maturing security balances and a measured shift of a portion of our cash balances into investment securities average interestbearing deposits at the fed increased approximately billion to billion as our decision to have more liquidity on the balance sheet was largely offset by the previously mentioned investment security purchases average loans increased billion or and to billion average deposits decreased million or less than to billion turning to slide to talk about average loans average loans and leases increased to billion compared to the linked quarter solid growth in ci and consumer loans outpaced declines in cre and residential mortgages the growth in ci loans was driven by a combination of increased line utilization in our middle market and dealer business lines combined with new origination activity in equipment finance corporate and institutional and fund banking as we continue to grow existing and new clients loan yields decreased to but increased basis points sequentially when excluding the impact of the cash flow hedges on interest income in our cre portfolio within our consumer portfolio we continue to see the benefit of higher rates on new originations compared to maturing balances with the consumer loans yielding increased basis points to turning to slide our liquidity remains strong at the end of the first quarter investment securities and cash including cash out at the fed totaled billion representing of total assets average investment securities grew billion reflecting the reinvestment of maturing securities and a shift of a portion of our cash balances into securities the yield on investment securities increased basis points to as the yield on new purchases exceeded the yield on maturing securities the duration of the securities portfolio at the end of the quarter was years and the unrealized pretax loss on the availableforsale portfolio was only million turning to slide we continue to focus on growing customer deposits and were pleased with the stabilization of our deposit balances and pricing average total deposits declined million less than to billion while the average customer deposits increased sequentially we saw average deposit growth in institutional mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 services and wealth management relatively stable deposits within commercial and a modest decline in the retail bank this growth allowed us to roll off some of our brokerage cds average demand deposits declined billion partially impacted by seasonal deposit declines in commercial and business banking the shift towards higheryielding products continued during the quarter but at a much slowed meaningfully the mix average of noninterestbearing deposit was of total deposits largely unchanged from last quarter excluding broker deposits noninterestbearing deposit mix in the first quarter was encouragingly we saw the pace of deposit cost increases slow through the quarter with the cost of interest bearing deposits increasing basis points to this represents the smallest quarterly increase since the start of the tightening in early our core nonmaturity deposit costs increased only basis point sequentially continuing on slide noninterest income was million up slightly from the linked quarter mt normally receives an annual distribution from bayview lending group during the first quarter of the year this distribution was million in compared to million last year excluding the bayview distribution noninterest income declined million sequentially the decrease was largely driven by lower commercial mortgage banking revenues and syndication fees reflected in our other revenues from operations both of these fee items posted strong fourth quarter results recall that last years first quarter included million of fee income from cit prior to the sale in april turning to slide we continue to focus on controlling expenses noninterest expenses were billion this years first quarter and last years fourth quarter each had incremental fdic special assessments amounting to million and million respectively excluding the special assessment adjusted noninterest expense increased by million or compared to last years first quarter on a similar basis adjusted noninterest expense increased ph million or from the linked quarter this increase was largely driven by an approximate million of seasonal higher compensation costs included in the first quarter this figure is unchanged from last years first quarter as usual we expect those seasonal factors to decline significantly as we enter the second quarter the adjusted efficiency ratio was compared to in the fourth quarter next lets turn to slide for credit net chargeoffs for the quarter totaled million or basis points down from basis points in the linked quarter cre net chargeoffs declined meaningfully due to the resolution of three officerelated credits in last years fourth quarter the two largest chargeoffs were previously criticized ci loans and amounted to approximately million total one credit was a nonautomotive dealer and the other was in the services industry nonaccrual loans increased by million to billion sic billion the nonaccrual ratio increased basis points to this was largely driven by an increase in ci and cre healthcare nonaccrual loans loans to days past due declined sequentially across each portfolio in the first quarter we recorded a provision of million compared to the net chargeoffs of million this resulted in an allowance build of million and increased the allowancetoloan ratio by basis points to the current build primarily reflects a deterioration in the performance of loans to certain commercial borrowers including nonautomotive dealers and healthcare facilities as well as growth in some sectors of mt ci and consumer loan portfolios mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 please turn to slide when we file our form 10q in a few weeks we estimate that the level of criticized loans will be billion compared to billion at the end of december ci criticized loans increased million while cre criticized loans decreased million with declines in both permanent and construction slide provides additional detail on ci criticized balances total ci criticized balances increased million majority of that increase is concentrated within dealer and manufacturing industries we are seeing areas of pressure particularly in certain businesses that may be more acutely impacted by the lag effects of higher rates for those impacted by reduced largeticket consumer discretionary spending or a shift in spending on goods to services for example we saw an uptick in criticized loans to our nonauto dealer industries as higher rates have impacted largeticket discretionary consumer spend and earlier coviddriven buying saturated demand for these types of purchases slide includes detail on cre criticized balances total cre criticized balances decreased million from the last quarter the decline is across most property types though we did not see an increase in office and healthcare criticized we are seeing improvements in occupancy and staffing within healthcare but reimbursement rate improvement has been uneven resulting in modest net increase in criticized balances within the portfolio last quarter we noted an upcoming review of the construction portfolio over of that review has been completed and im pleased to note that that review resulted in limited incremental downgrades of construction loans into criticized the remainder of the review generally consists of smaller balance loans but we would not expect the outcome of the remainder of that review to be significantly different than the portion already completed turning to slide for capital mts cet1 ratio at the end of the first quarter was an estimated sic compared to at the end of the fourth quarter the increase was due in part to the continued pause in repurchasing shares combined with continued strong capital generation at the end of the quarter the negative aoci impact on cet1 ratio from the afs securities and pensionrelated components will be approximately basis points now turning to slide for the outlook the economy continues to perform well and the labor market remains strong despite the challenges faced by firms and consumers the economic outlook that we discussed on the january earnings call remains unchanged shifting to earnings the outlook is largely unchanged from our update in march with an upward bias to our nii outlook for nii recall that the outlook we provided in january considered a range of rate cut scenarios from six cuts to three cuts as the forward curve has settled closer to two cuts we expect nii to be billion with possible upside our outlook for fees and expenses is unchanged the expense outlook excludes incremental fdic special assessment incurred in the first quarter we continue to expect net chargeoffs for the full year to be near the basis points the allowance level will be dependent on many factors including changes in the macroeconomic outlook portfolio mix and underlying asset quality our outlook for the tax rate of to excludes discrete tax benefit in the first quarter finally as it relates to capital our capital coupled with our limited investment security marks has been a clear differentiator for mt we take our responsibility to manage our shareholders capital very seriously and return more when it is appropriate to do that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 our businesses are performing well and we are growing new relationships each and every day while the economic uncertainty is improving our share repurchases remain on hold we plan to reassess repurchases after the second quarter and will consider a range of factors including the macroeconomic environment the banks capital generation results from the stress test the level of commercial real estate loans and overall asset quality that said we continue to use our capital for organic growth and growing new customer relationships buybacks have always been part of our core capital distribution strategy and will again in the future in the meantime our strong balance sheet will continue to differentiate us with our clients communities regulators investors and rating agencies to conclude on slide our results underscore an optimistic investment thesis while economic uncertainty remains high that is when mt has historically outperformed its peers mt has always been a purposedriven organization with a successful business model that benefits all stakeholders including shareholder we have a long track record of credit outperforming through all economic cycles while growing within the markets we serve we remain focused on shareholder returns and consistent dividend growth finally we are a disciplined acquirer and prudent steward of shareholder capital now lets open up the call question and answer section operator at this time we will open the floor for questions operator instructions our first question will come from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc daryl can you unpack the nii guidance for us in terms of the puts and takes in a higherforlonger rate environment i mean it looks like nib deposits are holding up well youre moving some of the liquidity into high yielding securities so is the billion an easy bar to hit if we only get two cuts and what would that look like if we dont get any rate cuts this year daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 yeah so let me start with the latter part first manan thanks for the question we are really pretty neutral to interest rates right now so whether we get two cuts three cuts or we get no cuts were going to probably pretty much be pretty comfortable with billion plus in that range i think because of the size of the balance sheet we had this quarter we were a little bit heavy with liquidity and a margin of i think for the most part our margin has bottomed out this year and well probably be in the mid to high3 the rest of the year but well probably have a little smaller balance sheet maybe billion or billion shorter than that but we feel really good about it if you look at how things are playing out our deposits the real value of our deposit franchise i think came out really strong this quarter i mean our core deposits hardly budged an increasing of interest rates we still saw some growth in our retail cds which kind of drove the increase but other than that core deposits were flat from a cost perspective and if you look on the asset side of the equation were getting nice reactivity both on our consumer loans our consumer loans are increasing nicely in auto rv and heloc and all those are contributing positively and then as we put money to work in the investment securities portfolio i know its not as high as what it is at the fed but as we help manage our sensitivities were going to have some really nice repricing on our investment portfolio were up basis points we could easily do that for the next couple of quarters plus throughout the year so i think we feel pretty good about nii going forward right now manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc did you mention what duration youre putting on on the securities book daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so the purchases we did this quarter we basically did three chunks of securities and the way we look at it is trying to keep our convexity flat so weve been purchasing treasuries and cmbs which basically has positive convexity coupled with some low convex mbs together so the yields have been weve been getting in the first quarter so yield duration at about a little over three years from that perspective where rates are today now you can probably easily add another to basis points higher yield from that so as we continue to do the same thing we did in the first quarter and the second quarter well probably get some more uplift manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats really helpful and then maybe a quick followup on the liquidity side cash as a percentage of assets is up another basis points or so this quarter can you talk about like the rationale for continuing to ratchet up that liquidity level is it a cre exposure is it partly some of the stress we saw in the market last quarter so maybe if you can talk about what the right level of liquidity is given the current credit environment daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp it was the latter anytime theres any scare in the industry were going to be conservative thats just who we are were going to make sure we take care of the company has strong capital and a lot of liquidity and thats first and foremost i would say were comfortable as we kind of let some of this excess liquidity come out of our balance mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 sheet actually have it go down to maybe billion billion at the fed ballpark over as we kind of go throughout the year from that perspective so it will come down or any other stresses that hit our industry manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question will come from john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey john john pancari q analyst evercore isi back to the balance hey daryl back to the balance sheet trends ci loans you have been relatively constructive in your commentary there and the growth youre seeing you cited better line utilization can you maybe elaborate there a little bit where are you seeing demand and whats your outlook there on that front or where youre going to actually see some growth in the coming quarters daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so if you look at growth it was actually broadbased we had really good growth in many sectors so if you look at our dealer financial services area just the auto floor planning is funding up so you had increased utilization there our middle market business was strong and actually had increases in that space corporate and institutional was also up fund banking was up our equipment leasing was higher as well as mortgage warehouse so those were the businesses that drove it if you look at the regions we operate in community bank regions twothirds of our community bank regions now are growing positively the highlights were in massachusetts new jersey philadelphia and western new york were kind of the drivers where the growth came from john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay great thanks daryl and then on the credit front its good to see the commercial real estate nonaccruals down in the quarter what are you seeing on the cre front in terms of npa inflows are you seeing a slowing or is that somewhat impacted by an increase in loan modifications and then just separately on the ci front i know you noted some higher nonaccruals there just what are you seeing on that front thats driving the adding stress mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes so on the cre front i think we saw really good performance this quarter one quarter doesnt make a trend yet but it was a positive quarter we had our criticized numbers come down still had healthcare and office go up a little bit but overall i think were seeing that stabilize we did i talked about it in the prepared remarks we did go through that construction review we got through of the construction review we only had million change in criticized we have a little bit to go and well have very nominal increase there so getting through that construction book was huge it was i think billion in size we went through so that was a really good review well continue to monitor it obviously office and healthcare are more of the troubled sectors and those where we will work with over time but our teams are working with our customers each and every day were trying to get out in front of working with them to make sure we can help them through any stress that we have and i think we feel pretty good just going forward with that so definitely not out of the woods with cre but i think were feeling that were having some positive trends as far as ci goes to be honest with you we had two really credits one was a nonauto dealer and nonauto dealer was stressed a little bit with higher interest rates it was marine dealers such that a lot of activity in the boats was coming down didnt have as much demand there and we just basically had to put a specific reserve on that and take a charge off in that sector and the other one that came through was a healthcare credit and those were the two largest ci credits that came through that really impacted the numbers so it wasnt for those you probably wouldnt have noticed anything from a chargeoff perspective or provision john pancari q analyst evercore isi thanks daryl if i can ask just one more on the credit front tied to that your criticized loans do trend above your peer levels but is there a degree of conservativeness in there in terms of i guess how you treat your recourse agreement as part of cre and elsewhere is there something in the way youre doing your internal risk ratings that may influence your criticized levels were getting a fair amount of incomings regarding that daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so we have had a long history of running with a higher level of criticized we do that intentionally because we want to work with our clients because if we work with our clients and get them through these stress times theyre very loyal to our company its the right things for our communities and all of that so thats first and foremost i would say we just tend to be a conservative company im on the financial side so im conservative with capital and liquidity you have mike todaro and bob our chief credit officer theyre conservative on the credit side so its just how we run and operate the bank were going to do the right things and try to work with our customers to get through issues when we customers are not supportive in getting through issues thats when we might try to sell some credits but thats usually few and far between but our history is to work with them mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 we find that working with our clients over the longterm produces less losses better capital preservation and better for both shareholders as well as us as a company and all that so thats how were going to continue to operate john pancari q analyst evercore isi okay thanks daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc so i guess a question on commercial real estate youve done a lot of work over the last year deep diving on the portfolio if we think about i think the stress in the market and its been the wet blanket on your stock is around what higher rates could mean on commercial real estate risk give us a sense of when you look at sensitivity be it loantovalue discounted sort of debt service coverage ratios if we dont get any rate cuts for the next two years does that and the economy and thats because the economy is doing fairly well does that lead to worse outcomes just because rates are higher like give us a sense of no rate cuts elevated yield curve what the sensitivity to that portfolio is in terms of credit losses daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah if you dont mind ebrahim im going to pivot a little bit because we actually ran a scenario last quarter and stressed our cre portfolio up basis points of what impact that might have for us so i mean if you look at it from that perspective it really depends on what level of rates are going higher so lets just assume right now its the fed rates the shortterm rates if you look at our cre portfolio the vast majority of the cre portfolio is fixed rate either a fixed rate loan or they synthetically have swaps that have it fixed so only floats mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 if you look at going up basis points we see really very minimal impact on the portfolio maybe at most approximately million might go into criticized they fall below the debt service coverage ratio thats what we had from that if you look at the ci book ci book billion is all floating now the vast majority of the ci book has debt service coverage ratios well over and very strong but if you look at a subset of the leverage book that we have in there thats closer to billion we call them leverage but when we put them on they were leveraged about half of those arent even levered anymore because of their performance so youre really only looking at about half of that it is really pure levered loans and when you look at those levered loans coming through and stress them basis points its a minimal impact for us a couple hundred million dollars from criticized now if you go to the longer end of the curve and in longer end of the curve lets say or year goes up basis points that really impacts more our construction book because you need to have takeouts there and from that perspective its going to its just whats happening now people are going shorter they arent going years theyre going years try to get placement and all that so all that being said we think its very manageable if rates even go up basis points that we can get through and not have a significant impact on our credit performance ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc that is good color thanks for talking through and then one question in terms of buybacks you have a lot of excess capital you called out four things macro overall asset quality stress test results and the level of cre if the first three are okay and fastforward to july no issues on the first three is there something around the level of cre that we should be mindful of when we think about potential for buybacks getting started in the back half of the year daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so theres actually five so let me go through them again you might have missed it when i was going through it so macroeconomic ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc my apologies daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thats all right no problem macroeconomic environment banks capital generation results from the stress test the level of cre and then overall asset quality i would say were going to evaluate those at the end of second quarter from that perspective theres still a lot of uncertainty in the marketplace and we just want to be good stewards of our capital the capital is not going anywhere and this capital is for our investors its going to come to the investors sooner or later its just a matter of when we feel comfortable right now we just dont want to make sure that now is the right time and we can basically put it over but its not going anywhere mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 i would feel that if we did decide and im not saying we are but if we did decide i would say wed probably start off modestly and probably keep 11plus cet1 ratio and then kind of see how that goes but right now what i can tell you is were going to review it at our earnings call three months from now and well let you know how we feel about share repurchase at that point in time and then well go from there but its not going anywhere the investors its core to who we are we buy back stock when we dont deploy in acquisitions and thats what were going to do ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yes operator thank you our next question comes from ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc daryl i was wondering if you can elaborate a little bit more on deposits so i think typically mt you see a little bit of a seasonal decline in the first q and i think quarter had like a weird ending date with a holiday and payroll but really interesting to see your ddas and interestbearing up at period end versus the averages can you talk about your flows what youre seeing and how that dynamic is changing with the higherforlonger environment daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp ken its really all around trying to make sure we grow our core deposits and to be honest with you some of our businesses i mentioned it in the prepared remarks but in our trust businesses theyre growing nicely again a lot of traction and we had some nice wins in those businesses that added to our deposits in the second half of the first quarter early part of the second quarter so we have a lot of momentum in that business and doing really well i cant be more pleased though with the other areas our commercial bank is really focused on growing deposits as well as well as the retail bank so i mean everybody is focused on doing the right thing and thats where we are our bread and butter is really getting the operating account and were really good at that and once we get them they tend not to leave us so were happy with that as we move forward mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it great and one question on the loan side you talked about the benefit from securities yields grinding higher can you give us any color on your fixed rate loan repricing and what that looks like over the next year or two daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so if you look at the yields on the give you a couple of examples so lets just look at auto and rv and give you examples so if you look at it on a spread basis our spreads are higher and this is to our marginal cost of funds up basis points in auto and basis points in rv but when you look at the yields that were getting incrementally versus whats rolling off were getting a basis point higher yields in auto and basis point higher yield in rv so thats really whats moving the yields in the consumer loan portfolios as an example does that help ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc it does and are those the two books that are the majority of where youll get that benefit over the next year or two daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp i would say for the other businesses its competitive in middle market but some of our other businesses that were in i think were getting a little bit higher spreads and yields overall if you look at some of the businesses so i think overall we feel pretty good about that and then on the securities portfolio thats going to reprice nicely i talked a little bit with that with manan but with what we have maturing on the securities portfolio and what we plan to buy and repurchase we could easily go up 20plus basis points in the next couple of quarters in that whole yield on that portfolio ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc great thanks daryl operator thank you our next question will come from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning daryl daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 i wanted to start i appreciate all the comments on what the cre portfolio could do under different stress scenarios looking forward but if we stay with what actually happened this quarter i know you guys have roughly billion coming due this year what came do in the first quarter and walk us through how did it play out what percent of these refinance what paid off or did you have to extend because they couldnt refinance could you just give us some color on what actually happened this quarter in the portfolio daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i can do that i think we had about billion mature in the first quarter out of that billion i would say of it was basically extended and out of that was extended there was about of that was an upgrade we had i think another percent maybe actually paid off and then we have the residual that were working through right now and thats going to either would be extended out or paid off so very little incremental went into criticized small portion but for the most part our teams are working very closely but that was the impact of the maturities we had for the first quarter we hope that plays out through the rest of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and when you say extended do you mean refinanced or they werent in a position to refinance so you gave them another year as an example daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so typically when we extend you always try to get more equity and more recourse from the customer so fees wanting to extend out a year were going to try to rightsize the debt service coverage ratio and theyll put more equity in or give us more tangible assets to protect us as we move forward is kind of how really the negotiation goes and typically we extend anywhere from six months to a year after ph willing to support it steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thanks and then just on the margin as i heard you earlier said you thought nim would be mid to high3 for the rest of the year but its funny when you look at deposit cost its slowed materially it seems youre fairly close to market and when i look at the components of earning assets right loan yield cis coming in way above that youve already outlined securities coming in higher why is the outlook not more robust for nim it just seems like youre there on the deposit side you have a lot of room for earning assets to reset higher just curious whats on the other side of this thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah im trying to give you the best color that i can give you with what i know but at the end of the day the biggest factor and its been this way my whole career in asset liability management how deposits behave especially the nonmaturity deposits really drives your interest rate sensitivity and while its slowing in the commercial were still going to see growth in the retail cd book just because youre over so youre going to have that mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 now to offset that we are paying off some of our brokered deposits which is a good guy to counteract some of that but this disintermediation piece is just really hard to model and we put our best guess out there what we think its going to do there obviously we could outperform but id much rather under promise and over deliver right now steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it it sounds like youre being conservative okay thanks for taking my questions daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank please go ahead matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc morning i was hoping you could daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp hey matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc talk about the recent action by sp to lower your ratings to or a negative outlook there was no rating change but just a negative outlook i mean obviously capital strong earnings strong liquidity strong so a lot of those boxes are checked but i do think one of the things they flagged with the cre concentration but so maybe just address that topic overall and how you think you can alleviate some of their concerns thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so matt we actively meet with all of our rating agencies all four of them on a very frequent basis sp did put us on negative outlook but i think we feel very comfortable that that wont result in a downgrade we think we have a good handle on both our cre exposure and the amount of criticized that we have and what were working towards right now so i think we feel that where weve got strategies in place to over time get that to be less of a risk in the balance sheet from a credit perspective but rating agencies are one constituency its an important constituency we also have to deal with our other constituencies as well too but were all doing the right things we come to work every day and im excited to be working with the professionals that we have in our commercial and credit teams theyre working their asses off each and every day i answered the call question earlier about going through the billion maturities we had in the first quarter weve really worked through almost all of those to fruition and had very minimal impact as we move forward were going to continue to just grind it out and do a good job and well just see how things play out mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just separately on the trust fees you talked about them being a driver going forward maybe just like frame how much equities drive that business whats ph newer drivers are because obviously like the underlying trends are a little tricky to see because yearoveryear as you mentioned you had a sale linked quarter i think theres some seasonality that maybe with a drag from like annuity sales or something but just talk about some of the underlying drivers of that business and what gives you confidence that being a key driver of fees this year daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i mean if you look at that business and i think our disclosures are a lot easier to understand now as we move forward with our change of segments that come out on quarter end youll be able to track our business performances there but the ics business specifically we have a little over different product services that they offer some of them are fee based some of them are fees and fundingbased oriented examples would be escrow ma activity from that some of it can be lumpy at times it can go back and forth but just getting in the flow in that business and just doing a good job and good reputation jen who runs this business her and team theyve built a really great reputation and really have done a good job growing this space nicely over the last couple of years and were investing in this space we think its a good business core business for us and were really happy to have it and well continue to focus on it and i think you see some of the benefits like you saw in the first quarter hopefully play out throughout future quarters for us matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from brian foran with autonomous please go ahead brian foran q analyst autonomous research hi i just wanted to follow up on the likely staying at or above that even if you restart buybacks this year is there any thoughts you can give on framing is that a moment in time given the five factors you cite versus is that maybe where the new normal is trending just kind of any thought on when we look at this i guess ultimately how much of it is excess capital and how much is the new normal for running the business daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah brian i think we need to kind of see where our stress capital buffer comes out but i mean at the end of the day were going to be really conservative we are in uncertain times risky times so we are just going to be a little bit more cautious typically i would say long term our average might be lower than that but just starting the mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 share repurchase i think would be a significant change to be honest with you as we move forward so not saying thats going to happen but if it does happen were going to be very modest as we started out brian foran q analyst autonomous research and then maybe i could ask the same question i think you noted on cash billion at the end of the year as a potential landing spot again is that still in excess cash position in your mind or is that kind of more of a normal cash position you see going forward any thoughts on the level of excess liquidity right now daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so theres a new liquidity proposal thats supposed to come out from the regulators probably in the next quarter or so so well see whats in there weve done some of our own modeling the treasury team has and when you look at what we need from an operating basis whats the fluctuations that we have within our businesses our minimum is probably billion so we would operate with a cushion over that but we are in no way going to come near that in the near future were going to be much more conservative than that as we move forward brian foran q analyst autonomous research thank you thank you for taking both daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question comes from peter winter with da davidson please go ahead peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning i was wondering theres been so much focus on commercial real estate so i guess i was a little bit surprised by the increase in criticized loans on the ci side im just wondering do you feel like were in this is in early stages of more ci just given that were in a higherforlonger rate environment daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so for us its really three primary industries that are kind of the bigger themes that we see within our book right now the nonauto dealer so like rv and marine that has some specific items where some of those dealers build up inventory postcovid in and had to flush that inventory and losses so that hurt their operating performance coupled with higher rates they have lower discretionary spend in those spaces as well so they have some issues there healthcare we talked about as far as healthcare goes i think its getting a little bit better from an occupancy perspective i think that and product but still reimbursement rates are lumpy staffing might be getting a little bit better there but thats still a stressful place from that perspective mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 and the other theme that we would have is more in trucking and freight during covid we increased a lot of our clients increased capacity because there are a lot of things that needed to be shipped now theyre stuck with that excess capacity theyre just moving a lot less freight so their operating performance is just a little bit lower so those besides the oneoffs that i talked about earlier those are probably the three underlying themes i would say within the ci book that i would be willing to discuss peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay and then just separately daryl you had said at the conference youre looking to lower the cre as a percent of capital and reserves to about how long do you think it will take to get there and is that one of the i know you listed five things about starting up the buyback but how important is that in terms of the overall theme of starting buybacks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp its one of the five themes its important but were i mean you have to remember we started when we were what in the yeah four years ago we started we were at so i mean a tremendous progress weve made over the last three year last four years i pretty much expect that were going to be in the mid to low by the end of the year on the pace that were going right now peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay thanks daryl operator thank you our next question will come from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp good morning frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co wondering if you can daryl just in terms of the criticized balances the reduction in cre overall curious if you can just point to any specific driver there i think this is the second quarter in a row where youve seen a reduction in criticized balances is it just occupancy is better and debt service coverage better is it stuff moving maybe into modification just any sort of like specific driver in terms of the last couple of quarters seeing those balances move lower daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 yeah i mean in the cre portfolio with the exception of office and healthcare the operating performance of the cre businesses are performing well some of them are stressed just because of higher rates but as we continue to work with our clients going through we feel very good that were going to work through the initiatives its one that we said earlier in other calls frank but our customers work with us and put capital in and were definitely seeing all of our customers our sponsors really support these projects i think it really starts with client selection and we have really good client selection that really helps win the day for us so i think youre just seeing that commitment come through and were working really closely with them and i think thats really important as we move forward so i think we will continue to work through this but definitely feel that cre is very manageable and well continue to address that frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a followup on the expense side i know even though you have limited expense growth baked in for this year you do have some investments you guys are focused on and just wondering if given the stronger nii outlook driven by rates if you could potentially foresee accelerating some of that investment in thanks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i would tell you sometimes you can only do so much in a company at once we got six major projects were working on right now in the company were all making really good progress in these six major projects and theyre going as fast as they can go to be honest with you with what were doing i cant imagine that we would push them to go faster or if we try to start up another project theres just a lot of change going on in the company and i think were just going to be conservative get these things across the finish line and then start up other ones as we move forward frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay thanks for the color daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp thanks frank operator thank you our next question will come from gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning this is thomas leddy calling on behalf of gerard given the jump in criticized loans in the quarter and the fact that you guys tend to historically carry a little bit more than peers just curious how are the criticized levels today compared to where they were in the and then peaks daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp im going to see if i have a friend here to help me with that i dont have that here hold on a second tom mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so back in it was more ill just let john talk about it john is our corporate controller he was here back then ill let him talk about it i dont know that john r taylor a executive vice president controller mt bank corp yeah ill just say that obviously was more of a residential mortgagetype issue so we dont criticize per se we ph more monitor delinquencies on the residential side there were pockets of criticized so they did rise i dont have those numbers at my disposal but these numbers on the commercial side are higher than what they would have been back then thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you thats helpful and then just a quick followup with the increase in criticized ci loans reported today do you guys still feel pretty confident that you can maintain mts historical track record of outperformance in terms of credit losses relative to peers daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah i think we do we have a longterm history of performing in good times and stressed times and i think we will continue to do really well and perform and all that will come to fruition i mean i couldnt be more pleased with how hard everybody is working and the success that were making we have a ways to go but you kind of see that we have a path and how were going to get through that and i have no doubt in my mind that we will get through this positively and still have really good credit performance thomas leddy q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great thats helpful thanks for taking my questions daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah operator thank you our next question will come from christopher spahr with wells fargo please go ahead christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning so two questions first is just reconciling your outlook for the nim and the increase in long term borrowings that we saw both at end of period on an average basis this quarter mt bank corp mtb corrected transcript q1 earnings call 15apr2024 daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp so we basically did some federal home loan bank advances back closer to when new york community was happening and then we did an unsecured issuance in the month of march that will carry through i think for the rest of the year our focus is really on growing customer deposits and paying down noncustomer funding thats really what were really focused on you might see us do some more securitization weve done securitizations now in our equipment leasing business as well as our auto business thats something that could possibly play out down the road but we will prudently grow customer deposits as much as possible and then were going to work and try to work down our broker deposits and work down our federal home loan bank advances and put it into more other types of funding like securitizations if we need to from that perspective that way we have more capacity if and when theres another stress period we will always want to keep it open in case something happens so we can fund if we have to christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay so thanks and then so my followup is just when i look at the schedule on slide the criticized loans and see that motor vehicle i dont know rvs kind of had a huge spike in criticized and then in response to kens question though you talked about the increase in yields and highlighting the increase in yield so how do you reconcile the issue of just some of these portfolios under more weakness and yet youre kind of also highlighting youre getting greater yields i mean i would think to kind of fight against each other thank you daryl n bible a senior executive vice president chief financial officer mt bank corp yeah so its two different businesses so the stress is in the floor planning business for the nonauto so rv and marine so thats floor planning thats where the stress is we also are in the indirect business for rv just like you have indirect auto you have indirect rv and thats where were getting the yield pickup on the consumer loan portfolio so we have a very primebased consumer loan credit box if you look at the average fico score that we have in that portfolio its so its pretty pristine in there and we feel good about that performance of that portfolio christopher spahr q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator thank you at this time i will now turn the call back to our speakers for additional or closing remarks brian klock executive vice president headmarkets investor relations mt bank corp thanks todd and again
