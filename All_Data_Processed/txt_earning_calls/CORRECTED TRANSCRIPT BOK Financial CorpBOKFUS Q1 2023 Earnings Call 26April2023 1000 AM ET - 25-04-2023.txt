corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 good morning thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials first quarter financial results starting on slide first quarter net income was million or per diluted share the strong results of the first quarter continued the earnings momentum we developed throughout this quarter was the second highest preprovision net revenue in our history and would have been the highest absent the extraordinary market volatility impacting the net mortgage servicing results the strong financial results in the first quarter are a testament to our diverse business model strong operating geographies and disciplined approach to risk management that has long been critical to our ability to sustain success our peerleading tangible capital ratio carried with our balance sheet liquidity have served us well over the last days with the disruption in our sector the disruptions and almost unprecedented level of rate volatility in the quarter have demonstrated our ability to both manage critical risk well while also continuing to post strong financial results for our shareholders the first quarter showed sustained revenue in our noninterest income businesses continued loan growth and an efficiency ratio below while no bank can be totally immune from the macro economy we believe this is precisely the environment that positively differentiates our diversified business model robust risk management framework and strong financial performance our interest rate liquidity and credit risk management are strong and we remain focused on increasing top line revenue in the exceptional growth markets we had very strong financial results during the first quarter that were proud to discuss but today well break our prepared comments in two sections in the first section well focus on many of the key metrics around capital liquidity and deposit diversity that have been in the focus for the markets over the last days in the second section we will focus on the core results for the quarter which was the second best preprovision net revenue quarter in bokfs history we want to address the issues that are top of mind early so that the good financial results do not get lost in the noise of the recent market disruptions before marty walks us through the metrics that are top of mind for you id like to make a few broader comments the failures of silicon valley bank and signature bank were idiosyncratic and do not represent broad weakness in the banking sector banks are better capitalized than at any time in my banking career regional banks specifically pay an important role in our communities and play a broad role in our business and economic activity that cannot be filled by the largest us banks at bok financial we take managing interest rate liquidity and credit risk seriously and those in risk management roles rightfully create natural tension with those in risk taking roles to ensure the proper balance exist we ended the quarter with a neutral interest rate risk posture a loanto deposit ratio of less than compared to a prepandemic loantodeposit mean in the range and high capital levels in fact as of december our tangible common equity inclusive of tax effective unrealized securities net losses placed us in the top of publicly traded bank with assets greater than billion by that measure we ended the first quarter with an adjusted ratio of versus last quarter while liquidity and rate risk have come to the forefront managing credit risk is also a core competency we are the largest traditional bank that did not participate in tarp during the financial crisis because of our disciplined approach to credit risk management in good times we have remained disciplined to the same credit fairway that allowed us to meaningfully outperform the last time there was a credit cycle we have an internal limit of of tier capital and reserves for our commercial real estate exposure that we take seriously while our asset quality levels including net chargeoffs potential problem loans and nonperforming loans remained near historic lows we are building a bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 strong combined reserve for credit losses at our earnings performance is even more impressive considering our current earnings include meaningful provision expense finally our diverse business model is unique for a bank our size while the market focused on net interest revenue and related margins our operating revenue is very diverse and is a big reason for both the resiliency of our earnings and a key driver of growth for the company i will now turn the call over to marty to discuss key aspects of our liquidity and capital before we review the first quarter results martin e grunst executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp thanks stacy recent events have focused the market on a couple of specific metrics within capital and liquidity and i will cover our position on each within capital that metric is tangible common equity adjusted to include unrealized net losses and held to maturity securities that is in addition to unrealized net losses on available for sale securities that are already captured in the tce ratio the chart on slide shows our december adjusted tce versus that same metric for the top banks in the us at bokf level was higher than of those largest banks and notably higher than each of the four largest banks this level of capital strength which is easy to see by investors and depositors alike has made our recent discussions with clients and prospects relatively easy that same metric for bokf as of march was which will compare favorably to march levels of peers and very large banks our strong tce levels are the result of our disciplined approach to risk management across the organization but in particular within the investment portfolio we monitor and limit tce exposure to market rate increases we maintain a relatively short duration securities portfolio which increases flexibility when rates increase slide shows the duration of both our afs and htm securities and the low level of extension risk in and we understood that a portion of covid era deposit growth was not permanent and reflected that back in the size of our portfolio the vast majority of our securities are us government agency mortgage backed and can be pledged to secured borrowing sources which supports liquidity i will note that we actually have billion of securities with an unrealized gain in our afs portfolio mostly due to our repositioning of the balance sheet in q4 of moving to liquidity our loantodeposit ratio ended the quarter at which is strong relative to peers and our own history standing behind the ratio is a diverse deposit franchise as demonstrated on slide even within our larger industry vertical the largest single industry concentration is energy at only of total deposits corporate banking represents many industries all more granular than that the uninsured deposit metric has received new attention across the industry and slide shows important context for our level on the surface our uninsured deposits totaled as of march however an important adjustment needs to be made to that metric to make it more meaningful it is appropriate to adjust for collateralized deposits since those are effectively no different than insured deposits municipalities native american tribes and certain trustrelated deposits are all required to be collateralized relative to our asset size all three of those are large business segments for us and result in aggregate collateralized deposit balances of billion or of total deposits bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 with that adjustment our effectively uninsured level is billion or of total deposits the next liquidity assessment that is commonly being made is to compare available liquidity sources versus that net effectively uninsured deposit number slide shows our available liquidity from collateralized sources as a subtotal of billion and then a grand total of billion including fed funds line both those figures exceed the effectively uninsured deposit total of billion which is one more way to conclude that our liquidity position is indeed strong three pieces of context on that slide first the number we show under the federal reserves new btfp program represents the incremental secured borrowing capacity we would be able to produce due to the favorable collateral haircuts if we were to move security collateral from fhlb into the btfp program second the secured borrowing capacity we show for unpledged loans reflects the net borrowing capacity we would get after applying collateral haircuts to those specific loan categories and third our wealth management business has billion of customer investments held in money market mutual funds which are not on our balance sheet we believe a large portion of this could be attracted onto our balance sheet albeit at a market rate and in some cases with a form of insurance enhancement the net result of the disruptive march events to our deposit portfolio was not significant total deposit attrition in q1 of was the same amount as in q4 of and generally consistent with our guidance provided in january for the subset of customers who inquired about how well prepared bokf is for the present circumstances the discussions were made very easy by the strong message we have to share when i talk about our outlook you will notice that our forwardlooking guidance on late loantodeposit ratio has not changed lastly i will note that our wholesale borrowing activity during the quarter was all businessasusual activity for us no usage of the federal reserve either the new program or otherwise we have increased usage of fhlb although it was still lower than what is historically normal for us now lets move to our performance in the quarter we delivered solid financial results with earnings per share of and net income of million periodend loan growth was million and asset quality remains very strong and wellpositioned for potential headwinds now i will turn the call over to marc to talk more about the loan growth and credit trends marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks marty turning to slide periodend loans were billion or up in the quarter total ci loans were relatively flat with mix shifts favoring healthcare and services total ci loans have increased billion or yearoveryear with growth across all sectors commercial real estate loans increased million or linked quarter and have increased million or yearoveryear this effectively returns those balances to their level after experiencing significant pay down activity in the annual increase was primarily driven from loans secured by multifamily residential properties and industrial facilities unfunded commercial real estate commitments decreased linked quarter we have an internal limit of of tier capital and reserve to total cre commitment and were presently at the upper limit of that range we do expect continued growth in outstanding cre balances as construction loans fund up as of march cre balances represented of total outstanding loan balances a ratio well below our peer healthcare balances increased by million or in the quarter and have grown million or yearoveryear primarily driven by our senior housing sector healthcare sector loans represented of total loans at quarterend bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 energy balances decreased million or linked quarter and have increased million or yearover year with periodend balances representing of total periodend loan combined services and general business loans our core ci loans relatively flat linked quarter with a yearover year growth of million or these combined categories represent of our total loan portfolio unfunded commitments in these categories fell slightly linked quarter with utilization rates up slightly and utilization rates continued to run below precovid levels so we have capacity to generate balanced growth apart from any new customer acquisition yearoveryear loans have grown billion or excluding ppp loans q1 extends the linked quarter loan growth to six consecutive quarters although we dont expect loan growth to continue at this pace we do believe we have the momentum to drive continued growth in the loan portfolio throughout consistent with our guidance unless the macro economy negatively impacts borrower sentiment turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio and well below historical norms and prepandemic levels nonperforming assets excluding those guaranteed by us government agencies decreased million this quarter nonaccrual loans decreased million and repossessed assets fell million the level of uncertainty in the economic outlook of our reasonable and supportable forecast remained high and key economic factors were less favorable to economic growth across all scenarios including wti oil prices and projected commercial real estate vacancy rates those combined economic factors supported a billion credit loss provision for the quarter with the ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate thats substantially less than our peer and a history of outperformance during past credit cycle we believe we are wellpositioned should an economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead the markets are more focused on the office segment of real estate given the recent trends in workforce preferences though it remains an open question as to whether that will be sustained as employers continue to require more time in the physical office our maturities are generally ratable over the next three to four years and we always have a minimum option if the markets are not conducive to longterm permanent financing the average loantovalue ratios in the office space are sub65 along with average cash flow coverage in excess of times based on our most recent semiannual review at the end of net chargeoffs were less than million for the first quarter and have averaged basis points over the last months far below our historic loss range of to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to continue to be low the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarterend we have noticed many analysts are not using the combined allowance when evaluating strength of loan loss reserves the total combined allowance is available for loss and industry adoption of the unfunded versus funded reserves is mixed any applestoapples comparison should include the combined reserve we expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly upwards as we expect loan growth to continue as well as continued economic uncertainty due to current market conditions both of these conditions support credit provisions going forward ill turn the call now over to scott scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the first quarter down million or linked quarter trading and syndication fees were the primary drivers of the linked quarter decline down million and million respectively these are partially offset by a million linkedquarter increase in mortgage banking fees the trading fee decline was primarily driven by a million reduction in our mbs trading activities as mortgage originations remain at historically low levels as our trading volumes for both originations and sales market volatility in response to recent bank failures has also restrained trading activity commercial loan syndication fees decreased million linked quarter largely due to significant activity in energy and cre during the fourth quarter fees from our municipal investment banking segment increased million linked quarter the million increase in mortgage banking fees is driven by increased servicing revenue and improved mortgage origination pipeline volumes coming off the seasonally low fourth quarter fiduciary and asset management fees were million for the first quarter a linkedquarter increase our assets under management or administration were billion an increase of billion or linked quarter with growth across all categories our asset mix of assets under management or administration was relatively unchanged this quarter with fixed income equities cash and alternatives we believe our diversified mix of fee income is the strategic differentiator for us when compared to our peers especially during times of economic uncertainty we consistently rank in the top decile for fee income as a percent of total net interest revenue and noninterest fee income that revenue mix has averaged just over during the last months that consistently supports a revenue stream that is sustainable through most economic cycles ill now turn over the call to marty to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter marty martin e grunst executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp thanks scott turning to slide first quarter net interest revenue was million consistent with the prior quarter despite two fewer days in the quarter as expected the net interest margin decreased basis points linked quarter to due to modestly higher deposit betas and lower demand deposit levels due to the rate environment the average effective rate on an interestbearing deposit increased basis points this quarter bringing our cumulative deposit beta to since the fed began tightening average earning assets increased billion compared to the last quarter the average available for sale portfolio increased million this quarter reflecting the full quarter impact of purchases made during q4 average loans increased million with growth in both commercial and commercial real estate loans turning to slide we highlight our relatively neutral interest rate risk position assuming a gradual increase of basis points over months net interest revenue would decrease only or approximately million assuming a gradual decrease of basis points over months net interest revenue would decrease by approximately we expect to maintain a position which is neither materially asset or liability sensitive for the near term turning to slide linked quarter total expenses decreased million million from personnel and million from other operating expense the personnel expense decline was driven by a million reduction in bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 cash based compensation partially offset by million seasonal increase in employee benefits primarily payroll taxes and a million increase in staffing costs due to annual merit increases the linked quarter decrease in other operating expense was primarily driven by reduced professional fees and accruals for mortgage loss mitigation costs as well as a contribution to the bokf charitable foundation made in the fourth quarter turning to slide ill cover our expectations for we continue to expect mid to upper single digit annualized loan growth economic conditions in our geographic footprint remain very strong and continue to be supported by business inmigration from other markets strong growth in unfunded commitments during and current low levels of line utilization should be an additional tailwind for loan growth evolving borrower sentiment given the macro economy could impact our assumption if they pull back expecting a slower economic environment we expect to continue holding our available for sale securities portfolio flat in and to maintain a neutral interest rate risk position we have a strong base of core deposits and expect attrition in total deposits to taper off moving our loan to deposit ratio slightly higher while still remaining below historical levels currently we are assuming one additional 25basispoint increase in may before the federal reserve deposits we believe the margin will migrate lower throughout as interestbearing deposit betas increase and demand deposit balance attrition runs its course net interest income is expected to be in the range of billion to billion for in aggregate we expect total fees and commissions revenue to approach million for we expect expenses to be near or slightly below q4 levels and the efficiency ratio near or throughout the remainder of our allowance level is slightly above the median of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve given our expectations for loan growth and the strength of our credit quality we expect quarterly provision expense similar to that in q1 of changes in the economic outlook will impact our provision expense and we expect to continue our quarterly share repurchases ill now turn the call back over to stacy for closing commentary stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks marty as we have demonstrated this quarter strong risk management and strong financial results are not mutually exclusive we expect to do both well our talented teams collaborate well to ensure we grow our company the right way a way that is sustainable through all economic cycles while the market is more focused on capital and liquidity strong metrics spread dont lose sight of the strong earnings performance in the first quarter for the last two quarters i have concluded my prepared remarks by saying that we are in this stage where investing in strong banks versus trading the sector is expected to matter banks with thoughtful growth a diverse business mix meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform that certainly played out in the first quarter we are an organic growth company with a fantastic geographic footprint and believe we are wellpositioned to outperform both in the current environment and in the years to come with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 question and answer section operator thank you we will now be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc please proceed with your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc you may have touched on some of this and answered it but just can you talk about deposit flows kind of pre midmarch and post midmarch if they changed at all for you guys martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah jon this is marty yeah we really did not see much of a change at all if you look prepost i mean its hard to really discern difference in the trend there we were able to get talking points out to our customer base really the same day and further information the following day and the message was compelling and so you saw certainly a little bit of in and a little bit of out but it was really no discernible impact for us jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay fair enough and you use the term deposit attrition running its course marty and help us understand that where do these balances eventually go and how long does it take to run its course martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yes i think youll see the demand deposit attrition kind of run its course and so demand deposit really thats a shift between the demand and the interestbearing and so youll see that kind of run its course over the next couple of quarters i think but in terms of total deposits our expectation is that that levels off here in q2 and we kind of land at a loantodeposit ratio in the low jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then one for you marc whats the message on the commitment numbers youre giving us and what are you seeing in your loan pipeline in terms of what is growing and whats maybe contracting or slowing marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 well were actively out meeting with customers meeting with prospects we are trying to generate additional loan business were open we have good strong credit quality in place and our credit culture is one that we tend to we tend to be consistent we try not to loosen standards or tighten the standards but to evaluate each deal on an ongoing basis and the economies in our markets have been pretty strong and so what we are seeing is were still seeing some growth in pipeline we see opportunities that are existing and were comfortable with that that is consistent with the type of guidance were getting around loan growth we have slowed our additions of commercial real estate commitments because we are close to our upper limit from in terms of capital but we expect outstandings to grow as our construction loans fund up the rest of our verticals and lines of business general ci are still progressing forward energy continues to be pretty strong and the outlook is good in that market and like i said our ci were going to be selective but were also going to continue to identify opportunities stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp this is stacy jon i think one of the points that jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp were making with our teams is that these are the types of environments where we can be most differentiated because our strong capital and liquidity level we dont have to be inwardly focused and kind of concentrate on things that are more optically driven that allows us to continue to be externally focused and continue to focus on customer acquisition and new business development and i think the ability to be externally focused at a time like this i think is to our long term best interest and i think part of our history has been this is when we generally can differentiate our self the most in the marketplace jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thanks guys i appreciate the help operator our next question comes from the line of brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you good morning guys martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp good morning brady bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so the share buyback has been relatively consistent over time but you repurchase stock at about a share in the first quarter the stocks now at so about onefourth of tangible book value so the valuation of your stock is more compelling do you think about increasing the size of the buyback just given where the stock is trading going forward martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah brady we see that the same way and so we are enthusiastic about our share buyback opportunity here in the second quarter stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp disappointed to get the opportunity but we see it the same way you do brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah yeah i mean then maybe just quickly i mean two of your lending segments that are pretty notable your healthcare is loans energy is of loans so those two combined are about a third of your loan portfolio maybe just a quick update on what youre seeing credit quality wise in both of those segments marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp well ill take this is marc ill take energy first i mean energy credit quality is about as good as it could possibly be with oil prices even with gas prices where they are we have strong borrowing base supported customers the other thing that we have is very strong hedging activity in our energy portfolio so most of our gas weighted customers are hedged through at versus the spot rate and if you look you can hedge out gas today almost out into so the ability to look forward for a gas producer is in good shape and oil continues to be a very flat curve its down a little bit but its the overall its in good shape so we expect to continue no credit issues in that portfolio for the foreseeable future the healthcare side continues to be a good portfolio for us the only material issues in that industry seem to be around medicare medicaid reimbursements which are just taking time to catch up but were seeing some of the issues around staffing ease a little bit and we see growth in that an opportunity in the senior housing segment which is the primary part of our healthcare portfolio and no material issues systemic on any credit quality issues stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp brady this is stacy i think on the healthcare side i think the market has made the mistake a little bit of looking at the performance of some of these healthcare reits and things like that and trying to look through to the banks bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 and see how that could impact the banks and i just think that that permanent financing market is so different than the bank finance market customer selection is so critical and the portfolio for us has performed so well over such a long period of time that we dont have any nearterm concerns at all and over the long term its probably been our single best performing asset quality segment that we have on our books today at least over the last years brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful and then finally for me either tlac becomes partially effective for the banks beginning next year the banks over billion i know you guys right now are a little under billion but as you possibly grow over billion you begin to become subject to tlac will that be any impact would you have to raise any debt or any liquidity sources to become tlac compliant martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah so this is marty id say that the jurys still out on exactly which portions of that systemic and systemically important bank set of regulations will flow down from the billion into the billion to the to the billion that the jurys still out on that and id even say the tlacs probably the less the least likely component of that to hit billion and i think aoci is actually more likely to affect the billion to billion crowd and for us because of the way were already managing our common equity that aoci impact would be pretty negligible for us so were not looking at that regulatory waterfall as something that would be really problematic for us at this point but well learn more about that over the next well a little bit more in may and then a lot more over the next year how thats really going to play out brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right thats helpful thank you guys operator our next question comes from the line of brett rabatin with hovde group please proceed with your question q hey guys this is ph brian calling in for brett how are you guys stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good q all right just want to go quickly back to deposits you guys are close to cumulative beta just want to get your thoughts around the cadence on funding costs and where you could see the terminal beta through the cycle or pc going much higher from here bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah were right at and we do think that that comes higher through the rest of the year were actually reflecting a number thats basically around for the at the end of the year in our assumption set so weve already got that baked in and that covers both the next rate hike in may and then some amount of trickle up after that just would naturally occur in the portfolio q all right great thank you thats it for me thanks stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yes thank you martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp thanks ph brian operator our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo please proceed with your question timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning this is timur braziler filling in for jared just again circling back on deposits appreciate the commentary about the expected continued attrition albeit at a slower pace looking specifically at demand deposits were starting to approach the prepandemic level im just wondering just the magnitude of rate hikes can we see that actually going below that prepandemic level or is there good visibility that thats a good floor for demand deposits here martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp i actually do think that itll come a little bit below that because youve got just a higher ultimate rate level than we saw prepandemic and so just because of that i think our central case here in our internally were thinking that that does go somewhat below the but it remains in the low thats our base case expectation there stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and all of these assumptions that weve talked about are really reflected in the net interest revenue guidance that weve provided this quarter as well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and for the deposit outflows that we have been seeing how much of that is going to that money market account and the mutual funds and the ability to bring those back online would there be any reason to kind of bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 proactively bring those back online or are you comfortable that much of those funds will kind of matriculate back to the balance sheet once the rate environment starts turning in the other direction martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yes so ill start and scott may add to this but we have seen a decent percentage of that attrition off the balance sheet go on balance sheet in our own brokerdealer within the various marketbased alternatives that we offer there and so thats really just been a function of price and so thats something that can be relatively easily stopped or reversed as we make sure that our price point and our attention to that particular side of the business is focused on retaining that and bringing it back on balance sheet scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah so this is scott the thing i would add on that just specific to the balances that have migrated to various areas inside of our wealth management organization its really comprised of not just institutional money market funds but weve seen significantly high levels of activity in treasuries specifically short term tbills and were starting to see the maturity of that big move of liquid dollars that went on in late in the fourth quarter of last year and throughout the first quarter of this year so we have a significant multibillion a few billion dollars of treasury volumes that have migrated from our balance sheet and then also and those are handled by us in within the broker dealer and then significant balances totaling billion in institutional and other types varieties of money market funds so to the point that marty made when we have hit a price point and can price those at a level that we want and need those balances we feel confident that we can bring values and amounts back that were interested in putting back on the balance sheet martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp but to your point earlier the vast preponderance of the liquidity thats left the balance sheet has flowed through our wealth and broker dealer platform that we manage and that we help our customers manage and so thats what makes that easier in the event that at the right price point we can bring it back timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thats good color and then just one last one for me looking at the unfunded commitments i guess how much of that is formulaic and what starts to fund up this year are you starting to see some of these construction deals push back just given some of the broader macro uncertainty and i guess on the other side of that what is your appetite right now to be legging in to the funding of some of these construction deals in this environment stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp this is stacy i mean weve made a commitment where were going to fund on the commitments that we make regardless of what the environment is our outstanding growth really if you look over the last several years has really been focused in multifamily and industrial those are two segments that are still performing very well and are anticipated to continue to perform well weve underweighted retail and office you see that in the lack of growth in those segments and in fact those areas have declined over the last several periods as well bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 so i dont clearly theres concern about that at the end of the day weve got of our total loans in commercial real estate so the fact that we have institutionally really underweighted that segment relative to other regional banks we think will help us in addition to the fact that we think weve done a good job with our underwriting and customer selection as well but i think ultimately having diversity in our lending portfolio will prove to be very valuable to us over time timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and are you seeing any clients kind of push back that funding schedule or is it pretty much in alignment with original plans stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp were not seeing any changes in borrower behavior at this point timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you for that operator our next question comes from the line of thomas wendler with stephens please proceed with your question thomas wendler q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp good morning tom stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning thomas wendler q analyst stephens inc i just want to go back to the brokerage and trading fees turned mostly by trading fees last quarter can you just idea of the moving parts there moving forward where you expect to see some growth and maybe some problems as we move forward scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah so this is scott so when we when you look at the trend second half of last year as you know we were in the midst of consistent rate increases theres no question that we saw uncertainty and some volatility some bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 widening of spreads in the fixed income markets and so our desks have done a good job of managing our risk positions and still staying active in the space and serving our customers with liquidity and we feel like as we built into the first quarter of this year we had begun kind of back on a more consistent and sustainable growth trend in our balances and our activities in the mortgage back space the second half of march obviously saw some disruption and dislocation to the market but weve seen steady results out of that activity weve seen an increase in flows and revenues associated with municipal bond activity which have actually now supplanted our mortgage backed securities revenues in some aspects of that revenue generation so we feel like were going to see as mortgage rates become acclimated the mortgage borrowers acclimate the current rate environment were not facing a steady stream of rate increases well see those flows migrate up and that activity and volume levels will normalize so were optimistic about the activity in that space stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and just a reminder and this is stacy that segment is very volatile but if you look at total fees and commissions and weve got those broken out on slide of the presentation over a period of time its a very stable source of earnings so any individual category can move around a bit from quartertoquarter but the total category is very stable and in fact we havent changed our guidance for this section for the full year scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp because as stacy mentioned that if you look at the actual total revenues for our brokerdealer aggregated were up slightly in the first quarter versus the fourth quarter but the and that takes into account the fact were earning higher revenue streams on money market funds and other sources as balances have migrated thomas wendler q analyst stephens inc all right i appreciate all the color guys thanks for answering my questions operator operator instructions our next question comes from the line of peter winter with da davidson please proceed with your question peter j winter q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp good morning peter peter j winter q analyst da davidson co bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 i just wanted to ask it was a very good presentation just with this strong balance sheet and credit trends are you seeing opportunities to take market share in your markets and secondly are you seeing some of the competitors pull back with whats going on stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah i think in the first i think its probably a little bit too early to say definitively that were seeing opportunities to take market share but certainly anecdotally were hearing opportunities within the market both in terms of talent and customer opportunities we can grow both ways adding talented team members to our core here as well as adding customers and prospects as well and so i think we see both of those its a little early to be definitive about that but clearly thats the case anecdotally as we look forward and kind of see the environment it really will depend on how long the markets perception of the weakness in the sector continues i think as long as it persist i think our strength will continue to allow us to create some disproportionate opportunities that were working very hard to take advantage of even as we speak peter j winter q analyst da davidson co got it and then martin i had a question about the net interest income outlook the assumption is that the fed pauses on rates but if we look at the forward curve it does assume two or three rate cuts and if we get that is there pressure on the net interest income range to come in below the low end of that range if we get the rate cuts martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah peter were relatively balanced on our rate risk position and so the guidance ranges we gave even if we saw that i think wed still expect to be within that range stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah we dont our internal forecast doesnt assume the rate cuts but we have on slide define for the market what would happen in a down ramp so you can see the impact that we forecast the net interest revenue should that scenario play out over time its not significant on a quarterly or annual basis at all recall that that we moved back in the fourth quarter to position ourselves to be more rate neutral youve followed us for a long time and know that we traditionally have been rate neutral in terms of how we manage interest rate risk we did lean in asset sensitive to benefit from rising rates but in the fall our views began to shift that the risk were more balanced between up and down and so took action early to mitigate any interest rate risk and so were really positioned to be much more neutral today and really back to the position weve been historically over most of my career here peter j winter q analyst da davidson co all right thanks stacy nice quarter in a tough environment stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 thank you martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp thanks operator our next question comes from line of brandon king with truist securities please proceed with your question brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so could you help us quantify the level of deposit attrition youre expecting this year and kind of give us a sense of the trajectory of the tapering and kind of when you expect deposit balances to stabilize martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yeah brandon our outlook there is that youll see tapering of the total deposit balances here in q2 and then we kind of end up with a low loan to deposit ratio and sure theres hard to put a pin in exactly the decimal point there but i think that gives you a pretty good outlook for how we see the rest of the year playing out brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it so stabilization back half of the year correct martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp correct yes thats right brandon king q analyst truist securities inc oh okay martin e grunst a executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp yes bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 26apr2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and a followup on your comments on brokers and trading is it fair to assume that the inventory of trading securities should kind of rise incrementally throughout the year just given those trends stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp i think that a lot of that depends on mortgage originations it depends on flows as a whole and then downstream customer appetite for mortgagebacked securities but we would expect that as we normalize in the rate outlook and the fed clarity sets in we would expect to grow those balances and those levels back to more historic levels brandon king q analyst truist securities inc got it got it well theres my questions thank you very much operator thank you we have no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments martin e grunst executive vice president chief risk officer bok financial corp well thanks again everyone for joining us and if you have any further
