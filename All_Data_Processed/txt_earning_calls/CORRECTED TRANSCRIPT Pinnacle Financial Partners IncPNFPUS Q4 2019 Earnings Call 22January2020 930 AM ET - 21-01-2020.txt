will be available on pinnacle financials website at wwwpnfpcom with that i am now going to turn the presentation over to mr terry turner pinnacles president and ceo m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thanks cherie good morning as we always do ill begin with this dashboard as a reminder its typically focused on revenue growth earnings growth and asset quality because we continue to believe that theyre the three most highly correlated metrics to longterm shareholder returns q4 was a good quarter for our firm we continued to have a strong balance sheet growth already great asset quality got even better and despite a little contraction in revenue and fully diluted eps sequentially we still had yearoveryear growth in revenue and growth yearoveryear growth in eps with all the noise and adjustments primarily in previous period is in many cases the nongaap measures might better illustrate the relative performance of the firm as a reminder the reason we begin each quarterly earnings call with data that goes back to five years is because as you can see irrespective of the ma impacts deposit betas outsized cre payoffs or any of the other hot buttons that have come and gone our balance sheet growth and until this quarter our growth in revenue and eps has been remarkably rapid and reliable and in we continued our sharetaking balance sheet growth however as i mentioned on the last slide despite being up yearoveryear both revenue and fully diluted eps declined on a sequential quarter basis my hope is that thats not a surprise to anyone i believe weve adequately signaled to the market last quarter that it would be the case largely as a result of two key reasons number one bhg is in the process of converting a greater volume of their originations to hold on their balance sheet as opposed to selling them through their auction platform for immediate gain from feet we agree that increase in spread business should result in a more viable franchise so were supportive of that im also happy to report that regardless of the increase in production for their balance sheet and the associated reduction in gain on sale revenues that find its way to our pl in the fourth quarter originations for bhg were at an alltime high and thats where the value is created in that firm so we continue to expect that line item to be up to or so for over harold will cover this in greater detail in just a minute of course the second major impact came from contraction in net interest margin despite the contraction in nim we made great headway on cost of funds in and expect further headway in first quarter of believing we may find a floor for our margin sooner than we had anticipated harold will also comment further on this momentarily as it relates to asset quality virtually every quarter we report that theres only one direction for asset quality to move but believe it or not we saw still further improvement in our already strong asset quality metrics in with meaningful reductions in nonperforming assets and net chargeoffs during the quarter i know by now everybody is familiar with the business case that we made for the bnc acquisition as you recall the plan was to continue the high growth cre platform that bnc had built and bolton to that a ci platform which is the principal strength of our firm the critical path to make that happen was to deliver our ongoing pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 recruitment competence in order to attract and retain the best ci and private bankers in the market specifically we had said wed higher of them over a fiveyear period of time as you can see rick callicutt and his team surpassed the hiring target at this point in the plan by more than two fold the environment for hiring great bankers in the carolinas and virginia has only gotten better since we launched our transaction there one of the reasons that i chose to continue to highlight this in fourth quarter is it demonstrates just how vulnerable those banks are that dominate the carolinas and virginia and atlanta and consequently that bears on our belief about the magnitude of the opportunity that we see in atlanta later i will discuss our target markets the rationale for them and more specifically our focus on atlanta but i want to at least highlight the magnitude of the opportunity that we see in our existing footprint by virtue of our overlap with truist of our existing offices are within miles of a truist location so we believe were extremely well position to capitalize on any vulnerability encountered as a result of that merger so our outlook remains extremely optimistic thats it from feet let me turn it over to harold to review the quarter in greater detail harold r carpenter chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks terry good morning everybody weve updated this revenue per share slide of fourth quarter results as you can see we continue to experience yearoveryear of doubledigit revenue per share growth the red dotted line represents the peer groups yearoveryear growth we outpace our peers on revenue per share consistently by a wide margin our relationship managers have remained focused on gathering clients and generating incremental revenues for our firm obviously bhgs performance has had a meaningful influence on these results as we have mentioned before we dont apologize for that at all we continue to expect to revenue growth from bhg in even though bhg was down in the fourth quarter bhg will be back in the coming quarters as you know bhg had afforded us opportunities to invest in our franchise as well as provide significant tangible book value accretion were also excited about de novo expansion into atlanta and what that will do to our revenue per share growth over the next few years now comparing the fourth quarter loans to the fourth quarter of our growth was nearly at this time we have no reason to believe that our loan growth outlook for will be any less than the high singledigit to low doubledigit growth as you know we booked about billion in loan growth in we have no reason to believe we wont exceed that in we make that statement because of the success of our hiring over the last few years the continued success we anticipate in hiring in our present markets and the energy that comes through our franchise from atlanta next is an update to our loan pricing our loan mix averages approximately to libor and prime which substantially all of the libor credit being tied to 30day libor and about fixed rate with cre being the primary contributor in the weighted average coupons for libor and primebased credits for loan book decreased by basis points for libor and basis points for prime which is somewhat of a victory given we experienced basis points of rate cuts so the spreads in this category actually have widened in inclusive of a rate cut of significance to the spread on fixed rate credit as a proxy for fixed rate spread performance and to keep it simple weve traditionally used the fiveyear treasury as the benchmark the fiveyear treasury decreased basis points during the year while our average fixed rate loan book actually increased basis points pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 now deposits average deposit balances were up billion yearoveryear our average deposit costs were down basis points in the fourth quarter of from the third quarter and stood at for the quarter our charges continue to reduce deposit rates while at the same time increasing our deposit volumes to fund loan growth and reduce our dependency on the more expensive wholesale funding to that point and as we mentioned in the press release last night were modifying our annual incentive plan to include a deposit component and growing the lowcost core deposits similar to prior years the annual cash plan will still be based on corporate eps targets which yield top quartile earnings per share growth rate within our peer group we felt like we needed to incorporate into the plan a deposit volume and cost component to energize our entire workforce around accumulating more lowcost core deposits were optimistic about this change and how our associates will respond to accomplish this new incentive target more on deposit rates our relationship managers we believe did a bang up job of managing our deposit costs in this rate environment in the negotiated rate bucket weve achieved a 32basis point decline since june of our relationship managers were very much in tune with the rate environment and prepared to have more discussions with our client base about rate decreases at a minimum we should experience decreases in cd rates for the next couple of quarters as repricing occurs for what its worth our modeling is still suggesting a rate decrease in july and another in november our goal is a beta for our interestbearing deposit book so weve got a ways to go to achieve our targets but we are off to a great start it will take us a few more quarters on cds our cd book is split about customer and wholesale the wholesale cds will roll out fairly quickly giving us an average duration of slightly more than six months while the customer book will take a little longer as its duration is less than months as the chart on the right details through the month of december and excluding cds weve experienced basis points of rate declines with basis points and the funds decreases are a beta of if you include cds our beta is but again the cd beta should increase over the next couple of quarters as cds reprice all things considered we believe overall deposit rates should be down in the first quarter we do expect downward momentum at rates to be offset by our usual mix change in the first quarter as non interest bearing deposit growth is pressured by clients reducing their balances for taxes and other payments that normally occur in the first quarter of each year as we enter were anticipating that our first quarter margin may be flat to down slightly we believe were getting very close to an inflection point related to margin compression the speculation of the credit cycle change should a recession occur has been on investors mind for quite some time right now as far as credit risk is concerned based on our credit metrics and what harvey and his team tell us times remain pretty darn good weve shown these charts four of the charts provide us even more comfort that were not booking the very large cre credits credit remains at the forefront of our mind so i hope we never appear complacent when we talk about credit for the fourth quarter we experienced probably our best credit quarter in quite some time with most of our credit related ratios seeing better results in the fourth quarter and may be the best mark weve posted in several years so we agree with other bankers that were not seeing any systemic issues that will cause us to change our perspectives about credit going into concerning cecl ive read a few fourth quarter conference call transcripts on cecl impacts in day one and day two and all that cecl is important and weve burned a lot of time and quite frankly eps over the last two years pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 getting ready for the january adoption day to be honest id rather be talking about market share gains and growth and share the excitement we have for this franchise that said were in the final stages of validating the various models we will use to determine the allowance account each quarter preliminarily we believe the allowance account should be less than basis points as of january so as we think about provision expense for obviously many factors go into projecting provision including economic forecast as well as our loan mix in excluding chargeoffs if you were to divide up our provision expense by average net loan growth that provisioning expense was approximately basis points for the year were anticipating that we would be providing our net new loan growth in at a rate that falls between the rate of basis points in the day implementation rate which as i mentioned is projected to be less than basis points again many assumptions tons but if that works out simplistically the impacts cecl will have to our pl should serve to reduce our eps by to in when we comparing the cecl methodology through the inherent loss model now lets get back to talking about revenues these totaled more than million in up more than over bhgs contribution was up nearly million or nearly yearoveryear more on bhg in a second our other fee businesses had a strong with residential mortgage leading the way up approximately yearoveryear mortgage had a great correlating not only with drops in longterm rates but also with increases in the number of mortgage originators again great markets are very helpful with this line of business so we anticipate mortgage to continue with strong growth in we have no reason to believe we want wont to see lowdouble digit fee growth in concerning bhg its safe to say that bhg had a phenomenal year and we feel really good about their prospects going into originations were at alltime highs and i expect stronger performance going into next year as anticipated bhg began to purposefully keep more of their loans on their balance sheet thus realizing more interest income rather than relying as heavily on gain on sale as their primary revenue source theyve secured two separate funding sources which will allow them to warehouse their loans thus far about million in loans are in these two vehicles as a result and as anticipated bhgs revenues were down from third quarter due to more of their loans being held on balance sheet a quick review on originations increased million during of which million resulted in increases on balance sheet loan balances you can see on the chart ranges for growth for and all of these various areas that bhg is currently contemplating so theres no slowing down bhg is at peak performance and intends to stay there lastly concerning the chart at the bottom right the network of banks buying their credit remains very active they continue to increase the number of banks in their network and you can see with little changes to yields and spreads specifically as to earnings earnings growth of bhg was tremendous in and it has a lot to do with better analytics better marketing better scorecards branching into new verticals and hiring more sales professionals all of this hit a new stride in the second quarter of bhg believes a fair earnings growth rate for is to as to quarterly growth of bankers healthcare group we expect first quarter to be very much as at the high end of their growth rate when compared to last years first quarter we then expect quarterly results to more or less flatten out for the rest of the year as bhg works the balance sheet strategy and their traditional gain on sale model at the same time pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 the chart on the right is at the core of many questions we get about bankers healthcare group with the shift to more of a balance sheet model you can see that they will not abandon gain on sale but believe they can reduce the impact and thus diversify bhgs revenue strength which is at the heart of the strategy diversification of the revenue stream as well as diversification of their funding sources they are targeting a longer term target of interest income as a percentage of total revenues of more than to but suffice it to say to get the over the next two year to three years would be a tremendous accomplishment so now briefly on expenses as we know here salarys up largely due to increased personnel and increased award levels in the incentive plan in versus equipment and occupancy are up yearoveryear due to increased technology cost and the branch rationalization project that we began and completed in as for our run rate moving forward using the fourth quarter as a base were anticipating expenses to increase in the mid singledigit range in weve got a big hiring plan this year inclusive of atlanta which terry will go into more detail in a few minutes for the last few years our expense average assets including merger has been in the range we dont see that changing much at all in and as i discussed last quarters call weve modified our longer term operating ranges our previous metrics were in place since we believe the granularity provided by those previous measurements served its purpose so were now opting to go with a higher level of guidance with operating ranges for our roaa rotc and tangible equity as our current guidepost for roaa were targeting to for the fourth quarter were operating slightly outside of that range at but i anticipate getting back in within the range fairly quickly with bhgs strategy change becoming less impactful to linked quarter results and as atlanta builds out rotce should also respond in a similar fashion and were also operating in the high end of the range on tangible equity ratio just to remind everyone weve operated outside our published ranges in previous years albeit they were the previous targets i think it took us two plus years to get to our nonextra expense target in our early days same is true today although were thinking it will take only a few quarters the communication objective here is that we will find our own way back to these ranges quickly with that ill turn it back over to terry to talk about our outlook for the atlanta market m terry turner president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc okay thanks harold as most of you know weve generally targeted the largest fastestgrowing urban markets in the southeast for some time weve used this map to illustrate our desired geographies there are urban markets that were originally targeted in this triangle from memphis to dc and from memphis to charleston south carolina today were operating in of the and its our expectation that we can generally produce doubledigit loan growth with no further market extension in other words we expect double digit growth from the blue markets in which we currently operate thats a pretty enviable position to build a current market presence that should yield doubledigit growth in general weve been operating right through the core of this triangle but not at the fringes so the remaining targets include atlanta and georgia and columbia south carolina to the south and the hampton roads area of virginia richmond virginia and washington dc to the north in my judgment easily the most attractive of those remaining targeted markets is atlanta obviously weve chosen these southeastern markets because of their size and growth dynamics they support our aspirations to pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 build a large highgrowth base and weve chosen them because theyre familiar to us we understand how business is done in them frankly i love our model but im not completely sure if it would be as effective in say new england as an example beyond our familiarity with them weve chosen these markets because of our confidence in our ability to attract the best bankers and provide distinctive service to their clients and that yields huge market share takeaway specifically from those large vulnerable competitors that currently dominate all these markets so in short from a strategic standpoint we target large highgrowth urban markets that are dominated by wells fargo suntrust bank of america and regions thats why i say in my judgment atlanta is easily the most attractive market in which we can expand its the largest fast growing market and its dominated by truist bank of america and wells fargo all of them seem incredibly vulnerable at this time honestly i view this as a once in a generation opportunity to grow a big bank in one of the nations most attractive markets perhaps even more exciting than the opportunity we saw and have seized in nashville i dont really want to spend a lot of time selling the atlanta market i expect mostly everyone is familiar with its size and growth dynamics but quickly its the ninth largest msa in the country by population its the number one moving destination in the nation for the ninth consecutive year its median household income is consistently more than higher than the southeast and as a median more than higher and its an extremely rich market for businesses which is the thrust of our firm there are fortune companies headquartered there fortune companies and of the nations fast growing private companies specifically there are nearly businesses with sales from million to million which is our target market and where we excel not only are the size and growth dynamics of the atlanta market overwhelmingly attractive frankly the more compelling attribute is the competitive landscape its a market in a dramatic state of turmoil and diminished brand loyalty across the board of the top banks in are no longer in the market of todays top are there by way of acquisition and many still exhibit the vulnerability typically associated with merger and integration not only that but im in possession of the greenwich research on client satisfaction with banks in the atlanta market it would suggest that even prior to the announcement of the suntrustbbt merger the client satisfaction of those big banks that dominate the atlanta market is even worse there than it is form in nashville where weve been so successful taking their share so the opportunity is ripe so instead of wasting a lot of time building the case for the obvious the attractiveness of the atlanta market i really prefer to spend more time on our vision for atlanta what we intend to build and how we intend to do it the best illustration to that is what weve already actually done in nashville another relatively large highgrowth absolutely dominated by bank of america suntrust and regions or its predecessor amsouth back in when we started pinnacle loan on a de novo basis many of you will recall that the catalyst for our forming in pinnacle was the sale of first american corporation a billion bank holding company headquartered in nashville and the last large locally owned bank to be rolled up by outofstate headquartered banks in that case amsouth it seems to me that the parallel to atlanta is obvious bank of america suntrust and regions each had to deposit market share in nashville when we started i personally never forget don kennedy of kennedy roofing company coming in and opening our first checking account our first line of credit that was it on october one client in other words we had nothing when we set our sights on those three dominant banks so this chart paints a pretty vivid picture of what weve been able to do since that time and how weve done it pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 in terms of what weve done at june we continued to top fdic deposit share chart where weve been for a few years now and my goal is not to gloat about our success and disparage our competitors but i need to make sure im clear about the magnitude of the market share takeaway because it bears on the success were targeting in atlanta due to competitive vulnerabilities we just discussed as you can see on the fdic chart today regions has roughly of deposit market in nashville regions today represents a combination of what was once regions union planters and amsouth which on a combined basis had north of market share in nashville when we started in so thats an market share giveup by regions and its predecessors since we started and im not going to go through and highlight each competitor but suffice it to say virtually all of the big banks that dominated the market when pinnacle started from scratch at nashville have given up market share from which we have successfully grown more importantly look at the greenwich associates data on the top right of the slide first of all this is data regarding businesses with annual sales from million to million whats plotted here is lead bank share for the five banks with the largest business share in nashville and the level of satisfaction that their clients express about let me start with the lead share position as you can see today were in the first position at the top of the chart and not by a little by a lot roughly of the businesses in nashville view pinnacle as their lead bank our next closest competitor has just share thats a pretty commanding lead for having started at zero and then focusing on what our clients think about the differentiated level of service we provide them roughly give us the top box rating while some of our competitors receive a percentage of top box score from their clients down in the range which is a phenomenon that suggests to me regardless of our already dominant position there is still a meaningful ongoing market share takeaway opportunity in nashville which ill develop further in just a minute now at the bottom left of the slide we focus on how we take so much share from these large vulnerable competitors according to greenwich the attributes down the left side of the chart are the things that are most valued by our business clients as you can see from the key the darker green the box the more dominant you are versus competitors on those items that matter most to businesses and the brighter red the box the more vulnerable you are to competitors on those same items as you can see we dominate the nashville business market in terms of how easy we are to do business with how effectively were able to demonstrate that we value longterm relationships the net promoter score which is generally the measure of a clients desire and willingness to recommend us to their peers and our overall digital experience i dont want to get too far from my central message here but there is one i cant resist highlighting and thats our clients view of our digital channel offering as a business focused bank i love our number one position in the nashville market as it relates to our business clients overall regard for our digital channel offering versus how the business clients of truist bank of america and wells fargo regarding their digital channel offering all right thats enough of that setting aside that as you continue on down the chart you can see the power of our unique hiring model as our relationship managers dominate and then finally our treasury management systems also dominate the nashville market against these larger regional and national franchises looking at the lower right of that chart i wont walk you through each aspect of our execution in the market but you can see that businesses who arent currently our clients hold us in extremely high regard which speaks to the pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 ongoing share takeaway potential i mentioned a minute ago and our existing clients favor us with more business than the clients of our competitors favor them with their business as i mentioned a couple of times now it appears to me that despite our dominant position we still have meaningful market share take away opportunity in nashville our ability to seize the vulnerabilities of these large banks is still picking up speed as you can see our lead bank share in nashville grew last year lead bank share just last year this model of hiring the best bankers in the market away from those large vulnerable competitors and then getting them to move their book of business by enabling them to focus on what clients value most continues to be a winning play against the banks that used to dominate nashville and currently dominate atlanta so this is our aspiration in atlanta in the next five years we expect to aggressively recruit and hire the best bankers in the market from the large vulnerable regional and national competitors more specifically not dissimilar to the hiring approach we took to building our ci focus in the carolinas and virginia we expect to hire at least relationship managers a year or over a fiveyear period of time we intend to arm them with the same treasury management wealth management and differentiated back office service levels that have been so effective against those banks that dominate the atlanta market specifically that would entail hiring roughly to additional revenue producers over the fiveyear period as treasury management consultants wealth managers brokers mortgage originators sba loan originators and the like wed expect in general to open an office a year in the business rich trade areas of atlanta places like east cobb county buckhead north fulton county just to name a few we think we can build out a billion bank in the atlanta market over the fiveyear period we expect to invest to in eps during and cross breakeven in the third quarter of about an 18month breakeven period after a lot of dialogue with a number of candidates we selected rob garcia to build out our bank there over the years as i have discussed the atlanta opportunity ive always indicated that our goal wasnt just to build an lpo or to just hire a small sales team but hire management that was capable of operating across all banking disciplines and its capable of building a billion to billion bank rob has demonstrated an ability to do that hes a longstanding banker in the atlanta market he has been the atlanta market president for synovus where he was running a roughly billion bank prior to joining synovus by way of acquisition rob was instrumental in starting riverside bank a notable startup there that was sold to synovus in so rob is uniquely qualified from our perspective hes well known to pinnacles nashville based chief credit officer based on their previous working relationship in atlanta hes worked in a larger regional bank environment which gives him fluency in all the sophisticated products provided by pinnacle and those large regional and national franchises but he has a thorough understanding of the community banking model that pinnacle uses to differentiate itself from those larger banks since joining us in late december hes already hired three highly successful relationship managers one ci lender one private banker and one cre lender along with their key support personnel and the hiring pipelines appear to be filling up pretty rapidly so were off to a fast start and excited about the incremental growth opportunity that atlanta market provides us as i said earlier we view this as a once in a generation opportunity and we intend to make necessary investments to seize it so were extremely excited about our prospects in heres what were targeting continued doubledigit loan growth similar doubledigit growth in core deposits while we continue to beat our cost of funds down and low double digit growth fee growth longerterm we intend to capitalize on the economic and competitive landscape pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 in our target markets which is fabulous continue hiring revenue producers throughout the footprint and additionally in atlanta thats always been our revenue growth engine and honestly its never looked better and finally to continue to grow tangible book value because its my belief that companies that can compound tangible book value grow their share price meaningfully so cherie with that well stop and take questions question and answer section operator thank you mr turner the floor is now open for your questions operator instructions our first question comes from jennifer demba with suntrust jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc good morning m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi jen harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi jen jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc terry the atlanta expansion makes a ton of sense for you guys do you see a potential other de novo efforts for pinnacle in the next few years if opportunities should arise or do you think youll try and just focus in on atlanta and be yeah in focusing on atlanta m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thats a great question jen as you know im hesitant to make comments about were always going to do this and were never going do that or those kinds of things because opportunities change landscapes change all those kinds of things so i dont want to put myself in a position to say oh we just wouldnt do another de novo expansion but having said that and to put it into context to be honest with you sitting here right now my thrust is atlanta its an unbelievable opportunity its what we want to work on you know the market better than i do but it is so large and high growing and the competitive landscape is so right and what we do is so well suited to the opportunity that it just becomes sort of the top of my list of what i want to work on and so as a company thats where well dedicate a lot of resource and quite honestly thats where ill personally invest a meaningful amount of time jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 okay and can you talk about harold you mentioned something about the growth rate for bhg in the first quarter of and i dont think i understood it could you repeat that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah trying to build off the fourth quarter of but also comparing it to the first quarter of of we think the growth rate for the first quarter of this year will at least be over the first quarter of last year jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and any thoughts on a tax rate for harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we dont anticipate the tax rate to change very much in it ought to be the etr ought to be pretty similar jennifer demba q analyst suntrust robinson humphrey inc great thanks a lot good quarter m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc thank you harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hi steven steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start first on the margin harold i thought you said the nim would be flat to down in how do you think about the nim over the near term pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah that would be for the first quarter steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so that is the first quarter harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah we think itll be it wont be down much if it goes down so were hopefully were close to that inflection point here within the first half of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you and then stabilize beyond harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thats our current planning assumption steven weve still got a july rate cut in there whether or not that happens or not not sure but we did a lot of call it initiatives last year to kind of reduce our asset sensitivity and that has basically neutralized our balance sheet with respect to rate guys steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay and then on the atlanta expansion im curious how many relationship managers do you expect to add in and how did you come up with is the right overall number m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i guess the thrust is sort to how fast can you hire and assimilate people and so i think again in working with rob garcia who is our market leader there it felt a comfortable pace to us to hire relationship managers and i think you might think about it this way steven thered be maybe a number like ci bankers in the maybe a number like private bankers in the and maybe a number like cre banker in the and so that seemed like a comfortable build out pace for us and so its just simple math from there a year five years is thats not to say we wouldnt hire more if we have an opportunity which we may well have but thats sort of the core of what were trying to do as we build the ci platform i also indicated that well build out the other fee business professionals as well which would include treasury management consultants wealth managers primarily brokers mortgage originators and sba loan originators and so forth and so compared to the over five years thats probably another to revenue producers that would be added to that steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 okay thats helpful then just one final question so looking at the loan growth guidance for you included high single digit in the range are you just being conservative or do you see something that could cause loan growth to slow this year thanks harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think were being more about its more about being conservative than it is any kind of statement regarding what kind of energy we have within the franchise we did billion we ought to at least do that here going into steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color and thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thanks indiscernible operator thank you our next question comes from catherine mealor with kbw catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey catherine m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc good morning catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so harold in your earlier remarks you talked about how your incentive plan relies on eps growth versus as you compare it to peer eps growth and so as we think about what were seeing across maybe consensus across midcap banks either generally flat maybe even down eps growth for most of your peers so how do we think about what and i know youre not going to give us your goal but just conceptually is it fair to assume that there is some level of eps growth in over to get a full incentive compensation payout this year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think thats a fair assertion theres quantitative and qualitative factors going on youre right when you line up our peer group theres probably half of them that are now with estimates out there for negative earnings growth in over so you might say well its kind of like stepping over a rock or something to get to top pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 quartile but at the end of the day when you line it all up and you start thinking about okay how are you going to propel these shares whats going to make these shares move what kind of catalyst might be there and so we use that incentive plan that help create that energy and so you should assume that theres going to be outsized growth and i think if line up our peers you can probably see what kind of targets were shooting for catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thats good harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so i dont know if i got to your question but that would be my response catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no you do i think thats right i think i would assume that theres some level of eps growth for you to get a full payout but just wanted to kind of confirm that that makes sense and then maybe a followup to that just thinking about the expense build out i mean if we take your to eps investment for atlanta thats about call it million which is a very small piece of the overall expense growth this year if you kind of do it on a dollar basis so where is the rest of the expense growth coming from or is there some kind of revenue component also in that to investment harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc there definitely is a revenue component so terry has not been bashful with rob and assigning growth rates and all that sort of stuff so hes got himself a full time job ill say it like that so there is revenue growth in that number for atlanta the expense growth weve got a significant hiring plan coming up on us and that comes with an additional incentive cost in all that but that also gives us flexibility with some respects so the easiest thing we can get kind of quick returns off of with respect to our plan is to throttle back on expenses or otherwise use that incentive plan to help us perhaps offset revenue shortfalls and weve done that in the past so will be no different but what were speaking to today in our comments is a fairly significant hiring plan that weve got going into next year m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc and catherine i might just add to the harolds comments there jennifer demba asked a great question really about okay so would you take on other de novo opportunities in addition to atlanta and again thats not in our plan our plan is to focus on the markets that were in plus atlanta but i wouldnt want anybody to lose sight of were still building now a lot of revenue capability in markets like charlotte and raleigh and greenville and charleston and i think you probably saw in the fourth quarter i think we added revenue producers in the fourth quarter alone last quarter for fourth quarter of and so were still believing that this competitive landscape is right up our alley and were still finding great opportunity to hire banks largely from these large banks that we view to be so vulnerable so anyway ill just give you that color on the expense though catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 got it thats helpful great thank you so much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks catherine operator thank you our next question comes from stephen scouten with piper sandler stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hi stephen stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co im curious i think you said on cecl maybe it was a to kind of drag in your expectations so does that imply you think credit trends should kind of continue at their current pace and i guess provisioning would be in the million to million kind of range based on that math harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i dont think thats too far off we spent a lot of time with the credit industry traders trying to figure out what kind of chargeoff forecasts they might have for and were just not seeing anything that would alarm us that were going to see increased provisioning related to the chargeoffs for stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it okay and then kind of digging further into some of catherines questioning there just you guys noted a little bit below the roa target here in the fourth quarter but obviously not for the full year you did a great job on the full year relative to that target but it seems like itll be difficult really to deliver eps growth yearoveryear given nim headwinds midsingle digit expense growth and maybe a dip into the high single digits on a loan growth front how i guess confident are you around that ability to grow eps yearoveryear apart from maybe a reduction in incentive comp harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think its going to be a hard year obviously the yield curve is not helpful or has improved some over the last short term period here but the confidence we have is it goes back to the core its about what market youre operating in and what kind of objectives you layout on these people to say okay whats that old saying that without an objective any path will get you there or something you just got to kind of layout these goals i think there was a question earlier about how do we get to people pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 well a lot of that is just sitting down going eyeball to eyeball with people and saying hey you got to do this for us to get to the numbers we need to get to so we lay that out there and say okay you need to hire these many people thats the way weve operated this firm now for almost years and we think that at the end of the day our folks will deliver what weve tasked them to deliver its not that difficult actually as to how we operate this firm m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc stephen i might add to harolds comment just for whatever its worth you know this nobody knows the future including me and i dont know what all the market conditions are going to do and how they might change and whats the impact the political discourse in the country is going to be or what the impacts by north korea or iran or all those sorts of things but if youre talking about an environment that looks very much like the environment that were in today i cant imagine that its going to be is not going to produce earnings share growth earnings per share growth stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then just maybe last thing im curious you guys still have a pretty sizeable authorization on the share buybacks a little less active this quarter when youre modeling and youre thinking about the company for next year how are you thinking about capital planning and the share repurchases in particular m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah were still planning on using the rest of our allocation were likely to use it here over the next three quarters so well our four quarters we intend to use it stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay great thanks for the color guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right thank you stephen harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thank you stephen operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just looking at the bhg with the color on first quarter should we expect then that the rest of the year the growth is sort of a steady ramp from there or it will be a little lumpy pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah jared weve had a lot of conversation with bhg over the years about lumpiness i think the way its kind of planned out this year of what theyre shooting for is that youll see a ramp up from the fourth quarter into the first quarter and then a ramp up into the second quarter and then that growth rate will basically be flattish to slightly up for the rest of the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc so its been somewhat of a bell curve for a few years and so i think this year theyre planning on a kind of a ramp up in and and then kind of flattish into the last half of the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc and do those two funding facilities does that provide enough funding for them to meet their goals or is there an expectation that theyre going to get additional funding as we go through the year harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah the plan for them is to fund up here fairly quickly and then what theyll do is theyll securitize theyve got a million facility theyll securitize that facility and then in effect selling off to investors not the asset just the funding part theyll borrow money to set up a security and then theyll reload the warehouse jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it great and then on the margin with your expectation for a july cut there if we dont see a july cut is that incrementally positive to margin in the second half or are you running neutral enough now where it should be relatively neutral overall harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc oh i think will be positive i dont think itll be a big positive but i think itll be positive jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks very much harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc thanks jared pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 operator thank you our next question comes from brock vandervliet with ubs brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for the question just to follow up on those so if i understand this bhgs funding is now set between what theyve got organically in terms of the balance sheet runway plus the securitization strategy is there any missing piece thats left here or are they set harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think theyre pretty much set i think theyre still working through documents all the securitization piece but again tens of in the second quarter to kind of do that first issuance brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc and did pinnacle expand its financing of bhg or was that unchanged harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i dont think it is changed brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay okay and harold i think youve done a good job in terms of orchestrating this shift we see in funding running down some of the cds how much more can you go on the wholesale cd front remind us how large that portfolio is harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah hold on give me a second ill try to dig the numbers appreciate the compliment in front of terry indiscernible m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brock i was kind of hoping for one too if i could get one thatd be good brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc ill work on it harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc the cd book were probably talking about million million pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc million im sorry no wait im sorry im talking to you wrong probably about billion in cds brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc and how much of thats wholesale harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think basically billion is about wholesale ive got billion in brokered and about million call it non core retail about million in that brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc that will be thats kind of my wholesale book brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and terry im not sure this is a compliment but youre obviously no stranger to acquisitions as you looked at the atlanta market clearly youve got a horse there youve found with a leader but how did you evaluate that versus a possible acquisition m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc well i think id say theres two or three things that are important to me goal one is to get to the market weve sort of had it as a target for a long time but the vulnerability really accelerated in atlanta over the last months in the competitive landscape and so it just got important to me to get there not insincere when i say it might be as big an opportunity as the one we seized in nashville so then underneath that obviously we have discussions about ma and about de novo model i think ive said all along id be prepared to go either way and i still say that that would reflect my mindset i wouldve been willing to go either way it gets back to can you hire somebody how big a book can they build and then if you do an ma transaction what are all the implications of that whats the price going to be whats the accretion going to be all those kinds of things and so at least at this moment the de novo start felt best to us brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 got it okay thanks for taking my questions m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc all right operator thank you our next question comes from tyler stafford with stephens tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey good morning guys m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey tyler tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc hey just two more for me i just wanted to follow up on the inclusion of the core deposit growth within the incentive plan how much weighting does that carry in the plan this year m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc itll be a similar weighting to the revenue share that weve had in prior years so itll be around or so tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay and then i just wanted to clarify as you guys pencil out the year with the guidance and outlook youve laid out you do think that you can get back within your roaa and rotce target range over the next couple of quarters with that july and november cut assumption harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think so i think the roaa target will be a little it will be a little easier than rotce target but we still think that our modeling shows that well get back within tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay should there be any much balance sheet the difference between kind of loan growth and overall balance sheet growth would that differ much or total balance sheet growth just still be kind of high single digits low double digits harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah i think balance sheet growth and loan growth will run kind of similar growth rates pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 tyler stafford q analyst stephens inc okay all right thanks harold harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc all right thanks tyler operator thank you our next question comes from brian martin with janney montgomery brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey guys good morning harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian m terry turner a president chief executive officer director pinnacle financial partners inc hey brian brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey harold just one thing back to the margin i mean if you get the two cuts if you dont get the two cuts that you expect i guess is there are upside to the margin is that how we should think about it given kind of what youve the plans youve outlined harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc it sounds like stable with the cuts and then maybe some upside if you dont get the cuts harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc i think it is that way i think theres going to be a slight positive to a no cut environment or flat fed funds rate for the year we did a lot of work last year that to like i said remove asset sensitivity so i think were much more neutral with respect to interest rate risk management issue brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc pinnacle financial partners inc pnfp corrected transcript q4 earnings call 22jan2020 okay perfect then i think you said on the expense outlook its a midsingledigit growth rate is that off of and does that include the atlanta build out the cost for that harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc yeah its off of the fourth quarter run rate brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay harold r carpenter a chief financial officer pinnacle financial partners inc and its got a component in their port land brian martin q analyst janney montgomery scott llc okay all right and then last thing on the clarification on bhg i think the revenues in i thought your comment was that the revenues in bhg are up to
