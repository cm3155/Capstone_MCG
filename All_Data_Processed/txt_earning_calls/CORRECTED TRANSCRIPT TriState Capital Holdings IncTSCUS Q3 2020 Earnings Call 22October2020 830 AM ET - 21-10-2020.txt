mr getz james f getz chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning and thank you for joining us were very proud of what tristate capitals team has accomplished for our clients and shareholders in these extraordinary times delivering financial results that reflect the power of our adaptive and scalable franchise all three of our business lines investment management private banking and commercial banking are functioning extremely well and growing handily in the atmosphere that we find ourselves operating while maintaining superior asset quality metrics and optimizing our balance sheet this is a company that is nimble and has a predisposition toward action and delivering responsible growth we believe there are many highly positive developments worth discussing but since we hosted a call just last week to announce our million growth capital raise ill keep our prepared remarks brief to provide additional time for discussion during qa today our third quarter performance was highlighted by total revenue of nearly million up from both the linked and yearago periods supporting yeartodate revenue growth by more than growth in chartwell assets under management to prepandemic levels and very healthy positive net inflows of client assets and continued strong investment performance annualized total deposit growth of during the quarter with growth in strategic treasury management deposits annualized loan growth of some during the quarter with national private banking loans continuing to expand at a strong clip to record levels and commercial growth from very high quality borrowers within our regional footprint and a continuation of our superior credit metrics additionally covid19 related deferrals declined more than earlier forecasted todate our increased provision brought the allowance within range of our yearend estimate when we intend to adopt the cecl accounting methodology today this company includes nearly billion asset bank and a billion aum asset manager as we continue to manage through this historic low rate environment the power of our asset management and swap feegenerating offerings shines through with noninterest income that made up of revenue for the quarter our branchless business model which serves a regional commercial footprint and clients nationwide through private banking and investment management is very well positioned for longterm responsible growth our chartwell investment management subsidiary is in as strong a position as its ever been assets under management net flows and institutional pipeline to chartwell continued to grow in the third quarter driven by a very solid performance by our strategies relative to industry benchmarks for the three years ended september of our strategies outperformed the relative benchmarks and outperformed them for a fiveyear period positive net flows are up organically yeartodate our institutional new business pipeline which includes business that has been won but not yet funded currently exceeds million tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 chartwells annual run rate revenue continues to grow to million as of september and with strategic decisions made during the past months to reduce expenses for this business segment chartwell ebitda in the last three months hit its highest level in five quarters meanwhile tristate capital bank again delivered doubledigit loan and deposit growth as it continued to expand the number and depth of its banking relationships quarterly deposit growth of annualized to more than billion at september supported a loantodeposit ratio of about this deposit growth included expanded treasury management deposit accounts which had been an ongoing and strategic focus of our company on a national level as well as continued progress and broadening the overall client base for our deposit to that end cost of deposits averaged basis points during the three months ended september and overall cost of funds decreased to basis points for the period we believe our model positions us to be agile in managing interest expense through volumes and rates on existing and new liquidity as we move through the next phases of the recovery our private banking business continues to set us apart from peers and the industry in terms of both its contributions to our balance sheet and to our low credit costs these loans which made up more than of total loans at september increased an annualized during the third quarter our potential to continue growing this business has been outstanding as demonstrated by the acceleration of growth in our referral network grows consistently each quarter private bank loan applications were up during the third quarter and yearoveryear to new record levels we also continue to increase our number of financial intermediary firms which is now at our very strong and diversified regional middlemarket commercial banking business also performed well in the third quarter commercial loans grew during the quarter we saw healthy commercial and industrial new loan and originations including our equipment finance offering offset by amortization payments on the portfolio and expansion in our fund finance offering related to capital call and liquidity facilities offset by amortization payments and normal pay downs in the existing portfolio of revolving lines of credit this resulted in a modest decline in ci balances from june commercial real estate loans grew million primarily through new fundings for our existing and known clients showing strong borrower conviction and balance sheets this growth also reflects lower offsetting reductions from payoffs and pay downs which as expected were approximately of last years pace as we outlined last quarter we have limited exposure to some of the businesses that have been more negatively impacted by covid19 including hotels restaurants senior housing and healthcare real estate nonrenewable energy and retail commercial real estate these industries together accounted for of total loans at september and reflect the strong portfolio management and fundamental underwriting we employed for all lending we are pleased with the positive trends weve seen with respect to covid19related deferrals as of october we had deferral arrangements in place with loans totaling million representing of total loan balances this is down from the modest levels we updated you on in april and july the pace of deferral exits is ahead of our earlier forecasts were proud to be a source of support and stability to our clients as they manage their businesses through the ongoing public health and economic crisis tristate capitals credit metrics continue to be a major differentiator and we believe that we become even more evident moving forward in the current economic environment on our billion loan portfolio nonperforming loans of million primarily relate to a single cre loan which we note was not a part of the deferral program all loans were paying as agreed and we reported zero net chargeoffs in the third quarter we increased our tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 allowance for loan losses by over the last year and during the third quarter to million we believe weve conservatively built general reserves reflecting the differentiated and exceptional quality of our loan portfolio the majority of which constitutes private banking loans that are primarily collateralized by marketable securities as we previously shared with you our estimate for allowance at yearend when we intend to adopt cecl is a range between about million to million this would represent about to basis points of commercial loans with each of our investment management private banking and commercial banking businesses performing at very high levels and serving great growing numbers of clients and financial intermediaries we truly believe the growth opportunities for this company have never been more clear or more attainable than at this moment and we now have the capital needed to seize those opportunities and drive meaningful earnings growth in the future for the benefit of all our shareholders as we announced last week tristate capital signed a definitive agreement to raise million of new capital from funds managed by stone point capital the financial servicesfocused private equity firm has extensive experience working with bestinclass financial institutions and we are confident that they understand and fully believe our companys ability to deliver longterm growth including this latest investment which we expect to close in the fourth quarter weve raised more than million in capital in alone during the year when many companies are simply trying to weather the storm tristate capital is on course to continue a record of execution growing total assets next year by another billion to billion support our exceptional doubledigit organic loan growth to sophisticated private banking and commercial clients continue to invest in the proprietary technology and superior talent that has enabled us to become the dominant independent provider of securitiesbased lending to financial intermediaries and their highnet worth clients and continue to grow chartwell investment partners organically and opportunistically through acquisition ours is a business model thats been built tested and refined over the last years to deliver responsible growth in any environment our strong and liquid balance sheet scalable and capitalefficient businesses and branchless model that serves as a regional and national footprint positions tristate capital to adapt to the exceptional business conditions were all facing and succeed over the long term we believe that our valuation should better reflect our ph above peer opportunities operator that concludes my prepared remarks would you kindly open the lines tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 question and answer section operator we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question is from michael perito of kbw please go ahead james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning michael michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey jim david good morning how are you both james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc good thanks for taking my questions i wanted to obviously we just spoke a little while ago after the capital raise but i wanted to maybe expand upon the profitability conversation we started a couple of weeks ago and i guess first i just was curious can you break out i know i believe in your segment reporting you dont necessarily look at it this broken out but can you talk a little bit about kind of what type of roa that the private banking business is generally putting off today and then the second part of the question is this what are the levers with the race to zero we talked about the inflection point on the capital call but can you maybe give us a little bit more details about what some of the levers are and what some of the drivers are of that profitability inflection point and where we can maybe expect that number to start trending as we move forward james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah michael this is jim as a result of few of the communications that we had this morning from the analysts that made my early morning reading i thought it would be helpful to give you a clear articulation of how we look at this quarter and year from a business perspective that blends into what youre indicating and then ph this will give you some specific answers on what your question is let me provide you with a couple of sound bites of what has been accomplished we are positioning this company for success in the future at times decisions will be made that may impact nearterm performance but have long term positive implications now let me give you a couple of observations to reinforce this look at the commitment this company has made to technology we determined on our income statement to really characterize technology very clearly in on there and youll notice that over the past several quarters since we initiated this this year were spending about million on a quarterly basis and im going to give you a little more details of what that has resulted in since there is some concern about the expenses but note the credit experience that our clients have had not just for a quarter not just for a year for multiple years our investors and how the credit experience has been highly tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 positive we have one nonaccrual loan in place in billion loan portfolio we have million of classified loans and we have this quarter no accrual loans days or more delinquent but that hasnt been just this quarter its been multiple quarters over the years no bank has comparable organic loan growth or credit metrics quarterafterquarter and yearafteryear and in the years of existence of this company weve had all of million of net chargeoffs we regret that but its a relatively low number relative to the industry our extraordinary deposit growth without a branch system is by design from a risk management standpoint and serves us well as an ongoing funding mechanism look at the deferrals our folks reached out and met with these clients in february and march and as you note theyve been reduced to of the loan portfolio from initially the investment portfolio were growing handily is a risk management mechanism some of you may have noticed we put forward a gain in that portfolio of some million this quarter let me tell you what drove that we made a determination that the corporate bonds in that portfolio were overpriced we took advantage of the gain and we sold out at that point and if you would look at the corporate bond market today we made a right decision at that point and what we invested in were governments and reduced meaningfully the risk profile of that portfolio by design million of additional growth capital was just recently raised weve raised million of growth capital in the past nine months all to prepare to position this company going into the new year and into the future we have significant opportunities have been executed on in the past months and reflected in the growth numbers across all three of these businesses every once in a while a business is out of sync but in this year all three of these businesses have been robust the balance sheet is strong as its ever been of the loans have liquid collateral thats priced daily and over collateralized theres probably not a single bank in this country that of their loans are priced every single day and the collateral is liquid and counted noninterest income of our revenue another reduction of the risk profile and to take a keep in mind when were raising money whether itd be through fee income or interest income its not instant gratification it takes a year to feel the full impact of that money coming in ph thus theyre dropping dramatically technology what we were just talking about is accelerating the growth from a robotic standpoint were putting in place robotics in order to supplement the professionals that we have in place on the administrative side of it we have a commitment to a lending platform that were helping to fund with indiscernible and this is a lending platform on the commercial banking side its three years out to be delivered and thats how we look at planning in that regard and the digital lending platform that we have in place is supporting about of our clients at this point and the next point is quite important our revenue our revenue is up yeartodate over the past nine months assets under management have fully recovered from the march debacle in the marketplace and growing meaningfully with indiscernible so the point of what im illustrating here is we have in place a strong foundation for the future a billion bank and a billion money management firm going into and beyond and what we ask ourselves and this is most important is what needs to exist to take this company from a billion bank to a billion bank and a billion money management firm to a billion money management firm over the next several years in a responsible manner david tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc mike good morning i dont have specific numbers to share with you but let me share with you a couple of themes and then let me wrap it up with a comment first of all im not sure that in all cases people look at their credit quality and the net interest margin together as it relates to private banking i think that gets disaggregated sometimes right so you really need to think about those two because they those two together because they really work in unison with one another in terms of the credit quality being a driver of the overall return of that particular business weve also been very successful in dropping deposit costs meaningfully in private banking this year and so thats been helpful and while i dont have specific numbers for you we are looking at better ways to tell our story in terms of the individual businesses one of the other stories that i think we can do a better job of telling is the free cash flow that chartwell is generating they have added their ebitda last quarter was million its million this quarter we see that going to above indiscernible and those ebitda margins going from sort of high teens to mid next year and so there are some things that were working on to think about how to better portray some of the drivers of this business and so dont have specific numbers for you today but stay tuned brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc yeah and mike this is brian i would add i think certainly when we look at it we are seeing improved yields and spreads for allin yields across all of the categories commercial and private bank so we believe that as cost to deposits in particular comes down costs of funds obviously lagging a bit as we roll in the cost of capital that weve raised but as you look at those categories we think that there are significant levers to enhance roa there one of those obviously is cost to deposits the next is volume management we believe that theres a lot of volume management that well continue to do within the franchise both particularly over the next two quarters i mean absorb the indiscernible to respond to the sort of situation we had going on in the pandemic and just recovery in markets others utilization rates through that business so utilization rates being a client engagement client education so that obviously driving revenue through existing clients are already on the books will be a significant piece as jim mentioned scalability is huge business so thats a big lever so really when we look at roa i think if you wanted to say its a nineinning game were second third inning in what we think we can drive through the business michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great that was helpful thank you all and then just as a followup kind of staying on the similar topic jim you mentioned kind of some of the investments and why you guys are making them but just if we just look at the model for a second here and just look at the expenses that million core in the third quarter jim or david or brian any broader specific thoughts about kind of where we can expect that to trend moving forward i mean it seemed like if im interpreting your comments correctly like there were some i dont know if pull forward is the right word but some investments that you guys thought were necessary to make and we shouldnt tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 necessarily envision expenses growing at that type of rate but just any more specifics or detail you could put around the numbers that would be great james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah i think the one thing before i turn it over to david id like to point out is the compensation program and weve talked before that what we have in place here every individual that works at this company is on some type of formulaic program and including our relationship managers and the sales personnel at chartwell and i was alluding to in my earlier comments business has brought in the full implications that business may take a year or so to come into play whether it be a loan a deposit an investment in one of our funds in that regard and thats why you see the what you noticed in the compensation aspect of it david can address the others or even maybe give you a little more color on the compensation but obviously we had a very good quarter from the standpoint of raising up assets on the lending side and also in the investment management side and that impacted us immediately on accruing for yearend bonuses but it did not its not reflected in the income statement as of right now david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so mike let me touch on a few themes here in terms of expense growth youve heard jim talk a few minutes ago about our ability to grow tristate in the current environment the growth has driven some expenses higher as you point out as we position the company for what we feel is a very strong fourth quarter and strong next year and so to put some things in context one of the primary increases this year compared to last is in the fdic insurance premium which were was noted in some of the earlier reporting this morning on us its a bit distorted last year we received million credit in conjunction with the fdic reserves hitting their targeted levels their thresholds and so netnet that expense is about is up about million yearoveryear another thing thats a bit distortive is the state capital shares tax last year third quarter we benefited from a tax refund that we received of approximately weve got expense this quarter and so netnet there is about million swing there jim just commented on and weve shared with you in the past that we have a highly variable nature of compensation here at tristate sales employees earn a salary thats fixed and most of their compensation is performancebased we had solid results this quarter and this year in swap income loan growth and deposit growth and these sales efforts will drive results in nii as jim indicated in the current quarter fourth quarter and next year weve also incurred some expenses in the surge resources to handle some of the operational elements of our growth this year to keep things in perspective compensation last year increased meaningfully from the second to third quarter as the formulaic sales targets were achieved and i might also add that compensation expense this quarter is very similar to third quarter last year its actually a bit lower professional fees are higher this year as we prepare to cross the billion threshold weve been very deliberate in our planning and have involved some outside resources to assess our readiness and make sure were wellprepared from a compliance and risk management standpoint and finally let me comment on other operating expenses theres two very important priorities at play here employee wellbeing is an absolute priority of ours weve implemented a number of protocols in the current environment to keep our employees safe and thats driven some expense increase weve also been very focused tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 on the wellness of our communities and have meaningfully increased our charitable contributions this year to worthy causes nominated by our employees and so thats a bit of context in terms of the quarter as we look forward if we hit sales targets you will see compensation stay at these levels but most other expenses that growth should be modest quarteroverquarter michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it so if you guys continue to grow obviously comp will continue to grow but some of the jumps elsewhere certainly should be behind you although not necessarily that the numbers will revert back down its just the growth rates should drop off pretty significantly david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc thats exactly it michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay excellent thank you guys very much i appreciate all the color james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thanks operator the next question is from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc hey great thanks good morning everybody i wanted to go to credit and your allowance levels are now at million which i think is the lower end of that cecl adoption range weve discussed now for a few quarters so with that do you think this allowance build that weve seen in the last few quarters is now complete for the most part just trying to get a better idea of what the future provision expense will look like over the next few quarters thanks david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc matt good morning jim and brian have both talked about our credit quality here a little bit this morning our credit quality in our business model we think speaks for itself over the past years tristate has only charged off million of loans were very pleased with the overall credit portfolio which is driven by a seasoned team and a lot of focus on strength of sponsor classified credits are still very low and were very pleased with the progression of the deferrals as jim pointed out youve also heard jim comment on the fact that were in line with the estimate on cecl as of december we believe looking into that it will be a better year economically and the cecl models will reflect a more favorable environment and so we believe provisions will come down meaningfully next year as we look to indiscernible improvement in the economy tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 matt olney q analyst stephens inc got it okay thanks and then what about the interestbearing deposits that those ph bottomed back in around bps can you talk about the ability to kind of get that down to similar levels over the next few quarters david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc sorry matt there was some feedback could you repeat that please matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay can you hear me okay david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah we can hear you now there were some other noise in the background for some reason matt olney q analyst stephens inc im sorry interestbearing deposit costs you talked about bringing those down in the next few quarters and having some more room to go back in timeframe i think that bottomed around bps or so just curious if you think you can get down to similar levels again this cycle obviously its a much bigger balance sheet just looking for some puts and takes about if you can get down to similar levels again this cycle david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc let me give you the shortest answer on one of these calls we think we can yes matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay great thank you operator operator instructions the next question is from daniel tamayo of raymond james please go ahead daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys how are you james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc indiscernible tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to kind of follow up a little bit or talk a little bit more about the margin youve talked about hoping to get a get back to the range by the end of next year and in the release you mentioned that you should see expansion starting here in the fourth quarter but can you just talk a little bit about what type of interest rate assumptions are in that and then what you would see i know you touched on this on the capital call last month but what you would see or what you would expect with no kind of change to the current interest rate environment david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so danny maybe ill start and then ill ask brian to comment on sort of where loan yields are for the current book and new loans we were putting on and so we had some nim compression from to during the quarter our deposit teams are out there working on relationships that take time to develop and in areas like treasury management and private banking and we had opportunities to add some large relationships this quarter and so we took advantage of that we really feel were poised for good growth in the quarter fourth quarter and next year and that includes our expansion of nim and we raised the capital and liquidity this year and it takes some time to put that to work the subordinated debt will get more fully deployed here soon weve raised a lot of liquidity in deposits that will get put to use in loan growth and to a lesser extent in the bond portfolio and we will continue to review discretionary price deposits and make adjustments where warranted and so i think weve shared with you in the past a year from now we expect our nim to be somewhere in the range and in current in terms of current pricing maybe ill ask brian to join me and comment on that brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc yes thanks yes i think again staying on the deposit side obviously we are we do look at as we look at it in terms of providing us a couple of opportunities for acceleration just like other industries have and one thing its accelerated we believe is our ability to answer the question how do you fund loan growth in billion to billion range per year and i think that showed us showed a lot of people how exactly we do that the timing of those things obviously we think were pretty efficient about it we dealt with obviously some exogenous events that arent normalized business situations in but we think as we look forward here again our ability to be agile and efficient in timing deposits coming on in concert with the opportunities for us in the loan growth and the investment side yeah will continue to improve so thats just the volume side which were estimating as sort of probably basis points of nim in the third quarter so when you look at that plus our normal what we do believe we can do on the pricing side and just the composition including through treasury management and continue to work with our clients which will be a premium to market but obviously market coming in and premiums are relative so we believe we can sustain the brand sustain the client names weve built here and still improve the cost of deposits and then as david said cost of funds continues to sort of spread out as we deploy the capital on the loan side i think were seeing generally speaking were pretty happy with the cost of the yields that were getting between floors and spreads at this point were seeing consistent with last quarter our ci loans probably in the to range cre is probably in the to range and private banking in the to range from again allin yields with floors and spreads tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 so we think its a pretty favorable environment right now to be in the markets where we are to work with our existing clients were getting good opportunities they have high conviction and were getting correspondingly good pricing at this point in the cycle so we do look at that as the some of the levers for nim expansion in the next four quarters daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great thank you for all the color there and then changing gears here just quickly if you could give as much details as youre able to on the composition of the remaining deferrals thanks david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc yes so as we look at it again we have a bit of its still its sort of a twothirds cre composition as we roll through the fourth quarter here as we look forward to getting through the fourth quarter it probably will shift mainly into cre we expect that to be under of total loans as we exit the quarter so but what were what we are pleased with again we didnt set up the deferral program as a risk management tool per se it was a way to work with our clients and i think as jim characterized it in the first quarter it was a way for us to invest alongside our clients to help bridge them to a more stabilized economy were pleased with the way they have managed their businesses and as theyre able to return to normal loan payments and this is just anecdotal i dont have total numbers on you but for you but we do have a number of clients that are actually repaying the deferred balances which is promising and also a testament of sort of the conviction of type of clients that we work with so that suggests obviously cash flows are good ph that conviction is high to meet the obligations and theyre seeing a bit of a normalized business environment but composition here pretty similar to what we talked about for twothirds real estate onethird ci but again thatll change thatll shift a little bit primarily to cre as we exit the year and but well end up with a much smaller number obviously as total loans as we indiscernible quarter daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc great thank you operator the next question is from russell gunther of da davidson please go ahead russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co good morning guys i just wanted to follow up on the ci conversation appreciate the color about the dynamics at play this quarter could you touch on catalysts for growth in that loan vertical going forward i think equipment finance typically has a good but any additional color there would be appreciated brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc yes i mean you picked up well the third quarter was pretty good for equipment finance the fourth quarter is generally a good quarter for equipment finance i mean we obviously look at ways to continue to spread that tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 across the year but yeah we do it we expect the fourth quarter this year to be another solid one for equipment finance if you look at the second quarter to the third quarter a bit of that as we indicated as our loan growth there was offset a bit by obviously some amortization payments pay downs on the revolvers were primarily in our fund financed business really and so thats fairly idiosyncratic we had a nice balance in there at the end of the second quarter and a number of those just got paid down at the same time in the third quarter so we expect utilization there to pick up in the fourth quarter overall we look at more of a normalized average outstanding rate in that business particularly as we continue to grow it and we look at our fund financed business combined with our liquidity facilities and our brokerdealer and other financial institution business is probably approaching million in commitments so as we continue to grow that and have a bit more of a normalized consistent constant outstanding there thatll provide a little bit more on the average assets outstanding basis but so those are levers of growth but i will say we are probably more performing better than expected on even traditional ci business so we are seeing opportunities with existing businesses that are looking to move banking relationships as some of their other banks to either focus internally or just reposition their focus on business so again in this middlemarket space where we do really well some of the really large banks are potentially losing focus on some of these middlemarket clients and so we are seeing opportunities in our traditional ci more than i think we would have expected two quarters ago russell e t gunther q analyst da davidson co i appreciate the color there brian thank you and then just my only remaining question is a tickytacky one on the tax rate outlook for the fourth quarter thank you david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc russell happy to try to answer that question as we shared with you we strive to have an effective tax rate somewhere in the midteens the tax rate is driven in part by tax credits which as weve shared happen episodically its been a quiet year on that front there may be an opportunity or two here in the fourth quarter that will develop well have to see if that holds true and see how things progress from here and so we continue to strive for a tax rate in the midteens and well just well see if were able to get there by yearend or not operator the next question is a followup from matt olney of stephens please go ahead matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks for taking the followup just want to drill down more on loan yields i think the overall yields are now and i think it was brian that gave us the pricing by loan type im having a hard time reconciling these various ranges to the overall loan yields of what am i missing is there some notable exception pricing im just having a hard time appreciating why the yields are where they are versus the ranges that brian gave us brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 yeah i mean i think i mean part of that obviously is were talking about new business coming on relative to the historic book which obviously were tailwagging dog sort of thing right so yeah were making meaningful contributions every quarter and then were growing million a quarter were certainly that lever becomes more powerful and will have a continued bigger impact on there with those four opportunities for example that we did put in on the private bank business and some other businesses historically those are being deployed on the commercial side and are pretty standard in the market at this point so again well we believe well see yields continue to push up a bit from here but again its the new contributions to yield obviously takes some time to change the overall complexity for the overall makeup of the loan yields but were certainly not seeing not going to see compression of that loan yield which is pretty stabilized at this point with forwardupward motion there matt olney q analyst stephens inc is there any color you can give us on what the new and renewed loan yields were in the third quarter of the growth that you guys had brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc yeah those i mean those yields that i gave you are pretty indicative of that so on the ci side again i mean obviously fairly general and broad from for a variety of reasons but to on the ci side to on the cre side primarily was some were higher than that and then on next on the private bank side to type range so to your point there will be some idiosyncratic things that happen again in a quarter yeah within each of those businesses but those are averages average range that we think are pretty indicative of whats coming on so again that even in a quarter where we did million but were talking about million underneath billion bulk rate so itll take some time to continue to make those adjustments matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks brian and then shifting over to chartwell saw some really good improvements in this quarter revenue and ebitda it sounds like you expect incremental improvements even from here i think the margin moving from to and quarterly ebitda moving up to million those would each be really good improvements to see any more color on timing of when you expect this or details of how you expect to get there thanks james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc yeah a lot of it matt has to do with the perfection of the distribution model that we have in place there now as i had mentioned we currently have over million of institutional business that should be converted in the fourth quarter its a little more difficult converting this business quickly because most of the people were dealing with theyre working remotely but both the institutional and the retail sales force have done a tremendous job in a difficult environment that we find ourselves in retail business is about a little over of the assets so youre going to continue to see a lot of positive activity coming out of chartwell just look at the type of investment performance that we have and thats what these folks are selling and we have it pretty broadly quality investment performance so were looking forward to a successful year tim and his team have really done a nice job and i believe youll see the ebitda continuing to improve along with revenue growth over the next several quarters tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats all for me thank you operator the next question comes from joe plevelich of boenning scattergood please go ahead joseph m plevelich q analyst boenning scattergood inc good morning just a quick question on the incremental cost as we breached the billion asset threshold do you have a rough idea of what that might be or are there some other opportunities to perhaps offset some of those costs david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc so joe those costs are largely onetime in nature right there were costs to prepare to get over billion they were cost to do gap analysis and assessments making sure weve got the right systems in place from a compliance from a regulatory risk management perspective capital management and the other models that maybe well start to focus on as we cross billion and so those are more onetime in nature as we get above billion i would remind folks that we dont have a retail franchise right and so interchange fees and some of the other costs will not be as impactful to ph offset us to a typical bank across to billion and we dont have a retail franchise and so some of the other cost just wont be all that impactful so were actually looking forward to crossing billion and hope to be there soon brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc yeah and i think i would just add on so that certainly shows up on the professional fees and maybe some of the other expense i think the as we look at some of the other adjustments that weve made weve added a lot of we have added people to the team i think were excited about the contributions that everyone is bringing that weve added on so weve taken a run at it weve continued to expand the expertise of the team and people are not just contributing within a vertical its everybody is really contributing to make us better and so were i think as david said were excited about the return on the investment to sort of getting over billion were actually really excited about the talent and people as well as some of the technology weve added to get over there so indiscernible thatll be onetime charges particularly on the professional fees and opex the other expense joseph m plevelich q analyst boenning scattergood inc gentlemen my other question is just so the fdic insurance expense debt that there was nothing funky or elevated this quarter thats a good run rate here or could this somehow moderate david j demas a chief financial officer tristate capital holdings inc youll see some modest moderation some slight moderation the average balances as average balances sort of settle in youll see some moderation there there was quite a growth here in the past quarter or two in terms of tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 22oct2020 some of those balances and the way they came on but thatll change and i think i shared earlier that the comparison yearoveryear is a little bit tough because of the refund last year by the fdic but the pace of growth in the fdic insurance premium should level off from here brian s fetterolf a director president chief executive officer tristate capital bank inc and obviously yeah average assets obviously unique this year particularly the last two quarters being driven more by liquidity than loans right so we went we were down at loantodeposit again that average assets being the fundamental base of fdic insurance well continue to use those deposits and sort of go within the business within the growth were expecting over the next two quarters or so so i think as you pointed out the rate of growth in the fdic insurance will slow particularly compared to revenue joseph m plevelich q analyst boenning scattergood inc thanks james f getz a chairman of the board president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to jim getz for closing remarks james f getz chairman of the
