chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you travis in the third quarter of valley reported net income of million and earnings per share of exclusive of noncore items adjusted net income and eps were million and respectively our quarterly results were highlighted by organic capital growth sound asset quality metrics improved core deposit flows and solid expense control the current interest rate environment reflective of an inverted curve has challenged traditional banking models and we have not been insulated from these pressures that said while the duration of the current inversion has exceeded original expectations and is anticipated to continue for the foreseeable future we do not intend to change our foundational business model our net interest income declined at a much lower pace in the recent quarters and we believe that nii is near the bottom of its decline all else equal while the external environment remains fluid our focus on executing our strategic initiatives remains steadfast one of our strategic efforts over the last few years has been to transform our core operating environment to allow flexibility in integrating unique delivery channels enhancing fintech integrations and positioning the bank for scalability without the traditional technology expense hurdles im pleased to report that during the first weekend of october our team worked tirelessly to complete the transformational conversion of our core operating system this was a massive undertaking which required months of planning development and testing valley is now operating on a single system with bespoke delivery channels and i couldnt be prouder of our disciplined ability to execute on this project which i reiterate was done in the face of an extremely challenging operating environment this technology conversion is a natural progression of a cultural revolution that has occurred over the last few years we have collectively developed a growthoriented mindset which has been evident in our recent financial results to support this mindset we continuously strengthen and develop our capabilities to bring us more in line with the largest players in our industry our bankers now have a more robust infrastructure and we expect to see significant opportunities to leverage these new technologies and drive additional growth as the environment normalizes our successful conversion was yet another example of our discipline and proven ability to execute as we enter we anticipate generating both expense efficiencies and revenue scale resulting from our common core platform as we have moved to a cloudbased infrastructure were not burdened with the massive hardware cost that are typically associated with type of technology investment we are more nimble today than we were a month ago and the opportunities ahead of us remain significant with that i will turn the call over to tom and mike to discuss the quarters growth and financial results thomas a iadanza president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thank you ira slide illustrates the approximately million of total deposit growth during the quarter we experienced strong growth in interest bearing transaction account and retail cds which offset noninterest bearing deposit declines and indirect cd maturities the pace of noninterest bearing deposit runoff has slowed but mix shift to interest bearing products has continued to weigh on our total deposit cost slide provides more detail on the continued diversity of our deposit portfolio during the quarter we benefited from stability in our branchbased deposits and strong growth in our specialized verticals inflows were particularly strong in our national deposits business and through our online channel these dynamics enabled us to pay off some maturing indirect cds during the quarter we also continued to reduce our adjusted uninsured deposit exposure and have significant coverage with cash and high quality liquidity slide further illustrates the diversity and granularity of our deposit base no single commercial industry accounts for more than of our deposit our government portfolio remains diversified across our footprint and is fully collateralized relative to state collateral requirements now turning to slide you can see an overview of our loan growth and portfolio composition annualized loan growth on a yeartodate basis has slowed consistently as the year has progressed originations declined meaningfully during the quarter as we require wider spreads on new loans these efforts continue to result in higher new origination yields slide breaks down the diversity of our commercial real estate portfolio by collateral type and geography as a reminder we have an extremely granular loan portfolio with an average loan size of roughly million from a metric perspective our weighted average ltv remains at as interest rates have increased debt service coverage ratios have declined somewhat to times we continue to closely monitor pools of maturing and resetting loans and believe that our borrowers are well positioned to absorb the pass through of higher rates this reflects consistent underwriting discipline at conservative cap rates and significant stress testing efforts at origination the following slide illustrates the continued strong metrics and granular composition of our diverse office portfolio with that i will turn the call over to mike hagedorn to provide additional insight on the quarters financial michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thanks tom slide illustrates valleys recent quarterly net interest income and margin trends the sequential million decline in net interest income was less than half of the reduction experienced in the second quarter of the year while asset yields continue to improve continued pricing competition and mix shift drove funding costs higher on the second quarter call we indicated that we were observing signs of net interest income stabilization during the quarter monthly net interest income was generally stable and higher than the june level our fully tax equivalent net interest margin declined a modest basis points on a linked quarter basis versus basis points in the second quarter of and has been generally stable over the last few months all else equal we expect fourth quarter net interest income to be relatively in line with the third quarter level by the end of the quarter our liquidity position has been effectively normalized absent abnormal environmental factors we expect cash to remain generally consistent with third quarter levels moving to slide we generated nearly million of noninterest income for the quarter as compared to million in the second quarter exclusive of approximately million of noncore items adjusted noninterest valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 income was closer to million for the quarter the decline was primarily related to lower capital markets fees associated with our slower loan growth other business lines were generally stable on slide you can see that our noninterest expenses were approximately million for the quarter or approximately million on an adjusted basis adjusted expenses declined from the prior quarter despite an increase in certain technology costs partially associated with our successful core conversion specifically we began to see the benefits of recent head count reductions about midway through the quarter fdic assessment costs and outside consulting fees also declined on a sequential basis we continue to execute on previously identified efforts to slow future expense growth legacy valley and leumi have now joined on a common core after a certain adjustment period we expect the core conversion to result in the next wave of previously announced cost savings early in the new year to reiterate our focus is on controlling expenses in the face of revenue pressures which have resulted from the inverted yield curve turning to slide you can see our asset quality trends for the last five quarters nonaccrual loans have been effectively flat for the last three quarters early stage delinquencies ticked up during the quarter but remain well below the average level of the last months third quarter net chargeoffs declined somewhat from recent levels on slide you can see that tangible book value increased approximately for the quarter and is up nearly from a year ago our balance sheet positioning has enabled us to avoid the significant challenges that other peers have faced related to the oci impact associated with availableforsale securities we manage all risk areas prudently and are proud in our ability to insulate tangible capital from this headwind tangible common equity to tangible assets increased to during the quarter as a result of our normalized cash position as loan growth slowed our riskbased regulatory capital ratios have increased between and basis points as compared to the second quarter of we continue to prioritize organic capital growth in this challenging environment and are prudently managing our balance sheet to incrementally strengthen our position with that ill turn the call back to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will conduct the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp good morning frank frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co just on the trajectory of niinim i mean you talked about the hopeful trough here in a higher for longer scenario just thinking out into do you think there is some stabilization in nim and then you get a reversal from there so you get a little bit of a trajectory upwards or is it more sort of like in higher for longer sort of bouncing along the bottom for a period of time just wondering your general thoughts there michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp hi frank its mike i think that when you look at the trajectory of nim in as we said in our prepared remarks weve been in that mid2 to low range since april and when you look at the cost of deposits youll notice that from fourth quarter the first quarter they were up basis points from first quarter to second quarter they were up and they were up in the third quarter as well so were starting to see a normalization both in the cost but also in the nim in a higher for longer rate environment i think a couple of things would happen that would all things being equal result in a slightly higher nii and slightly higher nim the first of those and has been true for all of the biggest driver of the compression on our nim has been the rotation out of noninterest bearing and into interest bearing product so i would think in a higher for longer environment there is some place some equilibrium that we see a plateau on that second you got to keep in mind that weve had a very large liquidity build both at the end of the first quarter and throughout the second quarter as a result of all the chaos that was created with the bank failures earlier this year that is completely off our balance sheet as of and then when you go forward and you kind of think about deposits stabilizing i think the thing that will drive at least in our current modeling the thing that will drive nim expansion and nii increases is going to be the repricing on our assets earning assets but more specifically loans and as we look at our modeling we know what our fixed rate book repricing is along with the repricing opportunities that we have throughout and the adjustable rate book so we would expect that to be the main driver of ph any nim expansion next year valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay great appreciate all the color mike and then just as a followup to that in terms of the brokered balances it looks like you guys have had some really good success raising customer deposits and so youve got these roll off i guess do you expect that to continue and if so as you look out the maturation table when do you expect or how quickly do you expect brokered balances to kind of fall here michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yes so our current thinking and our current modeling is that we will see further reduction in our brokered balances and thats certainly one of our goals but i want to make sure everybody understands how weve been using brokered weve been using brokered throughout to fill the gaps especially earlier in the year we had much higher loan growth to fill the gaps on the balance sheet expansion while also paying very close attention that were not repricing the back book of our deposit our core deposit base and then the second thing that weve done is weve used that in those stopgap measures weve used both duration and rate in that portfolio to help manage our nim and nii and so while i know they have a bad connotation sometimes theyve been very effective and the market has been excellent for us to use that in certain times and in certain circumstances and were very effectively frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co and just lastly on that front in terms of as you look at the indirect market versus what youre able to get directly from customers here is there much of a difference in terms of pricing in terms of new brokered versus new direct michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah the inversion of the curve probably is the biggest impact on that if youre talking about exactly the same duration i would say the incremental cost of deposits is fairly close to one another so there may be basis point difference but its not that remarkably different so i think again id go back to my previous comments is you want to use that for both rate and duration but in the case that youre asking about you probably want to manage duration in this inverted curve ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp frank this is ira i would just add to that when we think about the incremental piece of deposits as mike alluded to earlier there were significant demand for us to put some of those incremental deposits on based on the loan growth we were seeing and that obviously ratcheted up the incremental cost of some of these deposits as we now have scaled back some of the loan growth the demand for those brokered deposits and higher cost cds have actually come a bit down and were still originating core deposits i think as we spoke about last time on the call the overall deposit originations for this quarter were around 380ish so up so on a blended basis marginal deposits are coming in much cheaper than what these directs are and as we curtail the loan growth we definitely anticipate some expansion on margin based on that increment will be the loan thats coming on ph sorry folks valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co great okay appreciate all the color guys thanks ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everybody maybe just sticking with the nim can you provide what the monthly nim was across the quarter and is the september the september nim a good launch point into fourth quarter about where it could shake out for the fourth quarter travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp matt this is travis just on a monthly basis july with august and september so when we say it was pretty stable throughout the quarter i mean we really mean it so you can indiscernible september end and the quarter with the same number but yeah thats a good launch point matthew breese q analyst stephens inc thank you and then i was hoping also for some additional color on near term loan growth outlook and maybe perhaps when you would feel comfortable reaccelerating loan growth thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hey matt its tom the loan growth the fact is slowing it down really customer related the uncertainty of the rate market as well as widening spreads has slowed down their activity we still service those valued real estate customers when they need it and we continue to grow that portfolio just had a much slower pace i just want to point out our ci portfolio has grown over the last year so our focus is really on that relationship driven ci piece were still getting higher percent growth in the florida market and stable growth here in the northeast i would expect that growth in the fourth quarter to be in a similar fashion to the third quarter and well be in that range of to for the year matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great okay and then ira just acknowledging yours and valleys relationship with bank leumi and first just wishing everybody on your end and on leumis end the best as they deal with the horrific events over in israel in light of that i was curious if events overseas will have and because of the partnership any impact on your bank balance sheet or private client group in any way valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp thank you very much i appreciate that and all of our employees and clients its been a very difficult time that said bank leumi obviously is a significant partner for us on the participation side we havent seen any interruption as of yet and we continue to anticipate business as usual so but its definitely difficult for a lot of people we still think were going to continue to move forward and not be impacted by it thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah hey matt its tom just kind of give you a little context here the only direct loan exposure we have is to high net worth us citizens and its secured by state of israel bonds as a very very small portfolio otherwise we help finance domestic subsidiaries of israeli companies but its all done here in the us and usbased entities the back and forth and flow of business slows down really based on macroeconomic conditions but its business as usual and working with them on partner transactions matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay and then could you give us some update as to where we are in the previously mentioned cost saving plan i believe it was like million identified last week we spoke it was expected to progress over four quarters how is execution matching up versus planning and is there anything else youve uncovered as youve kind of looked into this in terms of additional cost saves travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp yeah matt its travis in the quarter id say you probably about to of on an annualized basis what we had anticipated i dont expect much incrementally in the fourth quarter postconversion were keeping this four teams stacked up and running but then as we get into the first half of i think thats where you get the next wave which will come from a combination of thirdparty vendors and some additional resource efficiencies so yeah i dont anticipate much in the fourth quarter but again once we get to the first half of i think thats where you see the bulk of whats remaining we are still looking obviously postconversion at opportunities that we hadnt previously identified and so well continue to dig there matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and we should be thinking of this expense plan as one that slows down the natural pickup in expenses versus one that dollarfordollar lowers the run rate correct travis lan a senior vice president directorcorporate finance business development headinvestor relations valley national bancorp thats correct so i mean if you think and this is just high level i dont mean for these to be numbers to take away but historically weve run kind of high singledigits from an operating expense growth perspective as a growth company there are obviously headwinds from an inflation perspective fdic cost regulatory perspective on top of that and then were just trying to work our way back into kind of that midsingledigit expense growth level based on these initiatives valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great last one for me is just i dont know if you have one or not but could you just comment if you do on syndicated loan exposure whats the size of that book how is it performing any other metrics we should be aware of there thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah sure matt its tom again the portfolio is about billion spread over a number of loans were not hlt lenders we dont really have leverage transactions in there theyre mostly closed deals with a small group of banks direct contacts relationships with any of the borrowers in the ph rolling market matthew breese q analyst stephens inc perfect i appreciate it thats all i had thank you thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah and we lead a lot of those transactions also where were not a participant where we tend be the lead bank in over of that operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from michael perito with kbw please go ahead michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp good morning michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i apologize i got on a couple minutes late so if you guys addressed this already i apologize for asking again but just taking into context all the commentary you guys have given around nii and the expense plan kind of execution is it fair for us to be thinking about that the third quarter of as probably the peak in the efficiency ratio here and are you guys at this point able to provide any kind of context around the type of yearonyear improvement youre hoping the expense plan can drive assuming your nii projections kind of play out as you expect them today thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp so i dont think theres any bank cfo that would say that third quarter would tend to be their peak i think fourth quarter tends to be the peak for a lot of reasons right you have yearend expenses that get pushed through valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 theres some bonus accrual work sometimes in the fourth quarter that might drive costs up so i wouldnt necessarily agree with that its third quarter but i would point you back to traviss comments before that if its fourth quarter thats actually the peak again in the first half of we expect to realize the vast majority the remainder in the vast majority of our previously announced cost savings initiatives which in turn would then drive down our efficiency ratio michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thats helpful and then just a couple more quick ones on i think the kind of new york new jersey area of credit commercial real estate dynamics we probably beat the dead horse on that for quite some time now but just curious if you guys can maybe provide some context about updated demographics and trends youre seeing in the florida and alabama market i mean are there similar kind of supply and demand dynamics is there still kind of inflow of population growth and just wondering kind of what the demographics are down there more recently thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah sure michael this is tom the impacts of slowing and higher interest rates are affecting them also the metrics on the transactions we do arent any different they were below loan to value usually or debt service coverage so were still generating transactions with those similar metrics we are seeing continued growth in those markets the population migration has slowed but theres still migration into that florida market our consumer business is strong down there but probably half of what it was in the earlier part of this year its still a growth market for us in all cases but ill continue to point out we underwrite very conservatively in all markets we have floors at our cap rates in all markets we track those cap rates were more suburban than urban were not big players in the miami market were more spread around the six or seven other major areas of florida michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks tom really helpful and then just the last one for me just once again kind of taking into context all your other commentary is it fair for us to be thinking about kind of the asset base to be pretty stable here for the next several quarters and then possibly some lift beyond that assuming the environment is permitting of kind of growth reaccelerating is that similar to how you guys are budgeting it or is there any kind of anything that you would point to that could make it different michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp i think you have it generally right mike i mean i think end of the third quarter our cash position was normalized i think tom referenced the growth that we anticipate in the fourth quarter and then kind of picking up maybe somewhat in but i dont think theres any type of significant other changes that you would see on the balance sheet michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc very good thank you guys i appreciate it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please go ahead jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks good morning everyone thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp hi jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe a question for you mike slide you show the fee income numbers and capital markets being down and you tied it to loan growth what kind of expectations should we have for capital markets and then also curious if theres any kind of expense offset how much bottom line impact there is to lower capital markets fees thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah hey jon its tom yeah the capital markets for us is really been driven by gain on sale in the consumer resi space as well as swaps in the commercial space we expect that to be flat going forward we dont expect any lift there jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp we have other avenues we have a tax advisory business we get a slight uptick in the fourth quarter to get things closed by yearend we continue to build out our fx and trades which shows progress quartertoquarter but were expecting flat into next year jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay okay good credit looks great but some of the accruing past dues are up sequentially anything to note there anything that youre thinking about there that we should be aware of thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 no no im looking at it really its coming out of the consumer and resi bucket on the consumer side its primarily our cash surrender value life insurance business its a matter of liquidating and collecting on there so thats not going to be problematic from any potential loss standpoint on the resi side i just want to point out our levels were abnormally low we are still below where we were a year ago at this point were about million third quarter of were million in third quarter so were really gravitating to more normal levels so no we dont anticipate any problems jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay good and then mike you referenced slide that upper right chart with the deposit cost increases and what do you think that looks like in a quarter or two i mean you referenced million and million for the last two quarters but is that curve bending at all from the million michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp if its bending its ever so slight i think youll see the real bend inflection point happen early next year but you still see some migration its slowed considerably but you still see some migration from noninterest bearing into interest bearing from a incremental next dollar cost of deposit funding and more broadly even liability funding that is definitely stabilized in that mid5ish range jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay all right thank you very much thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp thank you operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc you spoke about getting high yields on new originations and that fixed rate loan repricing will be one of the main drivers of nim expansion from here can you give us some more color on what level of loans are repricing what level loans are repricing at currently and if you could size the amount of fixed rate loans that are coming due over the next year or so valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah its tom here give you some context we repriced about billion of loans for the first nine months of this year the spread it really depends on asset class but the spreads are around the ph or so range we expect that to continue looking forward theres probably another million of reprices over the next six months we expect those spreads to be the same theres also a lot of renewing loans loans that will mature so it tends to be in that billion or so range over the next six months in total michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think that number is a little bit overstated right so we have a little bit understated excuse me so we have about ph million fixed rate portfolio average life has extended to about five years so if you do the math i mean just assuming all else equal youll get about billion a year of fixed rate loans that that come due and would ultimately reprice higher ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp and i think the one other thing if you look at i forget what the slide it is maybe the slide you can look at the credit spreads right so if you go back to just three quarter of and you look at where the new origination yield was versus where the index was youre sitting around a basis point spread and if you do the same math just today youre sitting at about basis point spread so new originations are coming on definitely had a higher spread and as travis and tom both alluded to the repricing is probably going to come on at to basis points above where current rates are today on those so theres a significant pickup when you think about the billion plus or minus of whats going to be the next year michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp this is mike ill just add to what ira said so the simple average of new loan originations in the second quarter was and for the third quarter it was and the last month september that quarter finished just over so clearly were seeing repricing on new loan originations both from the spread increases that both ira and tom mentioned and then also just because of the discipline that we have around here to make sure that were getting paid for the risk were taking thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp and kind of maybe just one final thing i think this is an important piece right when we think about sort of our overall portfolio and how we manage the balance sheet obviously based on sort of the sensitivity that we have there was a decline in the nim maybe earlier than some of our peers were but we do have a significant amount of tailwind coming from the assets that are going to be priced so once we get into a more stable environment whether it is higher for longer or just stable from where we are today there is that tailwind thats going to come from the significant amount of assets and i think that will be a significant positive for us manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thats very helpful and maybe just on the flip side on the funding side the ph or so pricing that you mentioned that deposits are coming on at right now would you be able to provide a breakdown between cds and savings accounts and what those are coming on at right now and also if there is any update to your through the cycle deposit beta guide of around mid thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp so on regular savings accounts youre probably in the mid3ish type category but we also have a high yield savings account out there in our direct channel which is in the mid5 maybe actually low and while we dont have a new cd special we havent had a new one for a while were retaining anywhere from about of all maturing cds so i think that when you think as i said earlier when i talked about the incremental cost of the next dollar of funding its going to be in that mid to low5 range but you got to realize that its in certain pockets within our deposit pricing where weve had some growth that are a little more competitive and thats just for that incremental cd thats coming on i think the bigger piece is that we had our strongest quartertodate of new account opening so now youre seeing a mix shift still continuing and average coming out of the noninterest bearing the number of accounts in noninterest bearing continue to escalate significantly and we were able to grow both consumer and commercial and just as an example in the month of september it was a blended commercial that came on with that rate of ph for our overall deposit base so while mikes correct in looking at some of those cds and what that the specials are keep in mind were still originating and opening core accounts in this organization like we havent ever historically been before and that will have continue to have a positive impact on how we think about what those marginal funding costs are so the marginal funding cost that you saw ph 370ish for the quarter on that blend is something we anticipate to continue assuming interest rates stay at the current levels manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and the through the cycle deposit beta of mid any update on that thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp our through the cycle estimate was for the fourth quarter year to the third quarter were in the mid so its likely that well end up above that but thats factored into all the commentary that weve already given about stable nii in the near term and opportunity to expand nii as we get into manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i appreciate it thank you thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp thanks valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 operator thank you one moment for our next question our next question comes from steve moss with raymond james please go ahead steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp good morning steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc maybe just on good morning on credit here and just to the dynamic of fixed rate loans repricing just curious what you are seeing for the impact on debt service coverage ratios and whats the dynamic of how many clients have to put up additional cash to support a loan or project thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah sure steve its tom as i mentioned earlier we repriced in or reset the rate in on billion of our loans we did not have to modify the contractual payment terms on any of them they just reset flow through with continued pi payments no cash upfront to the customer that need it i want to point out our upfront underwriting underwrites more conservatively typically at times average debt service coverage a ltv so that creates cushion in our upfront analysis steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay but just given that rates have moved up quite a bit here in the last month or two you still expect that dynamic to play out into thomas a iadanza a president valley national bancorp yeah i mean i mentioned earlier i think theres another million that will reset over the next six months we do a forward analysis of this we dont expect any different results or modifications based on that analysis today ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp maybe just highlighting what tom said and you said it twice now and i just want to make sure everyone is hearing what he said we did billion and now one client had to come and bring additional equity into it they reset us to what they were and i think thats something significant when we look at how we underwrite loans day one how we think about resetting these loans and the capacity of our clients to pay and i think thats a big distinction with versus what youre seeing at other organizations today steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 great no i appreciate all the color and then just in terms of as we think about the outlook going forward here just curious ira i know you said youre focused on organic growth and internally but are you seeing more ma opportunities or has any thought process changed here just given the more volatile macro environment ira d robbins a chairman chief executive officer valley national bancorp think on the back end what were seeing with regard to the curve theres going to be definitely a lot more opportunities based on some of the challenges that many banks have that said i think weve been very diligent and disciplined around our tangible book value and to have a deal work in this environment becomes very very challenging so some of the economics need to change if you go back to the tangible book value we had of which was the first quarter that this management team took over we were sitting at they were sitting at which is pretty much of incremental tangible book value when you add in the dividends that we paid out during that same period we have effectively doubled the tangible book value in a year period and i think thats something that this management team is very very proud of we want to make sure as we think about potential acquisitions as we move
