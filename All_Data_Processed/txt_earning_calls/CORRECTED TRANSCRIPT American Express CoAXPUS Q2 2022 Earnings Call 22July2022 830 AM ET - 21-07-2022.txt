it over to steve stephen j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks kerri and welcome to the ir team and your first earnings call and good morning everyone thanks for joining us for our second quarter call we had an outstanding quarter revenues were up reaching a record high and earnings per share were card member spending was at record levels billed business was up from a year earlier on an fx adjusted basis led by a vigorous rebound in travel and entertainment spending and continued strong growth in goods and services we added million new proprietary cards in the quarter driven by continued strong demand for our feebased premium products acquisitions of our us consumer platinum gold and delta cobrand cards were all at record highs customer retention and credit quality both remain at exceptionally strong levels while our strong growth may be somewhat surprising given the uncertainties in the external environment there are number of reasons for our continued momentum american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 first the decisions we made through the pandemic continue to pay dividends at the outset we made it a priority to be there for our customers focusing on delivering great service providing financial relief programs expanding our shop small initiatives and injecting new value into our premium consumer and business products with benefits that were relevant to the times we then ramped up investments early in the recovery to rebuild our momentum and grow our customer base refreshing our premium products with a series of new benefits that enhanced our generational relevance and we accelerated our acquisition these decisions laid the foundation for the strength in customer retention engagement and acquisitions that youve seen over the past year and in our results today other key factors driving our performance include the many competitive advantages that we have that differentiate us as well as several structural shifts of some nearterm recovery tailwinds which youll remember we discussed at our investor day a critical competitive advantage is our global premium customer base which is at scale unrivaled in the industry with millions of highspending super prime loyal consumer and business customers across generations and geographies importantly millennials and gen z consumers are a large part of our existing customer base and our fastestgrowing age cohort making up of all new consumer card members we are requiring and around of the new us consumer platinum and gold card members our new customers have excellent credit profiles are highly engaged in the premium benefits that come with american express membership and are spending more from the start of their relationship with us than previous newcomers giving us a long runway for growth in fact spending by this age group grew in the second quarter significantly outpacing other generations our momentum is also being aided by several structural shifts which we believe give us significant opportunities for growth across all lines of business over the longer term these include growth in the premium consumer card space around the world the ongoing increase in online commerce and digital engagement among consumers the strong pace of small business creation and the acceleration and digitizing of commercial payments finally in the near term we are benefiting from recovery tailwinds in our businesses outside the us in the large and global corporate space and in travel and entertainment the travel rebound in particular has been faster and stronger than anyone expected total te spending exceeded prepandemic levels in april for the first time and was at of levels for the quarter led by strong growth in global consumer and sme spending and a significant uptick in large and global corporate travel and we dont see demand in the te categories declining significantly anytime soon based on the strength of future bookings coming through our consumer travel agency and the trends our partners in the travel industry like delta are experiencing particularly in the premium space of course we are wary of the uncertainties in the current economic environment and the impact its having on our business historically low unemployment rates is a positive factor and its helping to drive our strong credit metrics and we continue to see no significant signs of stress in our consumer base inflation is a bit of a mixed bag its a modest contributor to our strong growth in volumes but inflation when combined with low unemployment also puts pressure on operating costs for example like everyone else were seeing intense competition for the best talent but because our colleagues are a key driver of our success we continue to invest in talent which is having an impact on our operating expenses american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 looking forward as ive emphasized many times before we run the company for the long term and our investment strategy is grounded in this principle as we sit here today we have an abundance of great opportunities and we will continue to make our decisions with a longerterm view like we did during the pandemic that means we will continue to invest at high levels in those areas that will drive sustainable growth including our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage we remain confident that the successful execution of this strategy will position us well as we seek to achieve our longterm growth plan aspirations of revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth in and beyond thank you and ill now turn it over to jeff jeffrey c campbell vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well thank you steve and good morning everyone good to be here to talk about our second quarter results which reflect another strong quarter and great progress against our multiyear growth plan starting with our summary financials on slide most importantly our second quarter revenues were billion up on an fxadjusted basis strengthening sequentially from last quarters already strong yearover year growth rate our reported second quarter net income was billion with earnings per share of now as i said last quarter given that yearoveryear comparisons of net income have been challenging due to the volatility that the pandemic caused in credit reserve adjustments we are including pretax preprovision income as a supplemental disclosure again this quarter which we believe gives you additional insight into the trends of our underlying earnings on this basis second quarter pretax preprovision income was billion up versus the same time period last year so now lets get into a more detailed look at our results beginning with volumes starting on slide you can see the continued momentum in spending from our strong customer base that steve noted earlier billed business and total network volumes were up around yearoveryear on an fxadjusted basis in the second quarter we feel really good about both our yearoveryear growth as well as our sequential growth the second quarter saw us achieving our highestever level of quarterly billed business and if you were to compare to the first quarter was while the second quarter growth rate accelerated even further to importantly our spending volumes strengthened as we went through the quarter with the month of june also reaching a new monthly record high and as we sit here today this momentum has continued into early july now i would point out that when you think about yearoveryear growth rates volumes in were of course in a steep phase of recovery as the year progressed so i do expect that our yearoveryear growth rates will moderate as we progress through the rest of our spending metrics are being driven by both sustained growth in goods and services spending and by an acceleration in te recovery in the second quarter starting first with goods and services spending on slide we saw yearoveryear growth of in the second quarter we are now multiple quarters into seeing the effects of the structural shift in online commerce spending patterns which accelerated by the pandemic with our growth rates remain steady specifically online and cardnotpresent spending grew in the second quarter in contrast total te spending as you see on slide showed an acceleration in its recovery this quarter even more than we and many others wouldve expected reaching of levels the high demand for travel drove a steep recovery across all customer types american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 this strength in both goods and services and te spending is also evident as we break spending trends down across our consumer and commercial businesses with a few other key points that i suggest you take away first beginning on slide millennial and gen z customers continue to drive our highest global consumer billed business growth with their spending up yearoveryear id also call out that this quarter all other age cohorts have now reached prepandemic levels of te spending including baby boomers who had been slower to recover in our commercial business on slide spending from our small and mediumsized enterprise clients continues to drive our overall growth with spending up yearoveryear while a smaller part of our business it is worth noting the significant acceleration in growth of the large and global corporate customers significantly above last quarters growth rate this is a sign of a more meaningful business travel recovery so overall we are pleased that our strengthened spending volumes has exceeded our original expectations for the year and again this quarter the majority of our high level of growth was driven by the number of transactions flowing through our network with some modest additional impact from inflation this positions us well for our long term growth aspirations moving on now to receivable and loan balances on slide we saw good sequential growth in our loan balances which are now well above prepandemic levels this quarter the interestbearing portion of our loan balances also continues to consistently increase quarteroverquarter but remains a bit below levels as paydown rates have remained elevated as you then turn to credit and provisions on slide through the high credit quality of our customer base continues to show through in our extremely strong credit performance card member loans and receivables writeoff and delinquency rates remain well below prepandemic levels and though they did continue to tick up slightly overall this quarter as we expected they are trending a bit better than our expectations when we started the year turning then to the accounting for this credit performance on slide as you know there a couple of key drivers of provision expense first actual credit performance which as we just discussed is extremely strong and second changes in credit reserves under the cecl methodology we built a small amount of reserves this quarter as our loan balances grew and the macroeconomic outlook that we flowed through our cecl models got slightly worse relative to the outlook back in q1 both partially offset by improved portfolio quality this reserve build combined with our low net writeoffs drove million of provision expense for the second quarter as you see on slide we ended the second quarter with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively this remains well below the reserve levels we had prepandemic going forward we continue to expect delinquency and loss rates to move up slowly over time but to remain well below prepandemic levels this year i do expect to end the year with a higher level of reserves on our balance sheet than where we ended this quarter given our expected loan growth but the overall range and timing of reserve adjustments will be heavily influenced by how the macroeconomic outlook evolves between now and the end of the year moving next to revenue on slide total revenues were up yearoveryear in the second quarter or on an fx adjusted basis as we continue to see a stronger us dollar relative to most of the major currencies in which we operate overall these results were above our original expectations american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 before i get into more details about our largest revenue drivers in the next few slides i would note that service fees and other revenue was up sharply growth yearoveryear largely driven by the uptick in travelrelated revenues that accelerated this quarter with crossborder spend in particular surpassing prepandemic levels our largest revenue line discount revenue grew yearoveryear in q2 on an fxadjusted basis as you can see on slide driven by both our sustained growth in goods and services spending and the accelerated te recovery that you saw in our spending trends net card fee revenues were up yearoveryear in the second quarter on an fxadjusted basis with growth continuing to accelerate as you can see on slide largely driven by the continued attractiveness to both prospects and existing customers of our feepaying products as a result of the investments weve made in our premium value propositions this quarter we acquired million new cards with acquisitions of us consumer platinum card members again reaching a record high and increasing above last quarters record level demonstrating the great demand were seeing especially for our premium feebased products moving on to net interest income on slide you can see that it was up yearoveryear on an fx adjusted basis accelerating above last quarters growth rate due to the continued recovery of our revolving loan balances looking forward while i would expect our loan balances to continue to recover at higher growth rates the rising rate environment will likely cause our net interest income growth rate to slow given our sizable noninterest bearing charge balances to sum up on revenues on slide were seeing continued strong results and sustained momentum across the board so looking forward we now expect to see revenue growth of to for the full year of so the revenue momentum we just discussed has been driven by the investments weve made in our brand value propositions customers colleagues technology and coverage and those investments show up across the expense lines you see on slide starting with variable customer engagement expenses these costs came in as expected at of total revenues for the quarter and are tracking with our expectation for variable customer engagement costs to run at around of total revenues on a fullyear basis on the marketing line we invested billion in the second quarter we feel really good about the strong demand for new card acquisitions as we showed on slide more importantly we feel good about the spend credit and revenue profiles of the customers we are bringing into american express membership which continue to look strong relative to what we saw prepandemic i would now expect to spend a little over billion on marketing in moving to the bottom of slide brings us to operating expenses which were billion in the second quarter theres often some quarterly volatility in this number due to the varied timing of certain accruals and entries this quarter for example we see the impact of the prior year including a sizable benefit from net mark to market gains in our amex ventures strategic investment portfolio as i said last quarter and as steve discussed earlier inflation while driving some modest positive impact on volumes is also putting pressure on our operating expenses particularly in our compensation costs taking everything into account we now expect our full year operating expenses to be around billion as we invest in our talented colleague base technology and other key underpinnings of our growth given our tremendously high levels of revenue growth american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 turning next to capital on slide we returned billion of capital to our shareholders in the second quarter including common stock repurchases of million and million in common stock dividends on the back of strong earnings generation our cet1 ratio was at the end of the second quarter within our target range of to we plan to continue to return to shareholders the excess capital we generate while supporting our balance sheet growth given the concerns about the macro economy in the market it is worth noting that in the feds ccar stress test results released last month american express was again one of the few firms that remained cumulatively profitable under the feds macroeconomic stress scenario and we had the highest profit margin as a percentage of assets of any participating bank that brings me to our growth plan and guidance on slide our performance yeartodate and our full year guidance reinforce several points that steve and i have now both discussed first and most importantly we clearly have momentum across all of the areas critical for us to drive sustained high levels of revenue growth including customer acquisition engagement and retention evidenced by our strong q2 results inflation is additionally providing some modest benefit to our revenues the combination of all these things led us to increase our expectations for full year revenue growth to to up from our original range of to for now though our eps guidance remains unchanged from between and let me walk you through our thinking there as i talked about earlier we feel really good about the strong results generated by our marketing investments this year and thats why we now expect to spend a little over billion for the full year modestly above our original expectations both steve and i also talked about the fact that there are some pressures on our operating expenses particularly around compensation and partially fueled by inflation and therefore we now expect our operating expenses to be around billion this year lastly and most importantly as we think about our eps this year as i talked about in the credit section while our credit performance and metrics remain extremely healthy we cant predict how the macroeconomic outlook will evolve that makes it difficult sitting here today to predict a precise range of outcomes for any potential cecl reserve adjustments for the balance of the year that said should the macroeconomic outlook not change meaningfully between now and the end of the year and therefore not have a large impact on credit reserves in the balance of the year we would expect to be at or even a bit above the high end of our eps guidance range in any environment we remain committed to executing against our growth plan and running the company with a focus on achieving our aspiration of delivering revenue growth in excess of and midteens eps growth on a sustainable basis in and beyond with that ill turn the call back over to kerri to open up the call for your questions kerri scheller bernstein head of investor relations american express co thanks jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation and with that the operator will now open the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from ryan nash of goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey ryan jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hey ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc maybe just to start on revenue growth steve so its obviously coming in much better than expected and youre choosing to invest more to propel future growth so i was just hoping maybe you could just talk a little bit about the additional investments that youre making across the company whether its in opex or in card member engagement how much of this is offensive to drive revenue growth versus defensive and then given the acceleration of investments that were seeing through could this position us for better revenue growth in the intermediate timeframe thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so i think everything that were doing here is offensive i mean you could argue that raising compensation is defensive but i think youve seen compensation being raised across so if i break out the categories youre going to see opex up and youre seeing opex up for two reasons number one we are investing a little bit more from an operating perspective but that investment the main investment from an operating expenses perspective is you cant grow your billings and with the majority of those billings being grown by by more transactions without having more people to be able to serve your customers to be able to engage with them from a travel perspective and you have to remember one of the huge differentiating factors that we have in our business model is our ability to serve our customers when and where they need to be served and as you get more and more transactions as you get more and more customers you do have a stepfunction increase and so a lot of our operating expense growth has been for the additional of people which is not maybe a popular topic right now that people are talking about but were adding people were not subtracting people from our business and were adding people to make sure that we can continue the level of service that we had and i dont mind doing that especially in a growth environment which is what were expecting look youre also seeing wage increase and you have to pay more to keep your best talent and so we will do that that is shortsighted not to do that and we will continue to do that american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 from a marketing perspective ive been doing this for a number of years now and one of the things that you hear us say is we have lots and lots of good investment opportunities and to let those investment opportunities go by the board because well we thought we mightve spent billion but maybe itll be billion whatever thats shortsighted because were running the company for the longer term so i would say that the investments that were making and additional investments in technology are truly all thinking about the long term here as far as revenue goes for next year look were building up momentum but i think when we came out and said we were going to grow to this year there was probably some skepticism and now were coming out and saying were going to grow to which is going to put the level of revenue at the end of this year obviously higher than what we thought we have a plan to get us to in at plus revenue growth on a sustainable basis which means in well certainly exceed what that number will actually be i dont know sitting here right now i dont know but i can tell you itll be on our growth trajectory and as long as we have good revenue opportunities and as long as we can continue to grow this business i will continue to invest and thats where we are and as jeff said we decided not to and i think its really important weve decided not to raise our eps guidance because of the uncertainty with cecl which quite honestly we dont have a lot of control over and so for us to sit here today and say hey look lets just raise it to then come back in the third quarter and the fourth quarter and say hey we had to drop it its foolhearted but the revenue is what weve seen and so when were asked questions about what you think about the economy and you see a slowdown if i was thinking there was a slowdown in the next couple of quarters i wouldnt be sitting here raising revenue to to so thats how i think about it operator thank you the next question is coming from sanjay sakhrani of kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning te was a big driver of the upside and i think jeff you mentioned theres been further strength in july which makes sense given were moving into the heart of the summer months are you guys concerned this is sort of a pull forward and you see a slowdown thereafter and maybe that ties into what we saw in corporate te because that also moved up quite a bit where do you think the new normal shakes out thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co all right thanks indiscernible stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so if you look at where we are right now and yes were at growth over and thats not really a big number when you think about it when you think about growth over from a te perspective and you think about sort of airline prices you think about some of the inflation built in id say theres more room to run on te and when you disaggregate sort of te and you look at it and you see that the consumer is running sort of above you got international consumer running only above and youve got sme running probably above and corporate travel is only of what it was in i wouldnt call that a pull forward american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 and then when i look at my bookings my future bookings in my consumer business theyre strong and then you start disaggregating you go below those numbers and you look and you say okay whats really driving it and you see a tremendous growth right were seeing a tremendous growth like growth in restaurant lodging is huge airline is way up but lodging and airline are still below levels in aggregate and the airline industry is probably only about of their capacity and they have some staffing issues and what have you and theyre sort of canceling so i dont think this is a pullforward at all i think theres a huge pentup demand obviously to get out and travel and see the world or see anybody at this particular point in time but no im not really concerned about a pullback because i dont think weve gotten to a normal level yet i really dont believe weve gotten to a normal level of te so now are we going to see yearoveryear growth rates no but i look at absolute aggregate numbers and i cant get too focused on just the growth rates were not at a normal level of te yet in our business operator thank you the next question is coming from betsy graseck of morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning yeah its really great great results here i wanted to dig in a little bit on how youre thinking about the loan growth on the sme side i know thats been accelerating here and just give us a sense as to where pockets of opportunity are and how you would flex if there was a slowdown thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co look our stated goal for sme business is to be the workingcapital provider for small businesses and so i think that what were trying to do is to be able to provide liquidity to them using cards weve got some shortterm workingcapital loans weve got some shorterterm term loans and theyre taking advantage of it but ill send you back to the pandemic i mean when you look at our small business base i think everybody was really concerned about how stressed this was or how stressed this could be because of what the perception is the makeup of small businesses and ive said this over and over again when people think about small businesses they think about restaurants they think about small retail on main street and its much more than that and so i think that and you saw how we performed i mean our credit metrics performed brilliantly through the pandemic and weve always grown in the last few years a little bit well prepandemic weve always grown faster than the market we have a very low share of our small businesses lending volume relative to their spending volume i mean we probably have over of their spending volume but of their spending level but we have less than maybe of the lend so there is opportunity and we will go after this opportunity the same way we go after everything else in a very measured analytical and riskadjusted way and so were not trying to grow crazily we are just providing our customers with what they need having said that i think youve seen our ability to pivot and if need be we will pivot again but what i do really love about our smallbusiness base not only that it continues to grow but it is so diverse across so many different types of industries and thats really really important operator thank you our next question is coming from bob napoli of william blair please go ahead american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc hi thank you good morning and also congratulate you on super strong numbers are really great to see i guess maybe a question on network coverage one of your key areas of focus and incremental investment and just maybe any update on how youre performing versus your plan on network expansion kind of obviously international seems like where you have the most opportunity from a network expansion any thoughts on or any metrics you can give on international and your thoughts on where your coverage should be internationally over the longterm stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah i mean look i mean from a us perspective we continue to remain at parity coverage and as we virtual parity coverage and as weve said it doesnt mean youre not going to run into somebody that doesnt accept the card now and again but usually when we do that were able to sign them up because its sort of old news in terms of what the rates are and how we and so forth so im not really i shouldnt say im not concerned about the us but i like where we are in the us and i like our approach to the us for international i think weve been really really clear weve been focusing on priority cities and continuing to drive those numbers higher and those continue to do well weve probably signed well over million merchants this year which is i think were on pace to sign as many as we did last year from an international perspective and well continue provide information not on a quarterly basis but on an asneeded basis to show you that the progress that were making but were really pleased with the progress that were making in our priority cities and that doesnt mean were not focused on signing every merchant that doesnt accept the card we do but we think its more important to sign those merchants where card members actually are and thats why the priority cities and the priority countries are so important for us and we feel really good about it and you only have to look at the international spending to say is it really working and when you look at sort of our international spending this year its up higher than our consumer spending year overyear for this quarter so its a big driver for growth for us operator thank you the next question is coming from mark devries of barclays please go ahead mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc thanks i had a question for steve about the growth in millennial and gen zs i assume its normal for the younger generations to have stronger growth just as a combination of what i assume are kind of stronger new account acquisitions and also just the ramping of spend as they age and their incomes grow can you give us a sense of what the breakdown is in that between new account acquisition and then actual organic spend on an individual account basis i know you indicated that they are spending more than previous newcomers but any sense of kind of dimensionalizing that how that compares and then just finally on comparing across the different cohorts kind of what your market share is for these newer cohorts compared to gen x and boomers at a couple points in their age stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 yeah so we dont really get into all of that either in our release or talk but let me give you a couple of points when we look at sort of how were getting card member spending we really look at share of wallet share of wallet is really important for us and from millennials and gen zs were getting a higher share of their wallet off the bat thats key because what happens is with a lot of our boomers and so forth especially our boomers they were used to an american express that was accepted in a limited universe our gen z and millennials are used to an american express thats really accepted everywhere and so were able to penetrate their wallets more right out of the gate because number one theyre more card savvy and they tend to use no cash and theyre more value proposition savvy and they tend to figure out how to utilize the card in the best way for them and so were getting a higher percentage of their wallet as they grow as their wallets grow as they progress through life our aim is to continue to keep that wallet share and thats a big deal plus as you acquire gen zs and millennials they tend to have a longer runway or tenure with the card product as far as the growth and breaking it out sort of i mean really what youre asking for is same store sales versus new store sales i dont really have that at the tip of my fingertips here jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah we dont disclose the exact numbers mark but we do pull it apart just like you described and we certainly have made the point that a disproportionate share of our new account acquisitions are going to that millennial and gen z demographic but then when you break out just to steves phrase the samestore sales it is also the fastest growing demographic on a same store sales basis so both contribute both the same store sales effect and the fact that they are disproportionate in our new customers operator thank you the next question is coming from dominick gabriele of oppenheimer please go ahead dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey great thank you so much obviously youre reporting incredibly strong recovery spending numbers if you just think about the spending cycle and inflation boosting nominal pce versus real pce how should we think about the effects on your highend consumer base versus the average us consumer in terms of their susceptibility to a spending slowdown and perhaps why could this customer base that you have act differently versus the average consumer in the next spending cycle im just talking about total spending if that works thanks so much stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co well i think the simple answer is they have more money but when you look at sort of whats going on in the economy and the stock market going up and down we have weve never really been tied to that i mean and ive been here forever right years or so and ive never seen a correlation between that what i have seen a correlation between is sort of unemployment and people losing their jobs and not being able to pay their bills and so thats potentially an issue down the road but were in a very crazy sort of environment and jeff called this out in his own remarks i mean weve got high inflation and low unemployment and its actually hard to hire people right now and so yes youre seeing some layoffs and some companies talking about slowing down their hiring and things like that but its not broadbased and its not broad scale at this particular point in time american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 and so i think as far as i look at this the cohort that we have which is a small segment of the us population but a very powerful segment of the us population you would have to see a huge credit crunch driven by unemployment i think for this covert to be hit the other thing i would say is when we pull apart our numbers the spending is not inflation driven and thats not to say theres not inflation in these numbers but you have to remember that coming out the end of last year when no one wanted to talk about it we had inflation in those numbers last year so whether you look at or sort of spending inflation out there in the environment its not an or benefit to our business because you do have a grow over but the most important thing for us is were seeing an increase in transactions and thats whats really driving our growth right now is an increase in overall transactions in our business and thats an important indicator for us we look at not only transactions but we look at transaction size and then we look at that transaction size a little bit on a normalized basis as you take the effects of inflation out and weve got real growth when you do that jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co yeah the only thing id add is that we have said consistently a modest level of inflation and i still use the word modest for where we are absent a spike in unemployment like steve said is generally net a positive thing for our business it helps revenues a little bit but puts a little pressure on cost but it nets to a positive and as long as the labor market stays where it is thats why we feel pretty good about the guidance weve given you for the rest of the year operator thank you the next question is coming from bill carcache of wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning steve and jeff stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi bill bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc could you speak to how much the competitive environment for high spending customers has intensified post pandemic particularly as other issuers look to compete beyond cash rewards to provide their customers with greater experiential value by investing in things like airline lounges travel portals and alike and then more specifically if i may just squeeze in on the acceleration in spending among large global corporates could you discuss which products are enjoying the greatest uplift there thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 yeah i mean this environment has been a highly competitive environment since the financial crisis and it hasnt really changed yeah i mean people invest in more things i mean weve all raised the price of ph pokey here a little bit but we figure our competitors will continue to invest we figure that our competitors will copy what were doing and thats why its important for us to stay ahead and so has it intensified we just work under the assumption its a highly competitive environment and will remain a highly competitive environment and youre really talking about the us consumer segment but youve got high competition in small business youve got high competition in various markets youve got high competition in corporate card but what we strive to do is put the best products and services out there and thats worked out pretty well for us and so yeah it requires a little bit more investment it requires investment across the board but in the long run i think you just have to look at the results and right now were acquiring more cards than weve ever acquired but weve said this before whats really important for us is that were looking to acquire revenues and were looking to acquire billed business we talk in terms of cards but those cards are generating new billed business and generating revenue for us obviously because were raising our revenue guidance as far as corporate im not sure i really understand the question all that much but we only have a corporate card and yeah companies are spending but were only at our te is only at and jeff where are we overall on corporate card spending i dont know jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co its a little higher because the travel never went down as much so the overall number is at about closer to prepandemic stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so but were not back yet but youre seeing pockets of it and consultants are back out there on the road and bankers are back out there on the road and i think people are having a lot more meetings i know we had one in june and it was hard to get conference room space for like people and even looking to book for next year for the same type of meeting boy people are out there booking a year yearandahalf in advance and i think thats good for the lodging business its good for the airline business and its good for us so thats kind of where it is operator thank you the next question is coming from lisa ellis of moffettnathanson please go ahead lisa d ellis q analyst moffettnathanson llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question steve and jeff you commented earlier on some of the near term investments that youre making given the strong growth in top line youre seeing in wages and marketing et cetera can you also comment a bit perhaps on some of the longerterm investments that youre leaning in on kind of taking advantage of the strong growth in the business to be able to lean in and position amex even better for the next sort of three to five years thank you american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah well i mean were always making theres always a balance between longterm investments and short term investments and we dont talk a lot about the longterm investments till they actually happen but you have to invest in your technology and weve done that and ive talked about that before because weve been one of the only companies that have said were not taking stepfunction changes in our technology investment because weve been investing in technology all along were constantly investing in value proposition and when people look at that and we sit here on the phone here and we talk about it its like okay so what are you going to do to the platinum card well its not the platinum card its the proprietary countries that we operate in and the smallbusiness cards that we operate in those countries and the corporate cards we operate in those countries and the cobrand cards we operate in those countries and the personal cards green gold platinum and centurion so were constantly investing and i think we used the platinum card in the us either business or personal as a proxy for our overall investment and thats not it because were investing in all our card products across the globe on an ongoing basis you cant have product refreshes by just snapping your fingers and saying hey were going to have a product refresh this is months and months and months in the making and negotiations and partnerships and so forth but look we continue to invest in our lounge program we continue to look at those things that add more value i mean youve seen the expansion of things that weve done whether its checking accounts and debit cards for our consumers and our small businesses and what were trying to do is to create more stickiness and more reason to interact with american express on an ongoing basis i mean just look at sort of how the services around our card products have evolved over the last few years whether that be from a small business perspective where we can meet a wide variety of your working capital needs banking needs and so forth and then look at from a consumer perspective and look at what weve done with resy with over million registered users on resy and we have cards on file a huge acquisition so well continue to make those longerterm investments but youll continue to hear about them as they happen operator thank you the next question is coming from moshe orenbuch of credit suisse please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks and steve we certainly note your comments that youre not anticipating a recession in the next couple of quarters given what youre seeing in your customer base but could you just talk conceptually about how you think about account acquisition in terms of kind of new accounts a high level of new accounts obviously the industry as a whole is still doing that but clearly lessseasoned accounts are the ones that always would carry somewhat more risk and maybe talk about things you do to kind of mitigate that or steps you would take if you saw that unemployment rate start to rise thanks jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well let me maybe start moshe by just reminding everyone of the highly analytical process we have for determining who we bring in to membership in the franchise and its based on searching for that premium customer whether theyre a consumer or a small businesses its based on the vast amounts of data and history we have and its based on having very high financial cutoffs for who we allow into the franchise or not american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 and when you look at the outcome of that process right now we are on average bringing in new customers who have higher credit qualities than we saw prepandemic in who are showing much higher spending profiles and who are also carrying balances at a greater rate so we feel really good about the people were bringing in into the franchise and as youve heard steve and i and doug and others talk about we also always when we bring people in model their results assuming there will be a recession i dont know when therell be a recession but there will be and so we build a throughthecycle view of the economics right into our upfront calculation of whether we think its a good idea or not to bring a given customer into the franchise at a given level of marketing spend stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co and the other thing id say is that changes that can change daily that can change weekly those criteria could change monthly it all depends on how were looking at and what our models are showing and what were feeling the other reality is that we could lower our thresholds spend even a lot more money but theres that balance that you have and that balance of making sure that were growing the bottom line in an appropriate fashion and also making sure that we have a higher quality consumer and small business as part of our franchise but it is something that has been developed over many many years and its not static i mean i think thats the key point this thing is not static and we continue to adjust it and modify it jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co you know steve the other thing i would add and im going to quote you is we run the company for the long term we make these decisions on a throughthecycle basis there will be a recession at some point dont know when but the thing about recessions is theyre always followed by a recovery and were running the company to achieve the highest possible sustainable level of longterm growth and we think that the process we have and the analytics we have for bringing people into the franchise are very consistent with that operator thank you the next question is coming from chris donat of piper sandler please go ahead christopher donat q analyst piper sandler co good morning thanks for taking my question i wanted to dig try to dig a little deeper on the travel and entertainment recovery in the slide you had and revisit the question about possible pull forward i heard the commentary around bookings and so that seems good for visibility for airlines and lodging what im wondering about is should there be any reason to be concerned around restaurant spending which has been really strong and is restaurant spending highly correlated with lodging and airlines maybe we dont need to worry about it or just if youre seeing anything that could be a cause for concern and maybe a future pullback in restaurants stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co the only thing i would say is that if restaurant spending is really highly correlated with lodging and airlines you are going to expect it to go up but i think look anybody who has been to a restaurant prices are a little bit higher because theyve got wages and theyve got food cost and so forth but you know look from my perspective restaurants really sort of a lot of them change their business models during the pandemic because restaurants that werent doing take out do take out and so people are eating out a lot more and theyre spending more time at restaurants and ordering from restaurants so no i really dont think its highly correlated at all american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 and in fact if you took restaurant out and we just said travel and travel being defined as car rental lodging and air were not back yet right whats pulling te over the finish line here to go past that is truly restaurants so if anything as people travel more you might see more restaurant spending or the other side of that is you wont see more restaurant spending because now theyll eat in a different location i dont think a pullback here will really hurt restaurants all that much operator thank you the next question is coming from rick shane of jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan thanks guys for taking my question when i think about the numbers two things stand out one is the loan growth and the other is obviously the strong penetration for millennial and gen z card growth i am curious if as millennials and gen z customers are taking cards if those are being delivered with additional features enabled on borrow or are there behavioral factors that are causing your younger demographic to borrow more jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well maybe ill start steve so first we have moved over the last couple of years rick to add to the majority of our charge products a pay overtime capability for existing card members that phases in in a variety of ways for new card members that capability is on as it is as they get the card so i do think that has some impact on our results there also is a demographic feature as i talked about earlier if you look at who were bringing into the franchise now and there is a skew towards the millennials and gen zs they are higher spending higher credit quality and there is a propensity to carry balances that is a little higher than what we see in the older demographic stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah and they also tend to use our pay it plan it feature a little bit more which is and ill use these words buy now pay later but on the backend as opposed to a pointofsale i mean they can go on to their statement and decide look for this particular charge im going to pay it in six installments and im going to pay it at a month im going to pay the rest of my balance in full so i think that capability of looking at your statement deciding which things you might want to pay in installments deciding which things you might want to use pay with points to pay deciding which things you might want to revolve and then deciding which things you want to pay in full is a pretty good feature of the product and so when you look at meeting somebodys entire payment needs boy that kind of does it in a onestop shopping operator thank you the next question is coming from mihir bhatia of bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america good morning and thank you for taking my questions jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co hi mihir american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 mihir bhatia q analyst bank of america hi i wanted to ask a little bit about just longer term right i appreciate your comments about making investments now while the opportunity is available but i was wondering just your longerterm for example in youve guided to higher than longerterm revenue growth in so will that also translate into higher than longterm eps growth or higher than longterm ppnr growth or is there just so much white space available for you just the amount of growth opportunity that could also be another big investment year just trying to understand how you balance that all those revenue upside you see versus the investment opportunities available to you jeffrey c campbell a vice chairman chief financial officer american express co well i cant resist mihir starting by pointing out that yes steve and i talked a lot about the heavy investments that were making this year were also growing our pretax preprovision profit by this quarter in line with the revenue growth look as steve said earlier well have to see i think we feel really good about the revenue momentum we have and so just mathematically given our longterm sustainable goals in a steadystate environment for and beyond i expect to be above that easily above the level on revenue growth next year how much dont know well have to see and that provides a pretty darn good platform for good earnings growth all that said its only july we havent given you guys specific guidance for next year and the wild card from a gaap eps perspective in all this is the volatility that youve seen so much of in the last ten quarters in the cecl credit reserves because we have good i think visibility and beliefs about the trajectory of our own business but the consensus macroeconomic forecast and how it evolves is going to have a big influence on what we put for credit reserves stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co but just think about those two numbers that jeff threw out revenue growth and ppnr growth would you have felt better if it was and we decided not to invest i mean i wouldnt i think whats really important and ill take you back to investor day this is a flywheel scale is important scale begets more scale and not crazy scale but scale with premium card members from a smallbusiness perspective and a consumer perspective that merchants want to see and merchants want to provide value to which continues that strength of the flywheel and thats one thing as you know weve talked about that you see more competition the one thing that is really really hard to replicate and we havent used these words but this enclosed cycle that we have otherwise known as the famous closed loop the ability to have those merchants and have those card members and to be able to feed off one another from a value perspective is really really critical and the value that were able to provide merchants with highspending card members and the value that those merchants are able to provide to our card members is really really important and so as we sit here and look at our business and look at it longterm whats really important is that growth and that sustainable growth and again throw all the noise out around cecl and credit reserve releases and bills and so forth and if you focus on that number boy and is pretty good and so we feel really good about the level of investment that weve made in the business and quite honestly dont necessarily focus on any of those american express co axp corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2022 individual line items but focus on the aggregate in what its driving and the value its creating and if youre just going to measure value through a quarterly eps growth youre missing the point what you need to measure value is on how sustainable your business model is over the long term and all were doing is enhancing our business model over the longterm with these investments operator thank you our final question will come from don fandetti of wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning can you provide an update on b2b progress are you seeing small businesses accelerate their automation of accounts payable and also large corporates on the supplier side are they accepting more cards stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co the short answer is yes were not sharing all the statistics but small businesses continue when you look at our smallbusiness base probably over of their spending is b2b spending versus te spending and we continue to see acompay go up for us our partnerships continue to yield more value were seeing and jeff talked about it were at about of where we were from a corporate card perspective but yet only from a travel perspective so thats driven by more b2b but its not when you look at that automation of b2b some of it is automation of existing business especially in the small businesses some of it is growth but it still continues to be a longterm play but youre seeing more suppliers take it and well continue to work towards getting more acceptance and leveraging our flexible model here to be able to work with suppliers and our small businesses and our corporations to drive more acceptance and to drive more spend kerri scheller bernstein head of investor relations american express co great with that we will bring the call to
