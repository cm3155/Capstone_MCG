approach to both our colleagues and customers continues to be grounded in our purpose and served us well in the second quarter our colleagues again demonstrated that we make peoples lives better help businesses thrive and strengthen the communities we serve now on to slide these are the key messages we want to highlight today first huntington has a distinguished deposit franchise which continues to benefit from our strategy to acquire and deepen primary bank customer relationships this has fueled continued deposit growth over the year including this quarter second we once again drove capital ratios higher with common equity tier having increased for four quarters in a row we remain on track to build cet1 to the high end of our range by yearend third credit quality which is a hallmark of the company is performing very well and we continue to operate within our aggregate moderate to low risk appetite fourth we are dynamically managing through the interest rate environment we are maintaining disciplined deposit pricing while delivering deposit growth and maintaining a robust liquidity position finally we remain intently focused on executing our strategy we are investing in the business to drive longterm sustainable revenue growth and we continue to proactively manage the expense base to align with the revenue outlook operation accelerate remains on track and we will increase our use of business process outsourcing to drive sustained efficiencies into moving on to slide over the past decade weve transformed huntington this puts us in a position of strength today this foundation includes our granular and high quality deposit base which is supported by our leading consumer business and commercial banking franchises with this strong foundation in place we can be nimble and seize on opportunities to expand our business that will arise during times like these the hiring of the fund finance team we announced last month is a great example this business was on our commercial banking growth roadmap and were pleased to be able to add great talent and welcome these colleagues to huntington we are building capital even as we maintain loan growth we are optimizing the level of new loan growth and remaining judicious for the loans we carry on balance sheet in order to generate the highest return on capital as a result capital ratios expanded in the second quarter with our cet1 ratio increasing to further our adjusted cet1 ratio is above the peer median our disciplined approach to risk management drives our strong credit quality with low net chargeoffs and the nonperforming asset ratio decreasing for the eighth consecutive quarter our management team has a long track record of being disciplined operators with the focus on delivering value for shareholders this execution has been awarded and recognized across the franchise including winning the jd power mobile award for the fifth year in a row and maintaining our strong number one sba ranking huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 regarding the macro outlook it remains a dynamic environment interest rates are playing out in the higher for longer scenario that we had been anticipating for some time economic activity in our footprint appears to be holding up relatively well which supports sustained loan growth and solid credit performance that said we are diligent watching the environment closely and are actively managing our loan portfolio we are wellprepared to operate through a range of potential scenarios further we are also closely monitoring the potential regulatory adjustments to capital and other requirements we are evaluating the proposals and thus far the potential new requirements appear broadly in line with what we had expected we are wellpositioned to manage through these changes address them expediently and over time offset a meaningful portion of the potential impacts and finally before i hand it over to zach we want to share that rich pohle our chief credit officer has announced his upcoming retirement effective at the end of weve greatly benefited from richs expertise and leadership during his nearly years with huntington hes been a great leader of our colleagues and a great partner for me and the executive team we have a strong bench and were pleased brendan lawlor deputy chief credit officer will succeed rich in this role at the end of the year brendan joined us in after 25plus years as a senior commercial credit executive at a large regional bank and is currently responsible for all commercial credit across the bank zach over to you to provide more detail on our financial performance zachary j wasserman chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks steve and good morning everyone slide provides highlights of our second quarter results we reported gaap earnings per common share of return on tangible common equity or rotce came in at for the quarter further adjusting for aoci rotce was deposits grew during the quarter increasing by billion or on an endofperiod basis loan balances continued to grow as total loans increased by million or from the prior quarter credit quality remained strong with the net chargeoffs of basis points and allowance for credit losses of as steve mentioned capital increased from the prior quarter this solid capital position coupled with our robust credit reserves puts our cet1 plus acl loss absorbing capacity in the top quartile of the peer group turning to slide average loan balances increased quarteroverquarter or annualized driven by commercial loans which increased by million or from the prior quarter primary components of this commercial growth included distribution finance which increased million asset finance increased by million business banking increased by million auto floor plan increased by million offsetting this growth cre balances were lower by million in consumer growth continued to be led by residential mortgage which increased by million and rvmarine which increased by million partially offsetting this growth were lower auto loan balances which declined by million turning to slide as noted we continued to deliver ending deposit growth in the second quarter balances were higher by billion primarily driven by consumer with commercial balances up modestly on a yearoveryear basis ending deposits increased by billion or huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 turning to slide we saw sustained growth in deposit balances throughout the second quarter on a monthly basis total deposit average balances expanded sequentially for april may and june with june ending balances above the june monthly average providing a strong start point as we enter q3 within consumer deposits we have now seen average balances increase for seven months in a row within commercial average monthly deposits were stable over the course of the second quarter turning to slide i want to share more details on our noninterest bearing deposits overall the billion of these deposits represent of total balances and are welldiversified across consumer business and commercial banking the ongoing mix shift we have seen from noninterest bearing over the past two quarters has been in line with our expectations and consistent with what we saw in the last cycle we expect this mix shift trend to moderate and then stabilize in this trend is reflected in our total deposit beta guidance on to slide for the quarter net interest income decreased by million or to billion driven by lower sequential net interest margin on a yearoveryear basis nii increased million or we continue to benefit significantly from our asset sensitivity and the expansion of margins that has occurred throughout the cycle reconciling the change in nim from the prior quarter we saw a reduction of basis points on both a gaap and core basis excluding accretion during q2 we maintained an elevated cash balance relative to q1 which impacted nim even as it had a relatively minor actual cash economic cost on a comparative basis normalizing for cash levels nim was for the quarter or a 21basispoint decline from the prior quarter the biggest drivers of the lower nim quarteroverquarter were higher funding costs partially offset by increased earning asset yields we continue to analyze multiple potential interest rate scenarios as we forecast expected trends over the remainder of and into the two primary scenarios we incorporate include one which is represented by the forward yield curve and another which assumes rates stay higher for longer and end approximately basis points higher than the forward we think this is the most likely range for shortterm rates over the next six quarters based on this range we anticipate net interest margin of approximately by q4 plus or minus a few basis points this would equate to core net interest income on a dollar basis for the fourth quarter to be down approximately to from q2 levels as we look out further into clearly the trends will depend on both those interest rate scenarios and what is happening with the broader economy and industry factors including loan demand and deposit growth that said our modeling indicates nim outlooks are stable to rising during which coupled with earning asset growth is expected to drive net interest income dollar expansion as we move through turning to slide cost of deposits moved higher in the quarter to our cumulative beta through q2 is up percentage points from the prior quarter in line with our expectations and prior guidance as i mentioned we continue to expect cumulative deposit beta of approximately huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 turning to slide on the securities portfolio we saw another step up in reported yields quarteroverquarter we did not reinvest cash flows from securities in the second quarter as we allowed those proceeds to remain in cash given the attractive shortterm rates cash and securities balances on average increased by billion from the prior quarter as we maintained higher cash levels in the quarter as of june on an ending basis cash and securities totaled billion representing a more normalized level as we go forward into q3 turning to slide our contingent liquidity continues to be robust our two primary sources of liquidity cash and borrowing capacity at the fhlb and federal reserve represented billion and billion respectively at the end of q2 at quarter end this pool of available liquidity represented of total uninsured deposits a peer leading coverage turning to slide our hedging program is dynamic continually optimized and welldiversified our objectives are to protect capital and operate scenarios and protect nim in down rate scenarios during the quarter we further expanded our pay fixed swaptions hedge position to protect capital from tail risk in substantive uprate scenarios there was a modest upfront premium associated with these swaptions and the hedges result in a marktomarket each quarter as theyre deemed economic hedges on the subsequent slide you will see that positive impact during the second quarter on our fee revenues we also remain focused on our objective of managing nim to protect the downside and have maintained additional upside nim opportunity given our asset sensitivity the interest rate movements in the first few weeks of q3 have provided opportunities for additional attractive hedging we have incrementally added modest additional exposures to both our capital protection and nim protection hedge portfolios and well remain dynamic as we go throughout the quarter if further opportunities arise moving on to slide noninterest income was million for the second quarter excluding notable items fees increased million including a million benefit from the positive marktomarket on the pay fixed swaptions excluding this benefit underlying fee income would have been million we saw solid performance in our key areas of strategic focus including payments and wealth management capital markets revenues declined by million from the prior quarter however increased by million yearoveryear clearly the events of march and the us debt ceiling debate caused a fairly challenging capital markets environment in q2 however pipelines remain solid and there are encouraging signs pointing to opportunity in the back half of the year moving on to slide gaap noninterest expense decreased by million adjusted for notable items in the prior quarter core expenses increased by million driven by a full quarter effect of annual merit increases and higher marketing spend we entered the year with a posture of managing core expense growth to a very low level given the economic backdrop we developed and executed a series of proactive actions to reduce expense run rates including the voluntary retirement program organizational alignment and our continued implementation of longterm efficiency programs such as branch optimization and operation accelerate huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 we continually calibrate the level of expense growth to revenues and were taking additional actions to further manage the pace of expense growth even as we remain focused on selffunding investments in our key growth initiatives were actively working on the next set of mediumterm efficiency opportunities including business process outsourcing which represents a promising lever for us to continue to deliver a low level expense growth into slide recaps our capital position common equity tier increased to and has increased sequentially for four quarters oci impacts to common equity tier resulted in an adjusted cet1 ratio of our tangible common equity ratio or tce increased basis points to q2 ending cash levels were higher than q1end which impacted the tce ratio by basis points adjusting for aoci our tce ratio was our capital management strategy will result in expanding capital over the course of the year while maintaining our top priority to fund high return loan growth we intend to grow cet1 to the very high end of our target operating range of to adjusting for aoci we expect adjusted cet1 to be in the approximately mid range by yearend on slide credit quality continues to perform very well as mentioned net chargeoffs were basis points for the quarter this was lower than last quarter by basis points on a yearoveryear basis chargeoffs were up basis points from the prior years historic low level nonperforming assets declined from the previous quarter and have reduced for eight consecutive quarters allowance for credit losses is higher by basis points to of total loans on slide we continue to be below our target range of net chargeoffs through the cycle of to basis points and our acl coverage ratio is among the highest in our peer group lets turn to our outlook on slide as i noted we analyze multiple potential scenarios to project financial performance and develop management action plans our guidance is informed by the interest rate scenarios i discussed previously and the consensus economic outlook on loans our outlook is to consistent with our prior expectations to be near the lower end of our prior range on deposits we maintain our outlook of to growth for the full year core net interest income ex paa and ppp is expected to grow between and inclusive of our expectations for deposit beta and loan growth noninterest income on a core full year basis is expected to be down to this range reflects the results from capital markets weve already seen in q2 and the assumption of gradual improvement in activities throughout the balance of the year the remainder of our fee businesses are tracking very well to our prior expectations on expenses as noted we are proactively managing with a posture to keep underlying core expense growth at a very low level and calibrated to revenue growth for the full year we expect core underlying expense growth between and plus the incremental expenses from the full year run rate of capstone and torana of approximately million and the 2basispoint increase in fdic insurance rates of approximately million huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 and finally given the strong results posted during the first half of the year we now expect full year net chargeoffs to be between to basis points with that we will conclude our prepared remarks and move to qa tim over to you timothy r sedabres executive vice presidentfinance headinvestor relations huntington bancshares inc thanks zach operator we will now take questions we ask that as a courtesy to your peers each person ask only one question and one related followup and then if that person has additional questions he or she can add themselves back into the queue thank you question and answer section operator thank you at this time well be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please proceed with your question manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning manan zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc i wanted to dig into your comments on nim being stable to rising in under the two scenarios that you outlined for rates can you expand on some of the moving parts in there especially in the higher for longer scenario i guess would that that put more pressure on nii than the forward curve scenario with higher deposit betas or do i have that wrong zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hey manan this is zach ill take that one and thanks for the question i think the outlook that were seeing is really consistent with both of those scenarios i think in the higher for longer scenario thats sort of the top end of that scenario range we would benefit from our asset sensitivity asset yields would continue to rise likely there would be a continuation of kind of an extending out of the liability pricing cycle but the net of those two things we continue to expect actually to be higher overall nim given the asset sensitivity and very consistent with what weve discussed over time huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 at the lower end of the scenario you can see the kind of the faster indiscernible of the deposit pricing cycle but also some less increase in asset pricing and likewise indiscernible for the nim but albeit maybe a few basis points lower than that so generally higher rates for us to continue to corroborate the higher nim i would note as well that during the course of we will benefit from the shifting from a negative carry on our down rate pension program to a much more neutral position by the end of the year so that will give us support for nim trajectory throughout the course of manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and then separately just on regulation overall i know you noted that the requirement seem to be broadly coming in inline with expectations but maybe if you can dig into how youre managing ahead of that i know youre keeping your building capital levels from here or youre holding a higher level of cash and sort of reinvesting in securities so maybe can you expand on where you expect regulation to go especially as it relates to the aoci opt out as well as lcr zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc sure as you noted we are trying to be planful anticipatory of where we think things are going and manage ahead of it and i think at the most macro level we do think well be able to relatively expediently draft these potential new regulations and frankly over time offset a lot of those otherwise be potential impacts on nim but digging in specifically its our working assumption that the tailoring exclusion of aoci indiscernible cet1 will likely be removed and hence its our plan to continue to manage capital higher to move cet1 inclusive of aoci higher in the guidance we indicated in the mid range by the end of and if we continue on with the same operating posture into we would expect that ratio to approach so it should get to by the end of so back to essentially the low end of our operating range on that basis were also actively looking at the basel iii potential new rwa changes as you know well there are three big changes in their fundamental review of the trading book indiscernible material for huntington given our business mix theres operational risk requirements which likely will be increasing rwa indiscernible fee income we see a slightly higher rwa from that however offsetting that will be credit risk rwas which are more nuanced more finetuned and on net are lower we believe for huntington still early days and more analysis to go but we see offsetting factors there unclear whether therell be a net impact from that but generally relatively offsetting as it relates to other regulatory focuses like liquidity like potential longterm debt likewise were monitoring and we think we can those effects will be relatively small over time happy to doubleclick on that in any further questions indiscernible manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank please proceed with your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc hi matt matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc indiscernible from some of your peers is a pullback in lending as they look to build capital and alleviate of the funding pressures on the flip side obviously youve got very strong capital strong liquidity as you highlighted high reserves and just wondering how youre thinking about how you can play offense and maybe take advantage of the pullback side of some of your peers zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thats a great question matt and its something that we really actively look at because we are in a position of strength we want to really seize the opportunities to win new clients win great business so its in times like this that the companies when they operate in a position of strength really can be meaningful including market share and were cognizant of that were balancing that clearly with two factors one the desire to not only grow loans but to also drive capital higher as i just noted in the prior question so were actively modulating loan growth bring it down to the run rate yearoveryear level to q1 in q2 we think will be more like probably in the back half of the year were also very much looking at how we could potentially optimize the balance sheet and drive high returns out of the assets we do have with that being said we are in our front foot you saw us indiscernible team which would be a great new business line for us brings liquidity great customer quality there and we are continuing to look finding pockets of strong growth even as we optimize for the highest returns indiscernible margin so very much on the front foot and to your point there are in fact opportunity well see them through matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then i guess just following up on the lending side i mean everything we can track it seems like auto spreads are at or near highs mortgage spreads are highs commercial spreads have widened so why isnt there a leaning into this or is it just that the demand is not there at this point huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no look so i think there continues to be pockets of demand and great clients and weve got a very strong set of clients that were supporting as well and to your point the yields are strong with that being said clearly deposit costs are also rising and funding costs are also rising so were balancing those things in a way we think is prudent driving higher yields i would say really feel encouraged by what were seeing on the asset yield side the long duration asset categories like mortgage and auto really benefiting between and bps on the portfolio and i would expect that to continue for some time to come sustaining that and beyond nim that we were talking about in the previous question even as theyre going to be optimized to also allot capital to us stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc matt this is steve i think its fair to say were being a little cautious until we know the outcome of the regulatory suggested reforms as well theres more opportunity i think that we will avail ourselves once we know what the rules are and the positions that we need to have going forward matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah fair enough thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please proceed with your question steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everyone stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc morning steven zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc so zach the commentary you gave about the nim getting down to about by the fourth quarter is helpful id imagine once we move beyond that because it sounds like most of the mix shift out of noninterest bearing will be huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 done its really going to be that incremental nim thats going to decide where we go from there what is the spot nim today right is it incremental loans incremental deposits just how does that compare to that level zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc still higher than that i think i pointed you for the quarter adjusted for cash levels that were kind of running at now in the third quarter the second quarter was around and so what were seeing at the margin is continued modest decline in nim here through the course of the balance of this year from that normalized q2 run rate down to the by the end of the year and i agree with your point which is as you get into the early part of next year a lot of the kind of major trends start to stabilize and its really about kind of incremental fundamental what the underlying nim is likely therell be some potential continued trend at the very early part of but i agree with your point i would also note that indiscernible the reduction indiscernible some hedges will incrementally help throughout the course of the year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah right just some tailwinds there okay and then for steve so the equity market seems to be coming around to this possibility of a soft landing im curious when you talk to your customers what are you hearing are they coming around to this soft landing and maybe a little more optimistic what are you hearing thanks stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc steve i would say our customers generally are having a good year and expect to close out with a good year theyre working their margins through expenses but inflation seems to be abating supply chain is in better shape clearer line of sight to this half and theyre optimistic about and beyond generally so this would suggest at worst a soft landing and potentially the ability to avoid a recession in the midwest particularly our footprint theres still a lot of economic activity announcements of investments targeted growth so were in a really good position relative to some other regions and we have significant activity going on that i think well see particularly here in ohio through the course of this year steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thanks for all the color stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please proceed with your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just wanted to go spend some time on the expense outlook i think youve done a lot of work here today the project accelerate sic operation accelerate that you talked about and zach i think you said the goal is to keep expense growth low for next year maybe give us a sense of the size of that bpo opportunity that you talked about and how do you think about positive operating leverage going into next year given nii growth will likely be tough thoughts around that zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah great great question ebrahim thanks indiscernible but maybe framing the overall posture it is very much to keep operating expenses at a very low level not only this year but next year weve been trying to be very proactive in setting up those programs so we can implement them effectively and have them build over time on the bpo opportunity it is something that we have leveraged over time for a while and continually will be looking at from a strategic perspective what functions that we really believe must be owned or which critical value for them to be owned by huntington versus those that we can benefit from the scale and capabilities of partner and i think that the more we lean into analyze that from the more were encouraged there are incremental opportunities relatively modest in terms of size this year but building over time and i think really part of the portfolio of efficiency programs that will support that low level into and frankly continue to build into and beyond also so its encouraging indiscernible to be able to accelerate the benefits of on positive operating leverage weve said a lot its a core tenet of our operating plan its one of the three major financial targets weve set for ourselves its something we take very seriously of course were managing the company for the medium term to really generate value and want to make sure that were not doing anything in the short term that would damage that longterm growth trajectory too early to say what will look like i think well clearly have a grow over on revenue that will pressure revenue growth but were also very encouraged as i said with the opportunity to keep expense growth low so im not going to give guidance at this moment still think its within the range of indiscernible for that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc ebrahim if i could add this is steve the team is also working on a longerterm project called operation accelerate we shared that at the investor day its changing procedures and digitizing substantially the front to back side of the bank that is going very well its on track and its multiyear and that will help us with both efficiencies and customer sat so we zach got his focus on consolidating branches we did a voluntary retirement program weve done some restructuring of segments and some of the business units and support units during the course of the year well indiscernible now with bpo is additive to a very healthy level of focus and activity on the expense management side so far this year ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc understood and any updated thoughts steve you talked about building capital but at the same time youve talked about fee revenue opportunities doing some targeted ma like youve done in the past any thoughts there is the opportunity set attractive for you to do anything stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc well our focus as you know is always to grow the core business weve got a lot of opportunity to do that in front of us and as the regulatory expectations around capital and liquidity et cetera get established i think were going to be in a very strong position to lean into that and in an even more robust fashion were trying to get positioned for that now beyond that as you saw last year there are key businesses that were attracted i suspect well find some additional ones at some point in the future but we believe weve got a lot of opportunity at hand and theres nothing pressing in terms of pushing or needing to push for ma now and so were very very focused on driving the core ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc indiscernible operator thank you our next question comes from line of scott siefers with piper sandler please proceed with your question r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning everyone thanks for taking the questions huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc hey scott r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co hey steve or zach just im trying to conceptually maybe when you think about that cum beta maybe just a thought or two on the major puts and takes when you think about that being the right number for you all year you guys are in very competitive market but i think its clear within like the last month or so especially that the deposit flows are there so i guess im just curious what youre seeing in terms of competitive dynamic and what sort of make that the right number to land on it so zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah this is zach scott ill take that one all of the trends and forecasts that were creating and as i noted in the prepared remarks where pretty rigorous multiple scenarios underlying that continue to corroborate that so we feel like its a good forecast as always i always note the best forecast weve got well share and update one if ever that comes to pass but our forecasts have been pretty stable around that level for a while now and those kind of underlying monthly trends continue to corroborate it just doubleclicking in terms of the drivers i would say one were seeing a continued modest rise in deposit costs but at a decelerating rate just like you would expect it to be besides beta trends like in q1 in q2 it will be less than that beyond q3 clearly and then kind of topping out into q4 so thats one just sort of seeing declining trend albeit increasing the other thing is the mix shift from noninterestbearing into interestbearing is occurring indiscernible like we would expect it to in cycle and that likewise is decelerating most of that mix shift has happened at this point and were already beginning to see the signs of that thats again built up and corroborated to that on the competition side its a competitive environment but to your point the deposits are there and i think whats encouraging is its very rational and i think that given a decelerating loan growth throughout the industry and for us thats the kind of escape valve pressure which is allowing us to manage it pretty well here according to our plan so overall just hoping thats the right forecast r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect and thats all i have sir thank you very much zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks scott operator thank you our next question comes from the line of erika najarian with ubs please proceed with your question huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning erika erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question zach is a clarification one your cumulative beta thats on total deposits correct zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thats correct erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thats because a lot of your peers give it on interestbearing so i just wanted to make sure that just thought of that when scott was asking a question and my real question is i think the market really appreciate sort of the expansion of the net interest income outlook could you tell us about how youre thinking about the elasticity of deposit pricing on the way down i think you pointed earlier that there are a lot of investors that are thinking about rate cuts for next year and theyre wondering how much power do banks have to price down if rates stay at a relatively high level versus what weve seen in a while zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah terrific questions also its a topic that gets lots of mind share with us just as rigorously as weve demonstrated on the way up indiscernible just as rigorous on the way down so very much playing and watching that i think it will clearly be a function of what segments youre in what segment youre looking at on the commercial side where betas are generally higher indiscernible priority agreements between us and our clients around how well trend that will likewise trend low indiscernible will drive that at very similar measure to the way it went up i think many of the other very rationally priced segments like that in the middle market and business banking will likewise trend down pretty fast as rates decline in some of the categories which well be drawing in consumer there are some time dimensions to them which well have to manage at those times it lasts but again the playbook there is welltrodden and i think we feel quite good about the ability to bring that down the overall indiscernible consumer side is clearly the function of whats going on in the economy at that point and the outlook indiscernible forward at that point but again all the playbooks in history would corroborate indiscernible to do that pretty well huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and just as a followup to that if i may youre holding a lot of cash and obviously youre theres not a lot of motivation to deploy that again as we think about next year in the same scenario youre still going to be earning a lot of your cash on your cash flow risk weight if the fed cuts moderately and i guess outside of better loan growth zach what would be the factors for you to normalize start normalizing that cash to a level thats more appropriate or do you feel like with all the liquidity goals down the pipe you might as well just hold it there for now since youre getting paid for it anyway zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah so i think that the level that were running at for cash right now is at around billion to billion is the right level for the company given liquidity requirements so i think were generally at where we think is the right level always tuning at the margin for how were incrementally funding and kind of tuning the shortterm fhlb borrowing cash level but i think for the most part that cash level is rightsized right now i think within the securities portfolio broadly well continue to see the trend of moderately lower duration sequentially as weve been doing for the last three quarters indiscernible and just continuing to preference liquidity erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please proceed with your question ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey thanks good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc zach just a followup on your nii comments and you talked about earning asset growth im just wondering your balance sheet has been elevated this quarter a good amount and i guess are you expecting as you look out further that deposit growth will continue to carry the overall balance sheet side forward and kind of i guess how do you think about the wholesale funding part of the equation as a balancing act in that huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah terrific question and broadly speaking the answer is yes so i believe that we will bring loan growth in line with deposit growth for the most parts and i think thats what well see here in the back half of this year thats my expectation for the trend into as well i kind of see a pretty stable if not slightly lower loan to deposit ratio here over the next couple quarters and just fundamentally match funding making sure that we can its one of those fundamental underlying factors that allows us to manage the deposit beta and the marginal margin that were getting on the loans as i noted earlier so its an important dynamic the good thing and i think weve talked about this in the past is that we are coming to this cycle and were operating say three quarters from beginning to end with a pretty favorable position where we saw really attractive loan opportunities we could in fact fund them with noncustomer source of funding and an increased loan to deposit ratio but thats not the default position for now and i think for now i think getting loans and deposits growing at a pretty similar rate is quite healthy and a good balance for us ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and a followup can you try to help us understand how the benefits from the securities swaps look this quarter and then as you go forward into next year just your loan hedges does that become a part of the benefit next year in terms of getting that nii starting to move the right way thanks zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah it does great question ken let me elaborate on that so up through the early part of q3 inclusive of activities weve done some in the first few weeks of this quarter weve got around billion of down rate hedge protection through received fixed swaps and its around billion billion weve got some floor spreads which pay off under the down rate scenarios and then a portfolio of collars which are the option to enter into receiving fixed swaps in the future and likely will if indiscernible try to come generally where theyre expected to so its a pretty powerful portfolio its full of extent now and even more that it will be extent over the coming to months as we enter into those collarbased receivefixed swaps the impact obviously the challenge in down rate hedging right now is there was an inverted yield curve and frankly with a fairly steep decline already forecasted weve got to assume pretty dire down rate scenarios to convince yourself it makes sense incrementally and youll receive fixed right now given the negative carry right now what were experiencing in the pl at this moment is about basis points of negative nim drag from the receivefixed that were already in and that will go to essentially zero by the end of if you follow up the forward yield curve scenario so thats basis points of tailwind that we should see in nim between now and the end of fairly ratable clawback drawback period ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc got it very helpful thank you huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc youre welcome operator thank you our next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets please proceed with your questions jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc thanks good morning guys stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc good morning jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc couple of credit questions first of all congratulations rich on your retirement richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc thanks jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc youve done a great job and ive enjoyed your perspective on these calls commercial real estate and consumer question so on commercial real estate how far ahead can you guys look in terms of identifying future issues i know its been a focus for you guys to tighten things up but curious what youre doing now and it obviously looks very clean but you have a fair amount of reserves allocated to the business and thats kind of why i ask richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah were looking were focused primarily right now on the and impacts and its really hard to look much further beyond that so were doing quarterly portfolio reviews in office were touching the real estate book every month i think weve probably gone through of the loans over million in that book at this point but the focus is on and and managing what we can control and that really relates to the maturities and then particularly with respect to office the lease rollovers that might be impacting cash flow in this year and next so thats the primary focus beyond that its tough you mentioned the reserve weve got against office weve got a reserve against the overall cre book we feel for what we know right now both of those are adequate and well continue to look at those on a quarter byquarter basis jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 okay stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc jon theres also jon rich is also would continue getting loans rebalanced whenever there appear to be issues there are proactive efforts to try and get those addressed paydowns possible indiscernible and the primary focus is but theres also a long view a full view of the portfolio over the next decade and these roles and other related issues all of which were actively managing weve been doing that for over a year and trying to stay well ahead of where any issues may occur and at this point the book is in really good shape jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah it seems that way okay and then on consumer i look at this every quarter just your nonaccruals and chargeoffs and its just kind of its nothing really maybe it goes to the soft landing comments but you look at rv marine consumer categories delinquencies really havent budged are you seeing anything in consumer health that bothers you at all because just these numbers are really really good richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc no the numbers are really good and i think it goes to the client selection and just the focus that weve got on prime super prime if you look across the entire consumer spectrum theres really nothing in there that would lead you to believe that were going to have anything more than just a gradual return to what might be more normalized levels of chargeoffs because right now to your point were running extremely low the only area that i would point out thats a little bit relatively higher stressed than the rest of the book is indiscernible and thats because of the floating rate nature of that portfolio so its going to be to a little higher level of delinquencies than you might see across the book but the analysis that weve done from a vintage standpoint on that book show that were in the to loan to value range so you might see higher levels of delinquency we dont think the losses will follow stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc the housing markets are generally tight where we are jon so if someone has and unemployment is very low so if someone has an issue the best resolution is to sell the property unlike what we might have seen in or prior indiscernible just to give rich a little credit here and recognition weve been at an effort to outperform our peers for over a decade with this aggregate moderate to low risk profile and hes been very very disciplined about that and we expect to outperform through the cycle weve been sharing that all along at this point were looking really good in that regard and attribute to all my colleagues especially rich in his leadership jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah yeah i agree steve i was thinking you could give him a fishing boat or an rv out of the foreclosure pool indiscernible anything to give huntington bancshares inc hban corrected transcript q2 earnings call 21jul2023 stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc we just dont have any other outlets sorry rich richard a pohle a chief credit officer executive vice president huntington bancshares inc indiscernible stephen d steinour a chairman president chief executive officer huntington bancshares inc theres some old posters wed pull those out jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc all right just to clean up for you zach the from million to million on the capstone torana what drove that i know its small million but what happened there zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc yeah thats really thats reflective of the cost that we see in that previous million was mainly capstone and has a factor of production and revenues that flow through into compensation expense and so when capital markets revenues were a bit softer in the second quarter our outlook is somewhat lower than was originally budgeted into the back half of the year still proud of them but just less flow through into indiscernible thats basically it jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay and then the million fdic thats all in the third quarter is that correct zachary j wasserman a chief financial officer senior executive vice president huntington bancshares inc so let me clarify that its a really important one that fdic expense that we talked about in that guidance is the basis points higher assessments that is being assessed across the industry and then was known late last year and its coming due every quarter its not the special assessment thats still being discussed jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay thank you i appreciate that operator thank you ladies and gentlemen this concludes our questionandanswer session ill turn the floor back to mr steinour for any
