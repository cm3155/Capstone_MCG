call over to jack john p barnes chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you andrew good afternoon we appreciate everyone joining us today and hope you and your loved ones are remaining safe and healthy before discussing results i want to take a moment to thank our employees customers and communities we serve for their perseverance and ability during this pandemic since the onset of the crisis many have said we are all in this together this sentiment is true and reflected in the daily interactions between our employees and customers to move forward in a socially distant environment and through our engagement with community organizations to provide relief to those most in need their ability to confront challenges together has in the past and continues today to forge and solidify relationships between peoples united and our customers we strive to further strengthen these relationships as we play a critical role in supporting the financial health of individuals businesses and communities throughout this crisis and beyond as i mentioned last quarter we entered this crisis in a position of strength our performance in the second quarter was not only indicative of this strength but also the resilience of the franchise preprovision net revenues of million on an operating basis increased from the prior year quarter and benefited from higher net interest income and ongoing success controlling costs we also continued to produce positive operating leverage as evidenced by a basis point improvement yearoveryear in the efficiency ratio to these results are reflective of the material cost savings that we have achieved from recent acquisitions and help to generate a tangible book value per share of an increase of from a year ago the net interest margin of was basis points lower compared to reported in both the linked and prioryear quarters the margin compression mostly reflects the downward pricing of floating rate loans partially peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 offset by meaningfully lower deposits and borrowing costs periodend loans and deposits increased and respectively linked quarter excluding ppp loans loans decreased largely due to lower commercial real estate balances and our planned reduction in residential mortgages deposits primarily benefited from ppp funds federal stimulus payments and higher municipal balances notably strong deposit inflows reduced the loantodeposit ratio to from at the end of the first quarter clearly the pandemic has significantly impacted the economy although as the second quarter progress we did see a modest uptick in business activity from the lows earlier in the period in particular mortgage warehouse results continued to be strong as expected residential mortgage originations were robust in our retail channel but were more than offset by payoffs in commercial real estate and ci originations remain modest unlike many banks we did not experience a high level of line draws and ci utilization rates have remained steady this is a reflection of the strength of our customer base and their confidence in our ability to support their funding needs new business in equipment finance has been subdued with the exception of lease where we have seen signs of increasing activity while new business activity has been modest our focus is on maintaining a high level of communication with customers we have continued to serve customers in the manner in which they want to be served either in person with the personal social distancing protocols via our digital channels or virtually through video meetings this has enabled our relationship managers branch personnel and wealth management advisors to successfully transact with customers and be responsive to their needs we are pleased that effective july all of our branches return to normal operations given the favorable pandemic trends across our footprint with that said our top priority remains the health and wellbeing of our employees and customers consistent with our history on providing support in times of need we are committed to helping customers navigate through this crisis as of july we have funded nearly ppp loans totaling over billion which have supported the paychecks of more than employees across the northeast companies that received ppp loans through us have an average of employees some industries funded include social services healthcare retail professional services and construction approximately of these loans were under we also registered for the main street lending program to further support small and midsized businesses where appropriate we granted loan forbearances at quarterend we have approved more than loans for deferral totaling over billion comprised of billion in commercial and billion in equipment finance and billion in retail positively the trends in the initial forbearance requests have slowed materially and we have been pleased to receive payments from of the accounts representing of loan balance since they were in deferral we also continue to assess the needs of customers that may require extended relief second round forbearance requests are subject to a more extensive due diligence and credit analysis to confirm additional relief is needed as well as viability of the business in this new economic environment while still early in the process based on conversations across our customer base we expect second round forbearance levels will be meaningfully less than the first we believe this is a testament to our approach to relationship banking and reflects the strong capital and liquidity profile of our customers peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 turning to slide clearly during the duration of the pandemic it is unpredictable and the total impact on the economy is unknown however we remain confident that our longheld underwriting philosophy and diversified loan portfolio comprised of highquality cycletested customers will once again differentiate peoples united our conservative business model is advantageous especially in the challenging economic conditions one of the strategic objectives of our risk management is running a diversified portfolio that does not overly expose the bank to a single line of business all of our relationship managers are highly credit trained and remain with customers through the entire life cycle of the loan this enables our sales force to develop significant knowledge of each relationship and facilitate detailed conversations with borrowers as such in times of economic stress these deep relationships allow us to quickly transition from a new business mindset to a capital preservation focus that is empathetic with the needs of the customer with that background in mind on slide we have once again provided our exposure to sectors significantly impacted by covid19 similar to last quarter we have included the retail hospitality and restaurant sectors as an update this quarter we have refined the retail disclosure to display only loans managed by our commercial real estate lending teams its important to reiterate our conservative view of underwriting enables us to enter this crisis in a position of strength credit metrics across each of our portfolios including these sectors were at very strong levels balances in the cre retail portfolio are billion importantly we do not have material exposure to enclosed retail malls and essential tenants comprise approximately half of the portfolio these include grocery stores pharmacies and big box home improvement locations in addition we have been pleased to see a meaningful improvement in rent collection trends for retail customers we deemed at risk prepandemic rent collections were near but declined to by the end of may based on conversations with customers we expect rent collections to be approximately by the end of july deferrals at quarterend were billion for the cre retail portfolio given the portfolios concentration of essential tenants we expect second deferral requests will be significantly less than the initial round balances in the hospitality portfolio are billion of which is managed by our cre lending teams the majority of the portfolio is flagged by major hotel brands and comprised of economy to upper midscale properties in terms of occupancy these properties have fared better than upscale and luxury properties across the industry our top clients account for over of our cre hotel exposure each of these sponsors are cycletested have extensive hotel experience and are long tenured customers of peoples united deferrals were million for the total hospitality portfolio at quarterend while occupancy has steadily improved since the onset of pandemic we expect most customers to apply for a second deferral balances in the restaurant portfolio are million of which approximately are managed within ci including the traditional ci and the segments franchise finance specialized industry vertical the remainder of the portfolio is managed in equipment finance the majority of the franchise portfolio is in quick service restaurants which have experienced a lesser degree of disruption especially where drivethru traffic remains strong peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 deferrals at quarterend were million for the total restaurant portfolio many of our customers are coming to an end of the first 90day deferrals and presently only a few have requested another round of relief before moving on its also worth noting the continued high rent collection rates in our multifamily and office building portfolios the average collection rate for our top multifamily loans is in the high range and in the high range for our top office building loans looking forward undoubtedly the nearterm impacts of the pandemic are a top of mind for every banks management team however it is clear to us that coming years will look much different from past and therefore we remain keenly focused on investing in the franchise for the long term in particular we are actively pursuing ways to further strengthen our digital capabilities and enhance our already broad array of products and services offerings to meet the everchanging needs of customers as such we are excited by the recent formation of our business transformation office which is responsible for digitization product strategy management process automation and fintech partnerships the business transformation office is unlike any other group we have had at peoples united and will further drive our ability to innovate and reconceptualize offerings this team will not only provide a competitive advantage by enabling us to stay ahead of customer needs but also ensure that our strategic plan successfully advance the franchise consistent with the theme of meeting customer needs were pleased to introduce alwayschecking earlier this month we are offering this premium digital identity protection service free to all personal checking account customers peoples united is proud to provide this level of digital identity protection benefits that will further differentiate the bank this offering builds on our core value proposition of service and protection and we are confident alwayschecking will further attract and retain customers throughout the franchise before turning the call over to david to discuss the second quarter results in more detail i wanted to congratulate dave berey our now former chief credit officer whose wellplanned retirement earlier this month concluded more than years with peoples united his thoughtful leadership has been instrumental to the bank as his many many contributions thank you dave for your dedication and we wish you all the best we are excited to welcome rich barry as our new chief credit officer rich joins us from keycorp where he was chief credit officer and he brings with him more than years of proven experience managing risk and growing businesses including during times of adverse conditions his deep knowledge of our northeast footprint and experience working at larger peer banks which also includes holding the role of connecticut market president at citizens will significantly benefit peoples united with that here is david r david rosato senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc thank you jack our second quarter financial results compared to the prior year quarter were highlighted by a increase in operating preprovision net revenue and a basis point improvement in the efficiency ratio we also maintained excellent asset quality as evidenced by net loan chargeoffs to average total loans of basis points peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 operating earnings of million or per common share included a provision of million which reflected the continued impact of covid19 the million increase in the provision linked quarter was driven by a weaker economic forecast our current economic modeling reflects both a baseline economic forecast as of late june and a more adverse scenario which each weakened compared to the end of the first quarter given higher unemployment sharper gdp contraction and a longer expected recovery timeline into the first half of on slide we break down the allowance for credit losses by portfolio segment total allowance at june of million up from million at the end of the first quarter provides significant coverage as it represents more than times our annualized second quarter net chargeoffs and of nonperforming loans notable changes to segment allowancetoloan ratios include ci which declined basis points linked quarter to basis points due to the addition of ppp loans excluding ppp the ci allowance equals basis points and the total allowance is basis points equipment finance increased basis points to reflective of the portfolios shorter duration loans the average life of the equipment finance portfolio is approximately two years which under cecl most cash flows do not revert to longterm historical loss rates and makes them highly dependent on the economic scenario model moving to slide net interest income of million increased million or from the first quarter the loan portfolio unfavorably impacted net interest income by million in addition lower yields in the securities portfolio reduced net interest income by million these headwinds were more than offset by lower deposit and borrowing costs which benefited net interest income by million and million respectively of note net interest income benefited approximately million from ppp during the quarter which reflects million in related fees and million in net interest income as displayed on side net interest margin of was basis points lower than the first quarter the loan portfolio negatively impacted the margin by basis points driven by the downward repricing of floating rate loans in addition lower security yields reduced the margin by basis points partially offsetting these negative effects was our continued discipline managing deposit pricing and lower borrowing costs which favorably impacted the margin by basis points and basis points respectively across the franchise our line of business leaders did a remarkable job working with customers and managing deposit costs lower average deposit costs were basis points in the second quarter compared to basis points in the first quarter while borrowing costs improved basis points over the same period the net impact on the margin from ppp was negligible in the second quarter as the loans were not on the books for the full three months looking ahead we expect ppp will have approximately a basis point unfavorable impact on the margin in each of the next two quarters turning to loans on slide average balances were up billion or in the first quarter while period end loans increased billion or growth on both an average and period end basis was concentrated in the ci portfolio driven by the addition of ppp loans and strong mortgage warehouse results average balances also benefited from equipment finance due to the continued growth in lease it is important to note in connection with united bank core system conversion in early april approximately million of loans secured by owner occupied commercial properties were prospectively reclassified from commercial real estate to ci excluding ppp loans declined on both an average and period end basis peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 average loans decreased million or less than from the first quarter while period end balances were down billion or the largest driver of the decline in period end loans was a million reduction in residential mortgages as we continue to remix the balance sheet with a focus on higher yielding portfolios in addition adjusting for the reclassification middle market ci was down over million while cre and asset based lending balances declined approximately million and million respectively balances in the transactional portion of the new york multifamily portfolio which is in runoff mode ended the quarter at million down million linked quarter and million yeartodate in addition the period end balance for the united loans we have chosen to runoff was million a decline of million from march and million since yearend we continue to expect run off of million to million for each of these portfolios for the full year moving onto deposits on slide average balances were up billion or from the first quarter while period end deposits increased billion or growth on both an average and period end basis was primarily driven by inflows of ppp funds and federal stimulus payments as well as higher municipal balances notably a billion increase in noninterestbearing deposits was the largest driver of the higher average balances in the quarter at june noninterestbearing deposits accounted for more than of total period end balances up from at the close of the first quarter looking forward as customers further utilize ppp funds and federal stimulus payments we anticipate deposit balances to abate in the second half of the year our funding and liquidity profile remains strong with a secured borrowing capacity of billion at quarterend comprised of billion in federal home loan bank capacity billion in unpledged securities and billion in federal reserve bank pledged loans looking at slide noninterest income of million was down million or strong first quarter results the largest driver of the decline was a million in lower net gains from sale of loans as a reminder the first quarter included a million gain related to the sale of loans acquired in the united transactions excluding gains on the net sale of loans noninterest income decreased million and was primarily driven by lower levels of customer activity and fee waivers related to covid19 relief measures specifically this decline reflected a million decrease in bank service charges inclusive of fee waivers million in lower customer interest rate swap income million in lower insurance revenues reflecting the seasonality of commercial insurance renewals and a million reduction in commercial banking lending fees primarily due to lower loan prepayment fees in equipment finance overall the net impact on noninterest income in the second quarter from fee waivers was approximately million on slide noninterest expense of million declined million linked quarter the second quarter included million of nonoperating costs up from the first quarter and were in the following categories million in other noninterest expense primarily driven by branch closures related to the united transaction million in professional and outside services million in compensation and benefits and in occupancy and equipment excluding nonoperating cost noninterest expense of million was down million or compared to the first quarter the largest driver of this improvement was a million decline in compensation and benefits due to lower payroll and healthcarerelated costs occupancy and equipment costs were favorable by million travel and peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 meetingrelated expenditures were lower by million primarily due to the impact of covid19 and advertising and promotion and professional and outside services costs collectively decreased net interest expense by million primarily as a result of timing briefly on slide you can see the efficiency ratio improvement compared to the prior year quarter our efficiency ratio is a product of our ability to generate positive operating leverage and in particular realize the projected cost takeouts from acquisitions as referenced earlier we sustained excellent asset quality and answered the pandemic in a position of strength as displayed on slide net loan charge offs to average total loans were basis points an improvement of basis points from the first quarter nonperforming assets as a percentage of loans and reo of basis points was basis points higher linked quarter this increase was primarily driven by two accounts one represented a ci account which was experiencing difficulties prior to the pandemic the other was an acquired commercial real estate loan turning to slide return on average assets of basis points or basis points on an operating basis and return on average tangible common equity of or on an operating basis were down compared to recent quarters the decline in these returns in the second quarter was primarily driven by the elevated provision resulting from the impact of covid19 finally on slide we remain comfortable with our capital structure and balance sheet strength capital ratios continue to be strong given our diversified business mix and long history of exceptional risk management its important to note adjusting for ppp loans the pro forma tier leverage ratio at period end would be for the holding company and for the bank additionally the tce ratio excluding ppp would be versus the reported this concludes our prepared remarks well be happy to answer any questions you may have operator were ready for questions peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen we are ready to open the lines up for your question operator instructions and your first question comes from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thanks good evening guys john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hey ken ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i guess the first question just in terms of the ppp loans if i heard correctly youre expecting a basis points negative hit to nim over the next couple quarters due to the ppp loans im kind of assuming that theres obviously no accelerated payoffs in there and youre probably not assuming anything other than this twoyear pay off i guess or full amortization of these loans but even under those assumptions like your nim is call it roughly i think most of the banks were hearing from say the fully i guess amortized yield or the full yield on these loans are something over assuming that with any kind of accelerated payoffs im just trying to understand like why is this a negative to your nim like what are you assuming in terms of like the loan yields with the payoffs that is resulting in such a low or a hit thank you john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc sure sure ken so i mean youre correct were basically assuming that the vast majority of those loans will be on for two years theres a few that could possibly go by just at the tail end i would say the average loan is about under those assumptions average loan yield the reason we made the statement negligible in the first quarter it was a small negative the only difference im sorry second quarter not first quarter the only real difference between second quarter versus third and fourth is that the loans werent all on the books for the full quarter in q2 but we assumed they will be in q3 and q4 operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dave rochester with compass point dave rochester q analyst compass point hey good evening guys john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi dave peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 dave rochester q analyst compass point good evening just a quick one on the credits its really encouraging to hear your expectations on the retail cre collections i was just wondering what you guys are hearing from your customers that gives you confidence that that collection rate is going to effectively if i heard correctly double by the end of july are you getting like weekly cash flow data from these guys or seeing anything else any color there would be great john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah well were having a lot of conversation with customers across all of our businesses and in that particular area our real estate group you know collected data from those conversations with customers and information and that was kind of tabulated carried forward i dont know if you want to describe that jeff any differently jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc no i think thats right jack what weve been doing is having real robust conversations with all of our commercial real estate customers in particular focusing on places like you know retail and so the comments were making is kind of a just a collection of all of the information were hearing back from our customers they have seen increasing trends in rent collections of course its difficult to predict what the second half of the year looks like but as we sit here today theyve been steadily increasing since the start of the pandemic so clearly in a much better position today than they were three months ago dave rochester q analyst compass point yes definitely dave just one quick followup are you seeing any difference in either collection activity or the underlying metrics between your originated book and your acquired books r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc hi this is jeff r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hey dave jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc i think its difficult to break it out like that the short answer is i dont know my intuition is i dont think so but we havent analyzed it that way peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i would just add if you look at our delinquencies nonperformers et cetera where weve really still not done something but were not impacted yet that very low so theres nothing showing up in our acquired portfolios that are changing those numbers dave rochester q analyst compass point okay great and maybe just one last one on expenses obviously theres some good expense control this quarter just wondering what what youre thinking about for the puts and takes of the expense run rate going forward and if this is a good run rate just excluding all the charges and whatnot thanks john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc sure dave ill take that so the way i would think about it is as you know we gave guidance in january guidance around expenses was billion to billion our thinking today is that well be right around the lower end of that guidance by the time the year is all said and done dave rochester q analyst compass point all right great thanks guys john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc thank you dave operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jared shaw with wells fargo jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good evening john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hey jared r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just wanted to say congratulations to dave hope he enjoys his retirement peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting with credit can you give an update on what youre seeing from deferral levels as weve entered here in july and it seems like most other places are seeing pretty substantial declines do you have any updated numbers on where deferral stands either today or recently john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah were well i guess wed say were cautiously optimistic we jeff just described those conversations that were having across the businesses and it certainly includes the people that got deferrals when we were overall and the deferral level which i think reflected our trying to be very accommodating to our customers at that initial phase most of the deferrals were granted in late march early april and so right now and as we speak theres a pretty significant number of those conversations have taken place in the last days to try to gauge and anticipate how many will be asking for a second and we mentioned in our comments we think the hospitality group definitely will need it and well definitely accommodate them weve been talking to them regularly and theyre as you described very good longterm customers so we want them in the properties and the other kind of broader levels there we would say i think its going to be meaningfully below in terms of second requests in a lot of the portfolios were not anticipating lifts at all so the conversations have been positive many many people have told us now that theyve gotten through the initial shock and theyve kind of reevaluated their operation and the impact there they wont be asking for a second deferral so i would say we feel pretty good about it jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color when you look at the ones that youre more concerned about or that may need a longer term deferral would you be more inclined to try to come up with some type of a formal restructuring and move it off of deferral by yearend or would you be more inclined to utilize the longer duration deferral that the cares act allows john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah so if we were to grant that second deferral then were hitting that days which we would use i would say and then during that period wed be evaluating what kind of restructuring if any is needed so i would say different types of businesses different types of properties its probably kind of difficult to describe what kind of restructuring wed do but we would use the day period and then we would kind of have to go from there unless the regulators and accountants extend that period jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then just finally from me when you look at the equipment finance and having to put a big cecl provision on that does that really make it less attractive to put on any new equipment finance loans right now or peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 would you still be putting on equipment finance loans today even though you may have to put a bigger provision associated with that day one john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah yeah i would ill give you an answer and ill let david or jeff contribute first of all know that doesnt discourage me at all with the lease and the equipment finance groups they are actually performing very well theyre doing well their credit history is really really good its much better than the industry and i really have no reason to think that the performance isnt going to continue this is kind of a case where cecl drives you because of the short duration period and the economic scenario to that higher provision once things calm down hopefully they do then that requirement will be for higher provisions will be reduced and well recover provisions in my mind jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i would say thats the perfect answer jack its just its one of those nuances of cecl similar to were carrying a reserve for residential mortgage larger than we think you need to but thats driven by the long duration of the assets where its the opposite with the equipment financing right now jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good evening this is alex lau on for steve starting off john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi alex alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc with reserves how much of the reserve build this quarter was tied to the change in economic forecasts as opposed to portfoliospecific changes and were qualitative overlays a material factor this quarter john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 i would say essentially all of the reserve build was due to economic scenario modeling the there are qualitative overlays as part of our process but the drive thats not wasnt really the driver it was just a as we referenced in our comments a weaker economic forecast than last quarter alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you and on to fees just one question on the million waived fees you mentioned can you talk about what youre doing on that front and how long do you expect this to continue for thanks john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc sure so the similar to forbearance in the first round we try to be as accommodating as possible to our customer base to help them through this time period of economic uncertainty we saw a as the quarter unfolded there was a reduction in fee waivers given across and this is mostly our retail base though they were still occurring as late as june so i would expect the impact to be substantially lasts in q3 than what you saw in q2 operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steven duong with rbc capital markets steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey good evening guys r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi steven steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah just a quick one do you have your the ltes and debt service coverage ratios for your deferred retail cre and your hospitality portfolios jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc not that were prepared on this call to share steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc got it okay and jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc i would say again this is jeff i would say that going into the pandemic we had underwritten really all of our commercial real estate portfolio but those segments in particular are on a pretty conservative basis so we felt good as good as you can be going into a pandemic obviously we didnt underwrite to a pandemic but feel pretty peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 good about going into the pandemic in terms of the leverage in the real estate portfolio and we actually talked about that on the call last quarter steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you and then just on the ppp fees how much in total fees did you guys book jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc within the quarter we booked million of fees steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc right and how much is remaining jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc the total fees were in the mid to upper million steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc as jack referenced in his comments majority of what we did was at the lowest tier loan size which has the highest fees steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and then just the last one you guys the reserves are based on the latest economic forecast so i guess is it fair to say if the economic forecast if the actual economy plays out similar to what the economic forecasts are right now then your provisioning should go back to what it was before jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc yes yeah it would settle down subject to loan growth of course steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc right right okay great i really appreciate it thank you guys jeffrey j tengel a president peoples united financial inc youre welcome peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of william wallace with raymond james william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc thanks for taking my question i just had two brief questions on deferrals youve stated that the experience or youre optimistic that the tier rates will be high on the deferrals that have come due or rolled off a deferral and then have had a payment what percentage of those have made their next payment versus gone to a second round john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc well most of the activities for the first deferral kind of would have just ended in the month of june then we had this july thing so weve only had the opportunity to see one payment so william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc youve only had one loan thats come up to a payment is that what youre saying john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc no im saying the loans that have gone into deferrals that are just coming out theyre just coming out in july so i thought you asked if theyre going to make a second payment and im saying that we havent had an opportunity to see the second payment william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc no no im sorry im saying what percentage have made the next payment their first payment after coming off of the ones that have come up on that payment due date r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc no theyre just coming off now so this is the first month and so yeah we dont to me that well know that month what i would focus i think whats probably more important is in jacks comment he referenced of the deferrals we granted while loans were in deferral approximately of the accounts and of the balances chose to pay even though we granted deferrals and he also said that we think the amount of deferrals will significantly decrease and will probably be less than half the original deferrals william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay okay so okay yeah as you think about reserve builds and can those loans that do go onto a second deferral do you think that would you anticipate youd have some continued though milder reserve builds due to downgrades of those loans r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 yeah what i would go back to is the level of provision expense primarily governed by the economic scenario right number one levels of a lot of the kind of metric data that goes into our models some of our models are dependent on internal risk rating but not all of them william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay all right thank you r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc but just one further comment our allowance process does incorporate some downside risk of lower internal risk ratings as well william j wallace q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you very much appreciate the color operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dollyn gilbert sic collyn gilbert with kbw collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good afternoon guys r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc hi collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc im not sure if he started that with a d or a c but nonetheless its a long day john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc yeah collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc so just to start on the borrowing pay down so that was a pretty dramatic pay down in the quarter there and obviously really meaningfully reduced the cost i think youre probably down to like basis points on borrowing costs david how is that setting up the margin for the third quarter and then what was kind of the strategy or the reasoning behind that or at what point did you decide to kind of pull the trigger on paying down those borrowings peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc its good question collyn what i would say is most of our treasury borrowing book we tend to keep relatively short so it was we could just naturally pay it off we didnt have to extinguish home loan bank borrowings or anything like that so you make a decision to either balloon the balance sheet right or just kind of let that deposit inflows pay down those borrowings which is what we chose you did see a small increase in cash and due on the balance sheet so we did have higher levels of cash with the federal reservenbut the more important part of the question i think is how that set up the margin for the back half of the year we were very successful in deposit costs lowering them theres still some opportunities though not as great from q1 to q2 it will be we have less opportunity obviously from q2 to q3 and q4 probably the biggest driver will be just our cd books pricing down as well as customer preference is for liquidity so we saw balances go from cds in the money markets and checking accounts as well so we still have some positive tweaking to do there some natural roll on the deposit side collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just the timing of the borrowing pay down i guess is another kind of part two of that question to determine what the impact might be in the third quarter on the nim r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah i mean its the level of borrowing if the deposit inflows growth that we had roughly stays the same the borrowing base isnt going to change unless its really going to be dependent on loan growth in the back half of the year we have robust loan growth or even better loan growth mild to up loan growth there will be a funding need john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc i thought collyn was trying to ask how rapidly we paid down the borrowings during the second quarter was that it collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah just to see where the yeah where are the savings right i mean if youre starting at i think you started borrowings at in the first quarter they dropped to basis points so is that just trying to understand this yeah how much more savings could be seen in the third quarter r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc yeah those borrowings came down and they were more frontloaded in the quarter than backloaded collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc number one were driven by the ppp loans coming in because that money sat there and then lastly by the stimulus collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay all right r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc sorry about that collyn collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no no no thats okay thats okay thats helpful okay and then just going back to credit so i know this has been asked a lot but just curious i think it was probably as late in the quarter as maybe early june where i thought the view was perhaps consistent with what you guys said following one quarter that that provision would likely kind of be in the same range in the second quarter as it was in the first quarter and i guess if we look at where the economy was in early june while maybe you had not implemented your actual economic forecast at that point i guess just qualitatively im just trying to connect the dots there because i thought the messaging in early june was that the provision would be comparable to first quarter and yet obviously it came in meaningfully higher so beyond the economic model input anything else there that changed that viewpoint r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc well i mean from my perspective on the call in april we were telegraphing slightly up is the way i would characterize it we left open the possibility for a higher provision in q2 june economic data is really the driver here but it was definitely weaker than march collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay okay and then lastly i think if im doing the math right and if the numbers are right i thought after the first quarter you had indicated there was like about million im sorry billion of loans you identified kind of as risky and then in the release and the deck this quarter it looks like billion and it looks like the drop was on the retail cre side did something happen within that book that you maybe would characterized it jeffrey a hoyt a chief accounting officer senior vice president peoples united bank na bridgeport connecticut yeah that was actually jack alluded to in his comments so we find the definition of commercial retail of retail cre and we were too broad in hindsight in q1 so what we the number were focusing on is the what is managed by our commercial real estate lending teams there was some middle market cre in the first quarter number peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 collyn gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay got it okay thanks jeff okay okay that was all i had thank you jeffrey a hoyt a chief accounting officer senior vice president peoples united bank na bridgeport connecticut youre welcome operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens inc matthew breese q analyst stephens inc good evening john p barnes a chairman chief executive officer peoples united financial inc hi matt matthew breese q analyst stephens inc sorry if i missed it but did you could you just characterize for us what the core nim might look like both in the medium and really like a year out from now if interest rates were to be unchanged what could the core nim migrate to r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc leave it to you to ask the hardest question while weve suspended guidance because of the fluidity of the situation what i would say matt is theres clearly more forces taking the nim down than the nim up so shape of the yield curve that policy i think consensus is rates arent really going to change or go up anytime soon so theres definitely pressure on the nim in the quarter i think we were very successful in managing deposit costs i tried to say and answer to collyns questions that we still have some more to do on the deposit cost side but its not nearly as much as we were able to do in the second quarter the loan spreads held up in the quarter but there wasnt a lot of volume if the situation gets worse the economy gets worse credit spreads are going to widen so when you have opportunities we will lend to small customers we will be lending at wider spreads so i dont want to talk about where we think nim might be in at this point but i can see the nim falling below obviously and i could see it in the a 280ish type range over time matthew breese q analyst stephens inc peoples united financial inc pbct corrected transcript q2 earnings call 23jul2020 understood okay and then to what extent did loans on deferral contribute to net interest income this quarter and just hypothetically speaking if deferrals were to go to nonperforming asset would therefore be backed out of nii r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc im sorry matt i missed that question matthew breese q analyst stephens inc well the loans on full deferral youre not collecting principal or interest yet youre accruing the interest in net interest income r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc to what extent did that impact the nim this quarter r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc so it was in its in the nim so as you stated we they are on deferral but were accruing that interest so it really didnt have an impact on the nim in the quarter matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then my last one is just on could you provide some color on your goodwill impairment evaluation process and whether or not thats necessary at this point and then practically speaking if there is the need to take in an impairment would that factor in to your ability to pay the dividend r david rosato a senior executive vice president chief financial officer peoples united financial inc a couple questions there what i would say is obviously as part of each quarter we think about goodwill impairment and whether its necessary the factors that we discuss that as we go down that path internally and in talks with our outside accountants is that the factors arent present for goodwill impairment for us to have to go and do a full analysis thats driven by the fact that there is i think the last time we saw the full assessment there were large cushions in goodwill so we dont think thats an event thats i mean obviously we have to go through the process each quarter but it is not something were expecting as we sit here today so id rather not speculate on if that happened what impact that might have on the ability to pay a dividend matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay understood thats all i had thanks for taking my questions peoples united financial inc pbct corrected
