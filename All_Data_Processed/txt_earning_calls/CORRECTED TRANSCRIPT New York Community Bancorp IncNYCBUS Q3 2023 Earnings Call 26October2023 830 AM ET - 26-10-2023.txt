earlier this month we announced solid operating results for the third quarter of the year our performance reflects our ongoing diversification efforts on both sides of the balance sheet arising from the combination of three legacy banks among this quarters highlights was good linkedquarter loan growth stable deposit trends and a significantly higher net interest margin we also made further progress in improving our funding mix as both wholesale borrowings and brokered cds declined while noninterest bearing deposits remain approximately onethird of total deposits virtually unchanged from the previous quarter from a net income and earnings perspective we reported net income available to common stockholders of million or per diluted share as adjusted ph for mergerrelated expenses our eps this quarter was better than consensus one of the drivers this quarter was a much higher net interest margin the nim came in at up basis points compared to the prior quarter and well ahead of our guidance range of to the increase was driven by higher asset yields as we continue to benefit from the higher interest rate environment and a higher average balance of noninterestbearing deposits compared to last quarter we remain constructive on the net interest margin going forward due to the continuing positive shift in our funding mix and the impact of higher asset yields another driver was our loan growth total loans during the third quarter new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 were up modestly as growth in the ci portfolio led by our specialty finance businesses and in homebuilder finance offset declines in other businesses overall the loan portfolio ended the quarter at billion up over million or compared to the prior quarter at september total commercial loans represented of total loans reflecting a significant diversification compared to where we stood a year ago turning now to deposits our deposit trends in the third quarter were relatively stable total deposits were billion billion lower compared to the billion at june the majority of the decline was due to a billion decrease in custodial deposits related to the signature transaction which totaled billion at the end of the quarter compared to billion last quarter in addition brokered deposits declined billion to billion compared to the previous quarter excluding these two items deposits were down less than on a linked quarter basis additionally our funding mix continues to improve as wholesale borrowings declined compared to the previous quarter overall they are down or nearly billion since yearend in the fourth quarter we had approximately billion of wholesale bonds at a weighted average rate of that either a maturing or can be ph called by the fhlb turning now to asset quality while early stage delinquency declined significantly total nonperforming loans increased million or to ph million compared to the prior quarter due to the increase in the cre portfolio more specifically the increase was related to two officerelated loans one of which was in syracuse new york totalling million and the other in manhattan totaling million despite the increase in npls our asset quality metrics remain strong as npls to total loans were basis points compared to basis points last quarter while our net chargeoffs were also up or near basis points as average loans also as you can see on slide to in our investor presentation material our asset quality metrics remains solid and continues to rank among the best relative to the industry in our peers the strong metrics reflect our conservative underwriting standards which have served us well over multiple business cycles turning now to our guidance for the fourth quarter we expect the nim in the range of to mortgage gain on sale of million to million and net return on msr assets of to loan admin income of million annualized operating expense range of billion to billion and a full year tax rate of also during the quarter we unveiled our modern new brand and logo combining the best elements of all three legacy banks our teammates are excited about this new branding and im excited as well even though it will be a new logo and a brand the meaning behind it does not change we remain committed to helping our customers and teammates thrive as we move to one bank one brand one culture as the new flagstar finally i would like to say a special thank you to all of our teammates our results would not be possible without their dedication and commitment to our client and our customers with that we would be happy to answer any questions you may have well do our very best to get all of you within the time remaining but if we dont please feel free to call us later today or during the week operator please open the line for questions new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question will come from the line of david rochester with compass point please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning dave david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good morning guys just on the margin guide whats your assumption for custodial deposits baked into that and what does the average balance for those in the quarter thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc right so the big move is we talked about last quarter on the custodial deposits is really coming from the fund banking loans theyre the ones that are paying down pretty quickly so those are the deposits that were holding as you may know the fdic has announced the sale of that portfolio so that will transfer at the end of this month so in the next couple of days so were going to see that number drop dramatically when we hit november because the rest of the custodial deposits will be related to the multifamily and the cre loans and those paydowns are significantly less than on the fund banking side so the average balance is around billion for the quarter billion at the end of the quarter and then dropped dramatically once we get into november david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc so this margin guide really doesnt include much in the way of custodial deposits remaining thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats correct david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc great ill step back in the queue thanks guys thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thanks operator your next question will come from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning ebrahim how are you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good so tom maybe just start on asset quality means again you had pristine track record on asset quality when we think about one just address like the office portfolio your expectation around the lost content for your book relative to what we hear from the industry how welldeserved your community is for that book and then secondly also talk about the health of the multifamily landlords in new york like youre hearing a lot more concern around the rent regulation limiting the ability to raise rents and thats going to squeeze these the landlords so if you can address the office and the health of the multifamily landlords thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start with the latter first so obviously the marketplace has changed significantly since the rent laws back in had changed and weve been monitoring that very carefully weve seen some significant success with our client book given the fact that we have a long history these are inplace families that have been doing this for multiple decades very ph confident in their longterm business strategies but they do a very strong job of managing their book of business and the generational business for the most part with that being said we have a very strong portfolio with low ltvs and we monitor it carefully and were seeing consistencies of payment were seeing the reaction to higher interest rates on the reset either sofr option or a fixed rate option then having the capacity and the ability to continue to pay and thats what were seeing so were not seeing any delinquency trends of any material at all in the multifamily space which is a positive again rates have significantly risen over the past year or so and it does have an impact to the cash flow but these are well in tune operators have been able to manage through that but the reality of the activity has been very slow we havent seen much activity at all i would say since ive been here this is my 26th year going to my 27th year now at the bank this is the slowest activity ive ever seen when it comes to property transactions the interest as far as buying and selling so it really is a relatively static or no activity whatsoever and well monitor that very carefully at the same time rents are up to the highest point in the city of new york so were getting very strong rentals and theyre managing through an inflationary environment so were very positive with respect to our portfolio but theres no question that indiscernible changes had an impact and the activity of taking the units to a free market unit has its different business model and our team is monitoring the statistics as far as how that impacts valuation how it impacts overall cap rates and its been relatively stable even despite the significant rise in interest rates in respect to the overall cre portfolio we have about billion in total cre and about billion indiscernible thats in manhattan new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc billion thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc about billion in manhattan this is one specific loan in the manhattan portfolio i believe its like an a type of credit were confident that we have value there so there was no i dont think there was a related chargeoff to that particular credit but its one loan so we have a very strong portfolio we have statistics that we put out in our slide presentation material it was very clear on the overall strength of the portfolio relatively low ltvs strong debt service coverage ratios very strong sponsorships but its not a trend and were monitoring it no question rates are much higher were still coming out of the pandemic were evaluating overall square footage in rentals and as far as leases coming due and exits of certain large clientele but its been a relatively stable scenario and despite the negativity youre reading about our portfolio is performing extremely well relevant to the marketplace ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful and maybe just one other one on expenses i think in the past youve said you expect expenses to stay flat next year versus this year one remind us in terms of where we are in realizing saving side to both the acquisitions how much more to go and do you still feel good about expenses staying flat it feels like youre making a lot of investments theres a lot going on at the bank so i would appreciate an update there thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so ill start and pass the baton to john the big picture is that i dont our guide is pretty much the same it was last quarter for john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and we havent given our guidance and clearly we are investing as you indicated into the infrastructure to build out past the billion now we understand our obligations there so we clearly are focusing on making this company at the point of the billion process to ensure that we have all of the requisite infrastructure and we spent a lot of money over the years to get this so we understand the path there at the same time were also investing into the market regarding our new partner with the signature transaction so we are adding talent to the pools of additional pcg team that also adds to the expense base thats where you sort of ramp up in the second and third quarter but the reality is that we have a very strong focus here to make sure that we have a history and this is just a history of managing a very strong efficiency ratio but also being cognizant of our obligations as a billion plus institution with that ill pass it to john new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah we havent given specific guidance yet for but how weve talked about it is that there are both headwinds and tailwinds into when you compare it to as tom mentioned we definitely have some additional adds both back office and through our pcg groups that are going to put pressure on the expense base going up along with just the additional expenses for being over billion and then the tailwinds of the systems conversions which we have the flagstar systems conversion scheduled in the first quarter so well start to see some benefits from that and then we have the signature conversion after that so those benefits will be later towards the later end of the year so thats kind of how we think about right now but well give our guidance at the next quarter thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ebrahim the only thing ill add to johns comments were still unwinding the legacy signature portfolio that we dont own so we do have costs associated with that that will be impacted favorably assuming that those assets do plot the institution go elsewhere so thats also that also be impacted into next year as well assuming that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah thats right the fdic has put out the mf and cre portfolios for sale we expect bids to be this quarter and well see what happens when that comes to pass ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey good morning john maybe just a question on the balance sheet to start a lot of movements with the deposits that you telegraphed but can you help us with just overall size of earning assets near term targeted cash levels youre building the bond book just help on the moving pieces for the next couple of quarters thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure yeah no no problem we have slowly started to build the securities portfolio really just a liquidity shift between cash and securities government securities very liquid just to try to monetize some asset sensitivity here and get closer to neutral thats been our plan back since march to get closer to neutral and we have each quarter were slightly asset sensitive right now and thatll continue to trend towards neutrality here in the next new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 quarter or so so i think when you look at where we are in interest earning assets the declines have basically stopped from the cash side this is about where well be within billion or so from a cash and securities perspective so you may see cash drop a little bit but that would be offset by incremental purchases on the security side so id say that the large drops are behind us on the cash and the liquidity front right weve paid down a lot of debt on the wholesale side and some brokerage side thatll be more limited going forward and then well look to grow certain areas of the loan portfolio where it makes sense strategically for the company where we have the best opportunity to bring in deposits related to those loans so i would say very limited change from the if you look at cash and securities combined going forward and then some hopefully some small growth on the loan side where it makes sense strategically christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay just if can follow up the you had million of earning assets in the quarter obviously timing of everything is related when you move stuff during the quarter but just zeroing in on that fourth quarter earning assets it feels like its going to be lower than those million but just any kind of finetuning indiscernible john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah but its not yeah not significantly lower than the million we expect it to be right around that number because i really dont see us dropping much more on the securities in total in the cash side so i expect thatll be pretty stable here and hopefully well be able to build that as our success on the deposit side starts to come through christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe just the last one on the loan and deposit you retooled that a bit how are you thinking about that entering is little high thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so chris its tom i would say that the strategy going forward here is relationship deposit story and all lines of the businesses right were a different company were focusing on new flagstar were focusing on getting ourselves to a commercial banking standard we recognize that historically weve had a very high loan to deposit ratio as a traditional thrift model thats history the goal here is to rightsize institutions to be more in line to commercial banking model we had the flagstar transaction and we had the opportunity to be participating in a receivership transaction which really changed the model in respect to the funding mix so the goal here is to bring that level inside of thats the goal here and continuing to focus on best practices in the industry and thats a more commercial bank model so im proud of the opportunity to diversify our lines and focus on the positive relationship lending if theres no deposit on the relationship well probably not going to make the loan its just that thats coming from the top of the house at the board level its very focused there that this is a great opportunity to take these three institutions under the new flagstar umbrella and focus on relationship banking we see it transforming actively on the multi new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 family cre side throughout the past few years weve had tremendous success with that model and thats going to be filtered to all of the lines of businesses thats going to be the strategy going forward christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks thanks guys operator your next question comes from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steven janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning this is janet lee for steve alexopoulos my first question is on your new hires as it relates to private banking team hires out of first republic are you seeing any more opportunities to hire new teams here over the near term thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill pass that over to ph eric eric a yeah hi good morning so weve hired in total now group directors and support staff so there was tremendous opportunity over the last couple of quarters to hire were very excited about the team members that weve brought on board and this is truly a tremendous opportunity to fill a massive void in the marketplace for serviceoriented institutions and were really happy with the talent that we brought on board in order to do that thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill just add a point to that the stability of the legacy signature teams are solid we had tremendous strength throughout the summer on stabilizing the team that was the business risk when we announced the transaction so theres been stability and as ph eric indicated an opportunity as well janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay great and as youre obviously growing and investing into a franchise do you expect to be able to achieve positive operating leverage next year is that a target that you have in mind thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thats the plan absolutely indiscernible goes through some of the mechanics on history weve done this for quite some time as far as how it goes into the runway but why dont you end expand upon that ph eric a well yeah it usually takes about to months right each team is different has a different book of business and underlying client base but well usually achieve positive leverage if you look to months out janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great my last question thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc just another point thats on the new team that came on board but obviously we have embedded within the franchise of close to team members from the legacy signature portfolio thats managing of course a billion deposit that has tremendous operating leverage for the franchise of which i think its probably close to of their deposit base is at zero a thats right janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it and can you give us an update on the progress of bringing back signature noninterestbearing deposits that have left during the third quarter and maybe todate has it accelerated versus the million that you brought in during the second quarter a yeah were really stable i mean we brought in nearly million again in deposits so they continue to flow back and thats in the face of obviously the most difficult deposit environment that weve seen in our careers for sure so were very pleased with the traction that were gaining we had growth in both the west coast banking teams and the east coast banking teams as well as the new frb teams that we brought on board so were seeing growth from all areas of our traditional banking teams thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill just add some comments there i spent most of the summer meeting both pcgs as well as our new client base and close to hands ive shaken for over the summer and it was amazing to see the connectivity between the pcg teams and the client and the loyalty factor behind that so were very proud of the team were proud that theyre able to go through a significant adverse time in march and see an opportunity here on the new flagstar and were very pleased with the success on the stability of the base new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 accounts are still there they may be cleaned out as far as some of the excess liquidity to the market but theyre not leaving the institution when it comes to the actual relationship but they ph did lose some significant deposits so when we did the transaction in march that institution was at a much higher base and when we stepped in its been stable which is a very positive signal for what we expected and as you can recall from the original deal mechanics we felt there would be further runoff just because of the unknown factor as we came into a very tumultuous time janet lee q analyst jpmorgan securities llc all right thanks for taking my questions thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of bernhard von gizycki with deutsche bank please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey good morning so just on purchase accounting accretion if you could just remind us on for the nim how much there was what the split was between flagstar and signature and based on your guide of nim what youre expecting john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc sure bernard if you look we did add a slide i dont know if you saw it in the earnings presentation around the purchase accounting accretion because we knew we were going to get some questions on that so it was about million that came in in september the split is about signature and about from the flagstar transaction from a forecasting perspective were expecting it to be a little bit lower than that in the fourth quarter not substantially we believe that we have another quarter or so at a pretty high run rate from the signature transaction giving how were seeing some pay downs we will see the flagstar piece start to slow down here as we get to the oneyear mark in december but right now thats where we kind of expected to be pretty close to that level around million bernard von gizycki q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just on deposits i know in the past you guys have talked about the bankingasaservice initiatives that you had i was just wondering if you could kind of remind us what you might have in the pipeline as you kind of think of how noninterestbearing deposits could trend maybe going into next year new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start off and then im going to defer it to reggie but i will tell you that the reality is that we have a lot of interesting opportunities in front of us we did mention about a year ago that we did successfully compete and actually win the opportunity within the california unemployment fund that should be coming on sometime early in thatll be a nice pickup for the institution with that being said theres so many different lines of businesses as well as opportunities id love to have reggie davis just share some thoughts on the deposit strategy because were really excited what we can do in the future so reggie if you dont mind reginald e davis a senior executive vice president presidentconsumer corporate banking new york community bancorp inc yeah sure tom so not a lot more to add around bankingasaservice in addition to what tom said but as you know that business kind of comes in from an opportunistic standpoint so weve got a lot in the pipeline and we feel really good about our prospects winning additional business but we dont try to project out exactly where that book is going to be i think where weve had a lot of success this year is in our consumable which that that tends to be a little bit more steady a little bit more predictable and i feel really good about where that retail business is positioned particularly given the tough environment the team has done a lot of really good work our relationship banking model this year really proved its value tremendous amount of stability in that book we actually brought both the branch teams together this year combined the back office were now operating under the same leadership structure same sales and service model that model change went really well no disruptions were in the process of introducing a more scaled and consistent sales culture across the entire network of branches its designed to create a great client experience and it will be uniquely flagstar positioned with the brand that tom talked about and if you kind of think about where we are theres a lot of upside in that business the legacy flagstar branches are still only able to open accounts in branch thats of our franchise about branches next year well be able to have online capabilities so we know that will actually increase our net acquisition this year for the first year we began using targeted digital marketing in our nycb footprint to drive new client acquisition thats gone well weve introduced a new skinny down version of our aipowered client relationship tool which is called nextgen sales in our nycb branches thats had tremendous impact we see increases in new account balances all those validated and then next year well be fully operational across the entire footprint with additional enhancements for that tool but we feel really good the portfolio has performed well this year quarteroverquarter were only down million which is less than most of the year weve had success with this hightouch model if you look at our weighted average cost its only up basis points since january against the fed funds increase of basis points so were really pleased with the retention in that portfolio and i think another good news story is from a cd renewal perspective weve been above the retention rate all year which is kind of top of class from an industry perspective we had of our cd book renewed between august and september we had retention rate on that average rate went from at ph at maturity to less than so positioned well below the kind of market leaders in terms of rate so we continue to be really optimistic around deposit its one of the success stories weve got this year thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 but as you can see we have a lot of enthusiasm under ph mr davis so thank you reggie i will tell you that the energy and thriving in this institution is the new focus for the institution so clearly reggie has a lot of interesting opportunity in front of us so were excited at this whole team so thank you for that reggie operator your next question will come from the line of mark fitzgibbon with piper sandler please go ahead mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co hey guys good morning i was wondering was any of the million provision this quarter did have any specific reserves in there for those two credits you singled out and have you reappraised those two properties john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so both of those two properties as they go through the process of nonperforming were both recently reappraised so the chargeoff on the syracuse loan was based of course on that most recent appraisal and then if you look at the million the bulk of the provision was one to really restore the allowance for the charge offs that we took as well as some small modest growth that we had some cre modeling changes through the moodys macroeconomic factor and then another more qualitative like factor related to the office portfolio thats kind of how it was broken apart to get to that million but yes both of those loans have recent appraisals on them and again were holding them now where we believe especially on that syracuse loan the writedown weve taken were very comfortable with where that is in the same process we use for decades when we take chargeoffs mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a follow up unrelated and this may seem like a hard thing to imagine right now but could you consider doing additional sort of troubled bank acquisitions if they came along and hopefully they dont but if there were some failed institutions in do you think its conceivable that you could do another transaction thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc hey mark its tom i will tell you that we are laserfocused on building new flagstar we have a lot on our plate as you can imagine march came along unexpectedly from pretty much everybody and we were able to be accommodative and work with the government to facilitate what we believe a very good transaction were busy right we want to get our conversions done we got to get our systems in order we have a lot of integration that we want to make sure we prioritize so i will tell you that were very pleased where we are and were building new flagstar and its unlikely that well be participating in growth opportunities and the companys gone from billion to 120ish billion and thats a lot of growth and we have a lot of work to do in front of us and the team is indiscernible with reggie ph davis and eric and all the great team members we have here were busy so we have the priority of getting us to be that billion institution where we feel very proud of the back office the system conversion a lot of work ahead of us mark new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 mark fitzgibbon q analyst piper sandler co youre saying thats the priority thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and thats the priority operator your next question comes from the line of brody preston with ubs please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc morning brody brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning hey i just wanted to follow up on those two office credits i wanted to ask what was the ltv on those loans prior to the reappraisal john and where did the ltv go on reappraisal prior to you charging them down thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well let me defer to john adams hes actually in my office so john do you want to just address those two credits john t adams a directorindirect multifamily lending senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc good morning both f those credits at the time of origination were or less they were originated quite some time before the pandemic the impact of the pandemic and obviously leasing activity and vacancies both of those credits at the time that we reappraised obviously syracuse was more than but the larger asset in the city brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you for that and thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc syracuse had a significant tenant this was a unique iconic building that blessed its major tenant and well deal it as we go along here we were very active to get the appraisal up there we took a much lower valuation and well work through the workout process feel good about the fact that this is at a level that we can move this we will be happy but well work with the existing borrower to see if he wants to try to work through the bank if not we will have people that are willing to step in here new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and i just wanted to get a sense for you do you have an idea for what the lease roles look like for the rest of the office portfolio if it was a if it was a tenant leaving that kind of caused the issue with the syracuse portfolio just wanted to get a sense for what those lease roles look like thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sorry this is tom again i would say big picture we know were going through that process we talked about manhattan we have about ph billion at the trump billion in manhattan very cognizant of whats coming due when it comes to refinancing and respect the coupons as well as the tenancy we evaluate that feel pretty good about the portfolio but this is a an environment where you have to have an enhanced monitoring the company is doing a lot of work to ensure that were getting updated financial statements this is that time of year from now until the end of the year we get a lot of new financial statements as john indicated we updated the macroeconomic backdrop towards the credit environment in particular cre but clearly this is a unique portfolio typically and historical basis it was a sponsordriven opportunity for the bank historically weve had a very strong mix a very strong family that actually buy into the multifamily and cre market opportunistically tied to the exchange opportunity when it comes to tax deferrals and we have a very strong overall average ltv and a strong debt service coverage ratio youre going to have oneoffs from time to time i will call this particular one a one up we dont see a trends yet but were monitoring it very carefully brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc okay and ill just ask one more and then hop out just a clarifying one on the average earning asset guide was that stable at million for the fourth quarter and if so could you clarify the moving parts there for me john just given the period end was quite a bit lower than that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so what were looking at is from an average perspective we expect that cash and securities will be pretty flat we dont expect significant declines in those two items now once again that depends of course on our success in bringing in deposits in the quarter and we do expect to have some loan growth nothing substantial but just a little bit of loan growth here which is why we think we can be pretty close to that i dont think like i mentioned were not going to see the big declines weve seen in the past therell still be a little bit of a mix shift between cash securities and loans we just dont expect it to be as big a drop as it was quarter over quarter its going to be relatively consistent thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i would just add to that point its tom again that strategically we put out a plan when we announced the receivership transaction and how we see the balance sheet coming in at year end now were focusing on the businesses and the businesses will have some businesses actually seeing declines in particular multifamily cre the business is very slow youll see the offset of growth in the ci portfolios were very very optimistic about the opportunity on overall interest rates when it comes to residential lending we have lee smith on the line he can expand upon the opportunity there its a much different market when it comes to resi lending so our new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 mortgage bank has been rightsized back in january so we actually are making money in the line of business which is not common in financial services in todays environment but clearly have other levers to pull and probably the augmentation of the balance sheet will continue youll see more of a shift away from cre and multifamily just because of the market theres not a lot of activity and our spreads about 300basis point spread off the 5year treasury and probably wider than where the government is and the government will be proactive with their balance sheet we will be less proactive and well be focusing on relationships for deposit gathering so like i indicated going back to the strategy its going to be about relationship banking and all the lines of businesses and weve seen some good pickup on homebuilder finance business good pick up on the ci business as far as really getting a seat at the table and getting deposit flows tied to the businesses that were banking on the corporate bank sponsorship side with that im going to pass the baton over to lee to get some update on mortgage and what we see the opportunity in respect to the mortgage market so lee smith lee matthew smith a senior executive vice president presidentmortgage new york community bancorp inc yeah sure thanks tom i think theres a number of opportunities i think first of all just from an origination point of view if you look at q3 versus q2 the market was down quarteroverquarter and our mock mortgage locks were down only and we actually saw gain on sale margin expansion of about basis points or quarter overquarter and i think weve benefited from dislocation in the market certainly in the tpo channels weve seen a major player exit weve seen others exit weve been able to bring in some very strong accounts executives weve brought in some new clients and were getting a greater share of wallet from existing customers as well so weve benefited on the origination side to toms point weve rightsized our operation from an infrastructure point of view weve taken about of our infrastructure cost out from the high of and the mortgage origination business which includes the return on msr is profitable and were very pleased about that in this environment that dislocation is also spreading to the warehouse lending business and so as i mentioned the market was down but average outstandings from a warehouse point of view were up million or and again as weve seen dislocation and people exiting that space weve been able to benefit from that as well and then i think finally and tom has talked about deposits when you look at the mortgage vertical and you look at all the various ways that were plugged in to the mortgage ecosystem from an origination a servicing a lending point of view and then youve got the cash and treasury management team that we acquired as part of the signature acquisition weve got somewhere between billion and billion of deposits that are coming from that mortgage vertical theres about billion coming from the servicing or subservicing business and all the loans on the servicing platform and then theres another million to billion billion from that team that came over from signature some of those are escrow deposits and so those balances typically move between ph billion and billion but this billion to billion of deposits on the balance sheet that are coming from that mortgage vertical and the ecosystem that were working with day in day out and we think we can attract more deposits over time from that ecosystem new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i want to add ph in lease business is clearly the opportunity that we look at the ph hybrid arm market right now we do have a tremendous opportunity as customers are looking away from the ph or 15year mark and focusing on a shorter duration opportunity which really is underwriting a very low ltv is an opportunity for this bank to look at balance sheet opportunities and look at an asset class were very comfortable with ph on putting on given the changes in interest rates which will also be a potential for organic growth for the company especially tied to the opportunity with some of our new team members that have joined us and focus on that business brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you very much for the thorough answer i appreciate it thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator your next question comes from the line of manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning so you spoke about nim stepping down from to about and the majority of the custodial deposits going away and earning assets being relatively flat so it sounds like nii of roughly a little bit over million or so next quarter is what youre guiding to so a do i have that right and b i think more broadly how are you thinking about the run rate for net interest income for next year is that million plus number a good starting point from which you can grow through thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start and ill pass the baton to john our cfo i will tell you big picture it seems like weve got to a lot faster than i expected from the transaction and the overall margin so obviously were still asset sensitive were pleased on the results thus far regarding the future guidance we dont have future guidance out there in the marketplace but we are very optimistic with the diversification in our asset mix were not that same bank that we were a year ago when it comes to legacy thrift models we have diversification that has a lot of floating rate coupons tied to higher spreads we have unique businesses tied to the ci marketplace we have as we indicated indiscernible business that has an opportunity on a hybrid arm book of business as well so when you look at future asset growth its going to be diversification within the portfolio and rates have significantly increased just to give you some data points on the cre multifamily portfolio we have billion coming due over the next months next year alone its about billion multifamily coupon at coming due and cre at you new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 bring that to the market thats a powerful benefit for the asset yield that goes consistently between billion to billion each year that we know is coming due and well deal with it as they come due now all those loans are not going to stay with the bank its going back to our focus its going to be relationship banking and if the government steps in the government can gladly step in for customers who dont want to have deposits but the reality is were going to focus on making sure that customers get to the other side and were going to work with our customers very carefully on the relationship banking side and theres no relationship were really not interested in partnering with just loan activity that are coming off coupons that are well below the market so we have an opportunity to really price up that portfolio and growth is not going to drive profitability in that book now the other lines of businesses can grow very very favorably here given the current spreads that were seeing in all lines of business and banking spreads have changed dramatically across the financial services spectrum since march as i indicated were basis points better were not moving on that it would have been very proactive to have strong economic spread on the multifamily cre side but ph all spreads throughout all lines of business have clearly upped quite a bit given the interest rate environment so with that being said ill pass the baton to john to add more color on john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah just quickly on the fourth quarter were not going to see declines in the spot balances that weve seen right on interest earning assets or on total assets so total assets is about million im sorry billion that were not going to see the continued drops in that that weve seen quarter in the last couple of quarters due to pay down on the cash the average will still be down just not down as much as it was when you look at q2 to q3 is our expectation so its not going to be exactly the we just believe that the rate of change on the average is starting to decline as were hitting our spot balances here we dont think well drop much lower than this this billion that we were as of so thats the only piece i want to make sure that i clarify thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc now the one other point i would say were really focusing on creating this institution that were going to be agnostic to changes of interest rates we really want to get away from being so significantly asset sensitive and reliability sensitive we were on the legacy thrift model that was our achilles heel we had a significant history of liability sensitivity were moving towards as john indicated neutrality was still asset sensitive and its rising rate environment current rate environment that will add to continued margin benefits but ultimately rates go up or down we want to have a very strong margin as we run these businesses through changes of interest rate thats the focus to build this institution going forward under the new flagstar manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc thats helpful and just a clarification that the loans that are coming due over the next year the yield pickup on those loans would be basis points to basis points or so thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 i mean right now theyre multifamily books for next year to ph coming due and its cre so market is what right now about ph of the five years is probably close to close to ph difference so thats a pretty big difference we have different product mix which were proud that were offering to our customers to work with them we have a structure thats synthetic that kind of mimics whats being done in the government market which is a new product to the bank we have the sofr option on repricing which has been very positive for their refinancing opportunities and theyll choose when they want to ph lock in long most of our customers feel that in the years ahead therell be lower rates so theyre waiting on the sidelines paying a much higher interest rate today the ones that are staying with us and the ones that are going away are typically going to the government manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then just another question on expenses it looks like there is high expenses associated with the flagstar conversion and signature loan to your servicing that will come out at some point in the next year can you size the expense benefits that come from that john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah were going to provide our full guide at our next at our conference call in january but as we mentioned weve seen both headwinds and tailwinds for when compared to and those systems integrations will provide us the benefit and some cost reductions as well as depending on what happens with the rest of the fdic receivership loans the multifamily and the cre loans if those do end up transferring to a purchaser in this fourth quarter then well have some benefits also on the cost side from that extra servicing that we no longer have manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc great thank you john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc indiscernible operator your next question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning casey casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks yeah good morning everyone so ill start to beat a dead horse but i do want to another followup on the nim so if im understanding this correctly you expect cash to be flat but you still have billion new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 of custody deposits that are going to run out in the near term here so what is that so how are you going to fund that given that dda ex the custody was still down billion so is that cd brokered deposits john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so we casey haire q analyst jefferies llc sorry go ahead john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah so we yeah correct we expect cash and securities when you look at them combined to be relatively flat depending on the changes in the balance sheet right we are hoping to bring in deposits from multiple teams is what reggie was speaking about and ph eric on both the consumer and the private banking side so any shortfall we can make up with either in the brokered cd market or in the wholesale borrowing market just to ensure that we have the appropriate liquidity on the balance sheet for each quarter that we go through this process so we just we dont expect significant changes and significant drops from the periodend balance but we will take a look and see what market conditions provide and how our deposit growth comes in in the fourth quarter casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay i mean its thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc casey this is tom ph just on that point when you think about where we came out of march we were in a different position right we had a lot of liquidity we had the ability to take a step back we werent chasing deposits werent chasing rates the industry has so weve been very proactive on paying down brokered deposits across brokers also highcost borrowing that came due as a strategy to get to thats the public strategy from the receivership transaction going forward its going to go back to an organic strategy focusing on deposit initiatives on all of our lines of businesses casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay understood and then just one more on expenses the guide for implies a pretty wide range of anywhere from ph million to million in the fourth quarter i mean i think most of us expect kind of a flat number but your guide does allow for some upward expense pressure in the fourth quarter just wondering what would drive that another million or so john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 yeah i would think that given where we came out in the third quarter the third quarter had higher expenses compared to the second quarter i wouldnt expect the run rate to be above that so that would fall ph as right really close to the middle of the guide and i think theres opportunities to do slightly better than that in the fourth quarter as well to get to more than mid to the low end of that guide so yes the guide for the year when you only have a quarter left i understand that its pretty wide but i would focus on the midpoint of the guide casey haire q analyst jefferies llc thank you operator your next question comes from the line of matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matthew breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning a good morning matthew breese q analyst stephens inc tom i was hoping you could touch on the wholesale borrowings coming due in the fourth quarter i think they had a near rate whats the anticipated strategy with those as they assumedly get calls thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill pass that to john john john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah including the puts that we have its billion at for the rest of this quarter given where the portables are of that amount its about billion in portables we expect they will be put so that billion we would expect to refi unless we have deposit growth to pay them off we would expect to refi them in the market as we go forward here or like i said if we have deposit growth well pay them off matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and similar to the signature custody deposits running off we should not really anticipate that much movement in cash balances from to it feels like the billion level is where you want to keep cash for now new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah when you look at i would look at the cash and the securities together but i think thats right around billion makes sense depending on the level of deposit growth what we are seeing the type of deposits that come in we want to make sure that we stay liquid from an on balance sheet perspective with cash and security so ph kind of i think around billion makes sense on the cash side depending on where our securities end up matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay and then just to clear up the prior discussion around average earning asset balances for the fourth quarter it sounds like maybe they will trend lower just not at the same page we just saw is that an accurate statement john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc right thats right the spot balances are not going to move dramatically from the million but the average will still trend down its just the rate of change is starting to slow right matthew breese q analyst stephens inc and when do you expect to start to see average earning asset growth again john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc i think once we get through the fourth quarter and these the custodial deposits are the biggest driver of this right i mean we went from billion at the end of june to billion now and then we have after that once we get to december were going to be very low in that number so i think once we hit our december periodend balances which will not be too dramatically different we dont believe to the piece then well start to see the average start to stabilize and start to grow depending on loan growth once you get into the first quarter of matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay just going back to credit beyond the office loans within the release it showed that multifamily loans i think npas there are up to million just been steadily increasing i was hoping you could talk about your broader multifamily portfolio how much is rent regulated i think in the past its been billion of which billion are for buildings where units rent regulated units are north of starting to see any sort of cracks there it just feels like theres a pileup of issues from the rent ph loss thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc now let me start off and im going to pass the baton to john adams who runs that portfolio the reality is that the its oneoff families indiscernible maybe one or two families that ones going through a marital dispute thats going through the court system and theres a handful of those credits tied to a relationship its a handful of relationships its not systemic its not something were seeing yet new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 so were clearly monitoring rates are dramatically higher and our customers ph dont have the capacity to deal with the sofr option and with fixed rate option tied to a derivative option that we offer to them so its been proactive and if they want to go for longterm financing and they want to go to the government the government is open for business and most banks have widened their spreads given the economic backdrop ph of what were seeing in credit spreads so its been a relatively strong book like i said a very powerful position regarding the consistency of performance were not seeing trends with that ill pass over to john to give some color john john t adams a directorindirect multifamily lending senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc thanks tom yes exactly what tom said some of those instances theyre really more familyrelated issues and not really the performance of the assets themselves there are some instances where a lot of the issues from them not being able to pay timely because the tenants arent paying and those are typically in the more working class neighborhoods in the rent regulated properties that they know the system they know how to drag on an eviction process so its not really rapid and for the rest of the portfolio outside of those isolated instances the market rents like tom mentioned earlier are up i think month over month and you just cant kill the new york multifamily market so were monitoring the rent regulated properties closely but theres not really a lot of cracks in that particular portfolio that is really raising anything for us to have any real concern over it right at this time matthew breese q analyst stephens inc okay the followup question there is signatures commercial real estate multifamily and then rentregulated multifamily portfolio is being bid out and some of the news articles out there are citing this as a more difficult portfolio to sell when it sells if it sells and depending on the price does this come into play for your balance sheet in any way shape or form does it impact the level three asset pricing and your estimated fair value of your own loan portfolio thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc so let me give you my big picture thoughts on that right we are cash flow lender ph for deeply discounted rental indiscernible weve been doing this for long time we are not marktomarket i cant comment specifically on whats going to happen for the unknown on the portfolio but ultimately my guess is that the assets will trade i think it will be a little bit more complicated given the rent regulated nuance to a portion of that portfolio in my view thats something thats got interesting views in respect to the ongoing landlords and the tenants and happy relationship going forward whoever buys that portfolio thats something that thats a nuance that we havent seen before we havent seen such a large transaction in the market but the nonrent regulated portfolio will trade at a clearing price depending on interest rate and credit marks and i dont believe in my opinion its going to impact marktomarket in respect to institution thats been putting on the portfolio going to maturity and the ability to hold that portfolio as a cash flow lender and as far as clearing prices at the end of the day theres not a lot of trades going on theres not a lot of activity for buying and selling these assets will go through the market eventually and well deal with the outcome of their activity and therell be probably some smart individual investors that will probably do financially well like pricing it accordingly it gets a new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 little bit more complicated on the rent regulated portfolio just because of the community ties and the nuances between landlord and tenant relationships weve done a tremendous job on really managing that process as a community institution focusing on working with the landlords working with the tenant community groups and being part of that ph ambassador in between that a new player coming in doesnt have that culture that history so making it challenging so that seems a little bit complicated but at the end of the day my view is the assets will trade eventually and well move on from that i dont call it a marktomarket per se if youre a cash flow lender and we are a discounted cash flow lender given that rentregulated portfolio thats traditionally significantly below traditional market ph record matthew breese q analyst stephens inc got it okay just last one for me more broadly what is the size of your overall syndicated loan portfolio and maybe just give some color on the credit metrics behind it thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc reggie do you want to hit that or if not we can probably get back to matt on that one reggie do you have any color there reginald e davis a senior executive vice president presidentconsumer corporate banking new york community bancorp inc yeah i dont have that exact number at my fingertips but we can get it thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc indiscernible matthew breese q analyst stephens inc great ill leave it there thank you everybody thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc just one point to that we are building a corporate bank sponsorship division that actually participates on originating and selling to the syndicate market generating the opportunity for fees for the bank going forward with more of a commercial bank ph flair to that using the derivative marketplaces so clearly moving towards that commercial bank mentality not just making a loan and holding loan but making a loan and holding a piece of the loan but selling a large amount of the exposure off to the secondary market so thats going to be the strategy as we build up the commercial bank model reginald e davis a senior executive vice president presidentconsumer corporate banking new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 yeah tom let me just let me i think thats an important point when you ask about the size of the syndicated book we use syndications primarily to sell down positions were not out buying participations for the most part that is primarily an offensive play for us and allows us to participate to a larger extent with our most important clients and still keep our relative exposure low thats how we use that function thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc thats right operator your next question will come from the line of david smith with autonomous research please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp good morning appreciate the clarification on the earning asset outlook i think a lot of us were confused that getting to flattish on average mark when the spot balance is more around one or two but it sounds like youre just saying that the decline will be smaller than the billion that we saw on average assets from to so something above billion or billion presumably for the fourth quarter john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah yeah what were talking about is the actual start with the spot balance we dont anticipate to be dramatically smaller a lot of the pay downs have already occurred as i mentioned at the last question cash around billion give or take where securities ph end so the drop in cash is the significant drop in cash has basically stopped here so this is about where well be so the average will continue to decline as it catches up to the spot balance and then once were once thats been pretty consistent which we believe will start in the fourth quarter then hopefully we can see some of the average balances start to grow after that david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp okay got it and then beyond the bulk of the remaining billion of custodial deposits running off presumably in a week or so as you said i appreciate that youre expecting and planning for some deposit growth across the businesses but anything else you can keep in mind in terms of seasonality of deposits or anything like that that might help influence the average balance in the fourth quarter compared to the spot balance thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc no i dont nothing specific on my side reggie anything you could think of from the seasonality perspective reginald e davis a senior executive vice president presidentconsumer corporate banking new york community bancorp inc new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 no theres really not a seasonality theres some movement within the month but basically any seasonality would relate to production theres a little bit of seasonality in that but that doesnt really affect the overall balances in the book so no david smith q analyst autonomous research us lp all right thank you appreciate the color thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc sure operator our next question will come from the line of steve moss with raymond james please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning steve steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning following up on the multifamily lending and commercial real estate just given where pricing is these days curious where debt service coverage ratios are shaping out whether its on a renewal or a reset and if youre seeing any borrowers who are having to put up additional cash to support the property thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc ill start the response and then ill defer to john adams but i will tell you that its been relatively strong given many of the customers are able to look at their options and their option is a sofr option or a fixed rate option and we work with them and have the capacity to continue to pay the ones that are looking to get more dollars i think its ph far too between is that fair john indiscernible john t adams a directorindirect multifamily lending senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc yes thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc and the reality is that when they do have significant equity and theyre looking for locking in ph loan which a lot of them are theyre not looking to ph lock in loan they really believe rates will be lower in the future theyre choosing to roll to the higher coupon in the market and when they do go to the refinancing market its us and or the agency market as being the opportunity and like i indicated were focusing on relationship deposit banking so its going to have compensating balances which is going to be critical for our business model going forward and more importantly if theres equity there and theyre looking at economic spreads theyre much wider and the governments probably slightly tighter than us and thats an option to go along but a lot of customers are waiting new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 this out thinking that in or is when theyre going to make that longer term decision so maybe john do you want to add some color john t adams a directorindirect multifamily lending senior executive vice president new york community bancorp inc and ill just add to that but yes of course if theyre just repricing and theyre leaving a threehandle fourhandle coupon and today its seven plus sure the debt service coverage isnt where it was typically when the loan was originated but theres still enough coverage for them to meet all their obligations operating as well as debt service and obviously we tracked that on an annual basis and if they are less than what we would expect they get risk graded accordingly and they get reserved the way that they should be based on our model so something that we do definitely keep an eye on but in answer to your question if theres not enough to refinance out yeah the debt service coverages have come down but not to the point where they cant meet their obligations thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc i would say we havent seen many customers that had to write a check to do a refinancing yes but rates are much higher than they were a year ago and as the customers come to us our goal here is to get them to the other side its a difficult environment coming from a much lower rate lets say the mid to now lets say mid to almost on a fixed rate now you can probably do something floating somewhere in indiscernible basis points basis points below that and governments indiscernible will be basis points inside of that so were being proactive to get the customer to the other side given the challenges because of the significant changes of interest rates steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then on the office portfolio just curious here john you mentioned a qualitative factor for office curious whats the reserve allocated to that portfolio just given the mix of criticized and classified john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah we dont split it out specifically but it is something that has been growing especially given the million provision that we booked this quarter but like we talked about before prior to this quarter the performance has been extremely strong so we continue to look at that we continue to look at the sdrs and the ltvs and the portfolio as well as well as the deep dive weve been doing into the underlying leases in the portfolio so were comfortable with where we are right now but we did start to see a bit of a build an allowance build here this quarter steve moss q analyst raymond james associates inc okay great thank you very much operator your next question comes from the line of peter winter with d a davidson please go ahead new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning peter peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co good morning good morning tom will you guys have to go through the formal ph dfas exam next year im just wondering if you can quantify the expense component that needs to be realized as part of a ph dfas bank thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc well let me just start off and im going to pass that to john we are going to go through a always go through a capital planning process and weve been doing ph dfas process prior to the change in the limit when billion became much higher with that being said we will go through that process i believe well go through that process in early and i dont believe its a public process but its going to go through the process and were preparing for that john if you want to john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc yeah thats right i mean we will continue to do what we have been doing and since we started building to get ready for the old billion threshold back in with preparing a capital plan submitting a capital plan going through the process we have a significant stress testing group that weve put in place a long time ago and have added two to be ready for the plan to be ready to be over billion so yes well be performing those well be performing that process in and then well probably be part of the next cycle when it comes to the public process that tom was mentioning peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co got it okay thanks and then can you just talk about maybe the outlook for provision expense when i look at the acl ratio it increased a little bit to but do you need to keep adding to reserves just given the change to the composition of the loan portfolio john j pinto a senior executive vice president chief financial officer new york community bancorp inc well theres no doubt that the loan portfolio composition has changed and were a much more diversified lender now than we have been and that ratio has consistently gone up since the acquisitions of both flagstar and signature but what it really comes down to under cecl is the macroeconomic factors and the performance of the portfolio so depending on what the trend is here in those macroeconomic factors we have seen them decline but relatively stable decline in those types of factors but if depending on how that comes out and depending on the growth in the portfolios we could see the provisions move around a little bit here but it really depends on those macroeconomic factors and what were seeing in the individual portfolios peter j winter q analyst d a davidson co okay got it thanks very much new york community bancorp inc nycb corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2023 operator your next question comes from the line of christopher marinac with janney montgomery scott please go ahead thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc good morning chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey thanks good morning hey thanks for taking all of our questions tom just a quick one about the enforcement of kind of new loan new deposits with new loans can you write in your contracts higher interest rates if the compensating balances go below certain threshold is that something that you can do in this era thomas robert cangemi a president chief executive officer director new york community bancorp inc no what we have on our agreements we do have a requirements to have operating accounts and theres no question during the pandemic it was critical and it really gave us some good guidance on where the cash flows are coming in given the unknown of the pandemic we carried into that into our ph docs that we have an expectation of an operating account regarding the cash flow of the in particular the properties that we have to make sure that the cash flow is coming in but i think the reality is that we have longstanding relationships we are going to prioritize the capital allocation towards relationship banking in all businesses and i think thats how were going to be successful there was a significant shift about three years ago and its been very proactive on cagr roles of significance when it comes to the multifamily cre portfolio and i would say as far as what we saw running out of the bank is maybe the will understand that we want to ensure that we have a strong depositor relationship and as we move forward itll be more towards this expectation of compensating balances in certain many in many instances thats also tied to lines of credit and were really working with the client to really ensure that we are a bank partnership we expect reciprocation when it comes to the business opportunity if it doesnt happen were very glad to allocate that capital to other lines of businesses and we have other avenues where historically we did not christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great tom thats great clarity thank you very much again for all the information this morning operator our final question will come from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw please
