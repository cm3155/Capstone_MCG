rhode island thanks kristin and good morning everyone thanks for joining our call today there was a lot going on in q2 with the focus on closing the investors acquisition and commencing our new york city metro integration efforts in addition the feds move to rein in inflation through higher short rates and quantitative tightening put a spotlight on a joint management of our capital liquidity and funding position as well as our interest rate management the good news is that weve made strong progress on all fronts while posting very good financial results our underlying eps for the quarter was thats up from the first quarter and rotce was positive sequential operating leverage was on an underlying basis and thats excluding the impact of acquisitions our ppnr growth was driving these strong results was a significant sequential jump in net interest income of thats ex acquisitions as spot loan growth reached which is ex acquisitions and our net interest margin jumped basis points we are seeing a strong pickup in line utilization in commercial which has afforded us the opportunity to be more selective in lowerreturning consumer portfolios like mortgage and auto our deposit performance was good as periodend deposits ex acquisitions were up citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 our fees were relatively resilient up ex acquisitions given the diversity of our fee revenue streams higher volatility kept capital markets in check though it benefited fx and derivative product revenue which hit an alltime high wealth continued to grow nicely in the quarter while mortgage revenue was up slightly we did our usual fine job on expenses and credit performance continues to be excellent we continue to see favorable trends in key credit metrics on both the commercial and consumer side at this point we feel the second half should hold up well with only a gradual normalization in loss rates given the solid positioning of our customers today we currently expect our solid momentum to continue into the second half of we will continue to benefit from rate rises our fees should remain resilient and we will benefit on expenses from our acquisition synergies and the top program we project positive operating leverage in q3 and q4 with rotce moving beyond our to target range the market seems concerned about the rising possibility of a recession in and the potential for much higher credit cross at this point we see slower economic growth as the base assumption for and if there is a recession we believe it should be shallow and short lived we are being highly selective on new loan originations and weve moved several portfolios to held for sale largely from investors to optimize our balance sheet position we continue to believe our credit performance will be good on a relative basis should a downturn come its an exciting time for citizens we have many promising initiatives in flight that we are managing well we are focusing on areas where we can leverage our strengths and where we have a right to win the current environment gives us a great opportunity to prove our mettle and deliver prudent sustainable growth we certainly feel up to the challenge with that let me turn it over to john to cover the financials in more detail john john f woods vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island thanks bruce good morning everyone first ill start with our headlines for the quarter referencing slides and we reported underlying net income of million and eps of our underlying rotce for the quarter was net interest income was up linked quarter driven by a 29basispoint improvement in margin and strong loan growth including the impact of the hsbc and isbc transactions periodend loans are up linked quarter excluding loans added by the hsbc and isbc transactions loan growth was a strong led by commercial growth of average loans are up linked quarter excluding acquisitions average loans were up with growth in commercial underlying fees were up linked quarter or excluding hsbc and isbc acquisition impacts reflecting the diversity and resiliency of our fee businesses our client hedging business had another exceptional quarter and we delivered record results in wealth and card mortgage fees were up slightly and capital markets fees were down a bit given continued market volatility we remained disciplined on expenses which were up linked quarter excluding the hsbc and isbc transactions overall we delivered underlying positive operating leverage of linked quarter and that was excluding the hsbc and isbc transactions our underlying efficiency ratio improved to citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 we recorded an underlying provision for credit losses excluding isbc of million which reflects continued strong credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios the underlying credit provision for the quarter excludes million for the double count of cecl provision expense tied to the isbc transaction our acl ratio stands at down from at the end of the first quarter our tangible book value per share was down linked quarter driven primarily by the impact of rising rates on securities and hedged valuations that impact aoci we continue to have very strong capital position with cet1 at and we have increased our common dividend by to a share on slide we have provided the hsbc and isbc contributions to our second quarter results as well as the notable items for the quarter also slide in the appendix provides a summary of the purchase accounting impacts associated with the isbc transaction next ill provide some key takeaways for our second quarter results on slide net interest income was up given higher net interest margin and growth in interestearning assets including the impacts of the hsbc and isbc transactions the net interest margin is up basis points which as you can see on the nim walk in the bottom lefthand side of the slide shows the benefit of higher rates with a 24basispoint increase related to asset yields reflecting the asset sensitivity of our balance sheet and improved securities reinvestment rates there is an 11basispoint benefit from hsbc and isbc transactions largely given the repositioning of the isbc securities portfolio and the benefit of adding their loans with rising rates funding costs reduced the margin basis points reflecting wellcontrolled deposit costs earning asset yields are up basis points linked quarter strongly outpacing our interestbearing deposit costs which are up only basis points moving to slide given the feds recent rate hikes and the current market expectations for the fed funds rate to end the year in the to basis points range we are confident that we will continue to realize meaningful benefits from rising rates as the forward curve plays out our asset sensitivity has driven a significant improvement in nii in the first half of this year and those benefits will continue to accumulate in the second half of and compound into since the path of the rate cycle is uncertain on the topleft side of this page weve provided an estimate of our nii sensitivity to further changes in rates either up or down from the june forward curve our overall asset sensitivity stands at about at the end of the second quarter this is down from for the first quarter reflecting the incorporation of isbcs nii base and liabilitysensitive profile as well as hedging actions taken to stabilize the margin and protect against downside interest rate risk our improved nii outlook as well as changes in the balance sheet also contribute to the reduction in asset sensitivity essentially a 25basis point instantaneous change in the forward curve is worth about million to million a quarter with that balance between the long and short parts of the curve we began the rate cycle with a strong liquidity profile deposits cost as low as they have ever been and our overall funding profile greatly improved including significant improvements to our deposit mix and capabilities we will continue to optimize our deposit base and to invest in our capabilities to attract durable customer deposits so far in this cycle with fed funds increasing basis points since the fourth quarter of we are quite pleased with how our deposit franchise is performing with a cumulative beta of about on a sequential basis for the second quarter our beta was this puts us on track for a cumulative beta through the end of this rate cycle if the forward curve plays out as expected citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 moving onto slide we posted solid results demonstrating the strength and diversity of our fee businesses capital markets delivered solid results despite continued market volatility impacting the bonds and equity markets we saw ma advisory and equity underwriting fees picking up a bit but these were more than offset by modestly lower loan syndication revenue we continue to see good strength in our pipelines and capital market fees could rebound nicely in the second half of the year if markets settle down and there is more certainty regarding the path of the economy we once again delivered a record performance in our client hedging business up million linked quarter driven primarily by fx as we help clients manage their currency exposures as the dollar strengthened during the quarter our interest rate and commodities businesses also performed very well but were down modestly from record levels in the first quarter mortgage fees were up modestly linked quarter given improved servicing income as higher mortgage rates resulted in slower amortization of the msr production fees remained under pressure given lower industry origination volume with rising rates and seasonal impacts strong competition continues to pressure margins however there are clear signs that the industry is beginning to reduce capacity which should benefit margins as we head into the second half of the year we delivered record wealth fees up linked quarter as rising market interest rates supported customer flows into annuity products card fees were also a record given seasonally higher transaction volumes on slide expenses were wellcontrolled up linked quarter excluding hsbc and isbc our top efficiency program is continuing to make good progress on track to deliver million of pretax run rate benefits by the end of the year periodend loans on slide were up linked quarter primarily driven by the impact of the isbc transaction which closed at the beginning of the quarter excluding the impact of the hsbc and isbc transactions loan growth was with strong commercial loan growth again this quarter up led by ci as we emphasize strong relationships to optimize risk adjusted returns retail loans were up as we continue to be more selective in consumer lending average loans were up linked quarter or excluding the impact of the hsbc and isbc transactions with growth in commercial led by ci and growth in retail in commercial we continue to see strength in corporate banking originations across every region line utilization continued to rebound with an increase of about basis points to on a spot basis primarily driven by corporate banking with the largest quarterly increase in utilization we have seen since early in the pandemic our clients are continuing to use their lines to build inventories to get ahead of supply chain issues and rising input prices and some are also looking to pro rata bank financing as an alternative to the volatile bond markets concurrent with the isbc acquisition we identified certain nonstrategic loan portfolios totaling billion which we are in the process of being marketed for sale these loans were classified as up for sale at quarter end this will free up capital and enable our relationship bankers to focus on more desirable commercial relationship business in new york metro on slide our periodend deposits were up linked quarter as we added billion of deposits from the isbc transaction excluding isbc and hsbc periodend deposits were up slightly while average deposits were down slightly reflecting seasonal runoff and a decline in commercial surge deposits moving on to slide we saw excellent credit results again this quarter across the retail and commercial portfolios net charge offs were at basis points down basis points linked quarter nonperforming loans fell citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 basis points to basis points of total loans linked quarter driven by improvements in ci residential real estate and home equity other credit metrics continue to look excellent across the retail and commercial portfolios and criticized loans as a percentage of the commercial portfolio are stable after incorporating isbc but down on a standalone basis on slide ill walk through the drivers of the allowance this quarter we continue to see excellent credit performance across the retail and commercial portfolios we added to the reserve this quarter to take into account strong commercial loan growth as well as the addition of isbc while we arent seeing any signs of early stress in the portfolio at this point our allowance takes into account the expectation of a more challenging macroeconomic outlook given the feds rate actions to combat inflation our overall coverage ratio was which is a modest decline from the first quarter reflecting the strong performance of our retail portfolio and the addition of the isbcs cre portfolio which includes a sizable multifamily component with lower reserve requirements than our legacy portfolios if you recall when we adopted cecl at the beginning of our coverage ratio was to put our current coverage ratio in context we estimate our pro forma coverage ratio would be slightly lower than the level today if we applied our current portfolio mix incorporating isbc to our day cecl approach importantly our coverage of nonaccrual loans strengthened to up from in the first quarter we feel good about the improvements to the loan portfolio weve made over the past few years and the overall positioning of our credit risk moving to slide we maintain excellent balance sheet strength our cet1 ratio remained strong at following the release of the feds dfast stress results last month our board increased our common share repurchase authorization to billion and today we announced an increase in our common dividend to a share our fundamental priorities for deploying capital have not changed and you can expect us to remain extremely disciplined in how we manage the company shifting gears a bit on slide youll see some examples of the progress we made against the key strategic initiatives and other work we are doing across the bank to better serve our customers and make citizens a great place to work as you know we closed the acquisition of isbc at the beginning of april and we are very focused on a successful integration i am proud of the work our teams have done related to the acquisition we onboarded more than new colleagues through our hr systems on day and in the second quarter we began originating mortgages on our systems we have a number of conversions planned over the remainder of the year and we are on track to finish in the first quarter of we have included a highlevel integration timeline in the appendix on slide importantly we are on target to achieve the million in run rate net expense synergies by the end of of which approximately will be achieved by yearend the total represents about of isbcs expense base also isbc integration costs to be incurred through are now expected to come in below the estimated level at deal announcement we recently released our fifth annual corporate responsibility report which highlights our progress on esg initiatives the report highlights a number of significant milestones related to our sustainability efforts including our progress towards targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions we also announced that weve joined the partnership for carbon accounting financials which will accelerate our efforts to measure and disclose finance emissions citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 later this year well release our first tcfd climate report which will describe our climate strategy in more detail the report also describes our commitment to the communities we serve and there are a few recent examples here on the slide with some of the community partnerships we are engaged with in boston and most recently in chinatown and queens new york on the consumer side we are excited about continuing our expansion in florida with the opening of our latest wealth center in naples we recently released a mobile app version of citizens access which we think will be very popular with our customers and we are very proud that our citizens pay pointofsale offering was awarded best innovation by the banking tech awards lastly our relentless focus on customer service driving results as our atm channel moved up eight places in the jd power rankings on the commercial side we continue to perform well in the league tables consistently ranking in the top as a middle market and sponsor book runner the diversification in our business model is delivering results with record revenue in our client fx hedging business we also closed the dh capital acquisition this quarter strengthening our capabilities in the internet infrastructure software and nextgeneration it services and communications sectors on the right side of the page weve included some digital metrics mobile active users are up over yearover year digital deposits and zelle transactions are up over and we are seeing great success with the customer uptake of automated client service through virtual chat sessions we are very excited with how our digitalfirst approach is increasing engagement with our customers and how this is all translating into a better experience and higher satisfaction moving to slide ill walk through the outlook for the third quarter since we closed isbc at the beginning of the second quarter our third quarter outlook includes all our recent acquisitions we expect nii to be up to driven by the benefit of higher rates and solid loan growth we are very focused on optimizing capital deployment in consumer we will reduce originations in mortgage auto and education refi while seeking to grow at home equity inschool education and citizens pay and card in commercial we expect to see further increases in line utilization but well be mindful of balancing growth and returns given current macro uncertainty these are expected to be broadly stable so upside exists if capital markets stabilize noninterest expense is expected to be up approximately we expect to continue strong sequential positive operating leverage in the third quarter and rotce above our medium target range of to net charge offs are expected to be approximately basis points we expect our cet1 ratio to land around the midpoint of our operating range at and our tax rate should come in a bit lower at approximately with respect to full year results we expect ppnr to be in line with our april guidance from a revenue standpoint we are seeing higher nii given net interest margin reaching approximately in the fourth quarter driven by higher rates and loan growth within our to guidance range this will be offset by lower fee revenue largely in capital markets and mortgage expenses will be well controlled which will result in full year operating leverage of at least basis points and a fourth quarter efficiency ratio of sub we also expect the net chargeoff ratio to come in lower than we guided in april given continued favorable trends to sum up on slide this was a very solid quarter and we are optimistic about the outlook for the rest of and beyond we are off to a running start in new york with the close of our two acquisitions there and we expect significant benefits in our net interest income from the higher rate environment and strong commercial loan citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 growth the strength and diversity of our fee business is driving solid results and our capital markets business in particular is well positioned for when markets stabilize given strong pipeline we will continue to focus on executing against our strategic priorities and building a topperforming bank that delivers for all our stakeholders with that ill hand it back over to bruce bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island okay thank you john operator lets open it up for qa question and answer section operator thank you mr van saun we are now ready for the qa portion of the call operator instructions your first question will come from the line of john pancari with evercore go ahead please john pancari q analyst evercore isi good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi there john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning john pancari q analyst evercore isi just on the loan front i guess its also a credit question i know you indicated that youre being more selective in select areas of consumer lending could you maybe give some color there in terms of what areas are you becoming more selective what youre seeing thats making you become more selective or is it just actually the broader backdrop and what that could mean for growth in the consumer portfolios thanks bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well let me start and ill go to brendan and john im sure you might want to chime in but i think we have the potential to continue to grow in consumer maybe at a faster pace than would be ideal in the current environment so were seeing a lot of growth right now on the commercial side line utilization picking up and i think in light of the environment that were seeing out there and transitioning in the investors balance sheet just making sure were focusing on allocation of capital to the highest invest uses and not putting a strain on deposit growth as were going through this higher rate environment is the game plan at this point citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 so when we look into the consumer world clearly mortgages and auto are areas where weve seen a lot of growth over the past couple of years were going to basically put mortgage more on a stable path and start to reduce our originations in auto and those are really return calls its a return on capital call where we think we have opportunities to grow in areas that deliver better returns would be things like heloc like the inschool student and then also part in citizens pay so i think overall well still see some net modest growth but were going to take some pluses and some minuses here and really be focused on capital allocation so with that brendan you want to add to that brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i guess just strategically what id add is that i think this is a natural pivot point for the journey of our strategy at the early stages of our ipo everything was accretive for the most part and so weve really scaled up our business and i believe we have one of the most wellrun and diversified consumer lending franchises amongst our peer set for sure and as we enter this next phase of our journey capital allocation is king and were making some strategic pivots id also say this is not necessarily brand new news if you recall prior to covid we had already started signaling we were going to start to put auto as an example on a path to reduce and get back into tier levels for concentration and through covid we found some great vintages of returns in market disruption so the benefit of the diversity of our business model allowed us to flex up through covid and now were sort of returning to our original glide path down of auto given that the auto business is naturally in sort of steady state of lower return and less relationship focus and then to bruces point on mortgage weve been outgrowing the citizens balance sheet on mortgage growth for quite some time and so we would like for that to grow no faster than the rate of the bank just given where were at right now on interest rates and the long duration nature of that business and so really making sure were protecting our balance sheet for a long duration for real relationshipfocused lending and customers is key the other place were curtailing a bit is some fintech partnerships that weve had over the years that served us well and added operating leverage allowed us to invest back in the bank but being much more relationship focused and our capital allocation is king but were very excited as bruce pointed over a couple places of our franchise heloc being one where we believe were the number one originator in the us for heloc originations credit quality is extremely good as superprime as it gets fico or less cltvs and were poised to capitalize on that and the inschool student product as bruce pointed out is coming back strong as the effects of covid wear off a little bit on student enrollment and then citizens pay we do have aspirations for mediumterm growth in that product so i think were well positioned we can flex up were not taking down muscle mass just making some capital allocation decisions as we optimize the balance sheet bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i think we said a lot john anything to add john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 okay i think were good john pancari q analyst evercore isi all right thank you for that and then just separately on credit again just i know you had indicated in your outlook you do expect some economic slowing as you look into the rest of this year and into but also that your reserve does consider a degree of that how do you think about what you could potentially see that begin to build the reserve more meaningfully here and if that does take hold where do you think the reserve could traject over time what do you think is the fair level given your economic outlook bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island ill kick off and hand it quickly to john but one of the things we pointed out was that were about where the day reserve would have been had we incorporated investors into those numbers so this ratio its down from but if you look at the shifts in some of the asset composition were about at day and we have incorporated a moodys scenario that does have a gdp slowdown and a higher recession risk into that scenario so i would say absent meaningful change in outlook that we could probably hang around this neighborhood for a while so anyway that would be my top of the house for you but john for more details please john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah sure i mean i think thats right i mean i think that our base scenario this quarter really relies predominantly on a mild recession which would last into sort of into next year so i think were covering that part of it weve even layered in in certain aspects of the portfolio more severe recessions thats also built in to where we are and to bruces point the mix shift in our portfolio has been extremely positive over the last couple of years so when you fast forward from the first quarter of or the beginning of to here in the second quarter of our mix profile is just much better and so you can almost think about the fact that were sort of back to the beginning where we have some uncertainty and some negative scenarios priced in and without a significant deterioration in the macro as bruce indicated were lucky to be in this range as you get into the end of the year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and i think it makes sense if you just step back and think about the consumer is in really good shape still has a lot of liquidity companies have refashioned their business models coming out of covid theyre all in pretty good shape and contending with inflation and supply chain and trying to maintain the margins so historically if you have a good jump off point you go through a shallow recession bank charge off rates dont go up all that much so i think youd have to see a meaningful change in outlook for us to come off that view john pancari q analyst evercore isi got it all right thanks bruce thanks john operator your next question will come from scott siefers with piper sandler go ahead please citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co morning guys bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co thank you for taking the question maybe just some additional thoughts on how you see deposit cost pressures playing out i think we can get a pretty good sense from slide how you see the full year sort of trajecting and was glad to see it reiterate the through the cycle beta expectations but as we look through the remainder of the year where specifically do you see the pressures that get you to the to by year end and then maybe if you can flesh out your thinking on deposit cost dynamics once the feds stops raising rates bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah ill take that i mean i think best way to describe that i mean we articulated that our cumulative beta through the second quarter better than we expected so feeling good about where were starting off this rate cycle our outlook indicates a deposit beta getting into the to range by the end of the year which implies the sequential betas in the second half and quarters being around mid so thats how that math would play out so you got thats how that trajectory would work the drivers of that are predominantly on the commercial side of the business but as expected consumer and retail deposits are incredibly well performing and well behaved in terms of deposit betas and we expect that to continue throughout the rest of the year we have a little bit of room on the balance sheet for citizens access and all of that has been incorporated into our outlook for the to by the end of the year and for the approximate through the whole cycle deposit betas will continue to rise as you get into and thats the difference between the approximate and the to that were talking about and they tend to continue to rise when the fed stops assuming that the fed doesnt start easing immediately thereafter so the last cycle we had the fed ended the cycle the very next quarter we were easing and so that sort of clicked off the lag effect that you would typically see in deposits but if the fed stops and stays stands path then you would see deposit costs continue to rise for another quarter or two after the last fed hike but i should hasten to add that theres the loan beta side to this equation and the loan beta side of it is loan betas basically are rising and they will continue to rise into the fed tightening cycle and even after the fed stops and in particular all the tailwind from some of the term fixed lending that often really gained steam when you get to the end of the fed tightening cycle thats really what continues to drive net interest margin rising which we would say would continue to rise which we would say will continue to rise throughout even if the fed continues to rise given the fact that loan data would exceed the deposit data r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 okay perfect thats great color and i guess along those lines of sort of more allencompassing rate sensitivities so i guess youre a little less asset sensitive now with isbc in there and a couple of moving parts with the hedging how would you say your overall rate sensitivity changes from here or is this sort of kind of a good steady state for right now bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me jump in its bruce and ill give it back to john but i think what weve tried to do scott is find that sweet spot where we still have asset sensitivity sufficient to participate if the fed has to keep going beyond whats expected but also we like this level of nim this level of nii and so if in fact a recession is in the offing and then rates turn down weve locked in a fair amount of that nii for a good period of time so just trying to get that balance right where we take away the downside and allow ourselves to continue to participate in the upside is where we tried to land it over the quarter john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i agree with that and the i guess the point is without management actions as you think about how the balance sheet unfolds from here a big decline in the quarter really was just pulling in isbc just the base nii alone reduces your assets and isbc just have a bigger base on that from that percentage to be calculated so that was the source of the decline primarily and our managements actions so if you take away managements actions looking forward actually our asset sensitivity would tend to begin to rise again as mentioned earlier the rotation out of consumer lending into a lot of the commercial lending and even within consumer lending the fact that heloc is a big driver which is a floating rate product you really are reestablishing asset sensitivity as the balance sheet unfolds in the coming quarters all of that is absent management actions and so thats really going to tell the tale about where we land things if we get towards the end of the year and if rates or inflation still remains stubbornly high thatll tell us where we take the balance sheet under that scenario if it feels like june was peak inflation as you get to the end of the year you would see us wanting to lock in a little bit more so well just see how it plays out but naturally underpinning the balance sheet is some upward lift on asset sensitivity bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co all right perfect bruce and john thank you guys very much bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question will come from peter winter with wedbush securities go ahead citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hi peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc i just wanted to followup on scotts question regarding the deposits but can you just talk about how youre thinking about deposit growth in the second half of this year bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc versus the second quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think the youve got a big driver being commercial and theres two drivers there one is the fact that there was some surge in the commercial business that has been running off and frankly most of thats been run off by the end of june its down to a relatively smaller level now and that was a driver also a driver is the natural seasonality of our deposit flows which tends to have as one of the lower points during the year so when you think about through the rest of the year therell be the broad continuing to execute against all the investments we made over multiple years in driving consumer deposits and also the natural uplift and frankly driving commercial as well but the natural uplift that the second half tends to deliver in the commercial side of the business from a seasonality standpoint and lower drag from surge runoff so thats how we see the second half playing out peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc and how much is in indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah just to make that clear so the net would be wed be expecting to resume growth in the second half and i think that would be led by commercial growth but consumer also would expect to see some growth as well peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 got it and you gave some color on the loan moving parts on loans in the third quarter going to be led by commercial but im just wondering if you could just be a little bit more specific on the type of growth rates youre expecting on commercial versus consumer and maybe line utilization in the third quarter john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah well i mean i think in the second quarter just talking about the jumpoff here may be helpful because in the second quarter we had on the commercial side of the house we had average growth but on a spot basis we had growth so you can see that what that implies is that youre likely to see commercial be a big driver in the second quarter so you see bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island in the third quarter john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah im sorry in the third quarter sorry yeah you see commercial being a big driver into the third quarter i think youre going to see puts and takes in consumer where you see home equity and some of the other categories that we like to see drive things in card and a little bit of mortgage driving it maybe being offset by auto and students a little bit so thats what i articulated utilization continues to increase but its been about utilization in other commercial growth and so i suspect that that will be the color into as well utilization driving about half of it and the other half coming from outside of utilization but again id say driven primarily by commercial loans maybe a similar amount of the loan growth percentage that you saw in bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and one thing about commercial and maybe i could ask don to comment on this is that when you kind of look at how companies are able to access new financing right now the public markets are pretty still in the water so youve seen kind of more opportunities for in the institutional market as well so the bank syndicated lending market has seen an uptick which i think is likely to continue as we look out into the second half so don maybe you want to give some color on that donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think thats right and just to put a point on what john said weve got utilization up by about another basis points across the ci books and the global markets books in the third quarter so that gives us a couple billion dollars in potential outstanding to bruces point were really starting to see the acceleration of a trend of companies that might want to refinance in the bond market coming to the bank market instead because the access on bank balance sheet is so much more attractive and were also seeing some transitory financing for ma transactions and for maybe some buyouts coming more under the bank balance sheets as opposed to some of the nonbank lenders so i dont know what the exact mix will be but theres a lot of things that are beginning to materialize and its not going to all go up because of that were going to take some other portfolios down and slow down some other things similar to what brendan said which we have been doing for two or three years now just to change the mix of whats on the book so get a little more selective in terms of both returns of the capital were deploying but also citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 being very careful of credit risk and the like just in case we go into a little bit deeper slide so were just being protective of the risk front also john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and one of the things maybe just to close out there a little bit is to broaden it out to the second half i think we mentioned the fact theres a lot of moving parts here and so we tried to really make it clear that our april guide had a to range of loan growth associated with it for the year and were basing all of these moving parts are going to fall into that range of the to loan growth increase in and hopefully thats helpful and how it shakes out between and theres a lot going on there but were expecting to deliver as we indicated we would at our last guidance peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thanks for all the color operator your next question will be from gerard cassidy with rbc go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning bruce good morning john john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island good morning bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc bruce you guys have done a good job on credit and youve identified the outlook as being healthy strong through possibly the end of the year but a little more cautious as we go into next year which is completely understandable can you share with us what you guys are thinking about not so much the traditional credit areas like consumer lending home equity or student loans but more from a institutional market if the fed pursues this quantitative tightening which they claim they will billion a month what kind of disruption are you guys kind of looking at possibly that could happen separate from the traditional unemployment rates going up and all that stuff i think most of us can understand that but the new part is this quantitative tightening that we really havent experienced how are you guys kind of thinking about that going forward bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well were a bit in unchartered waters because we havent seen quantitative easing to the extent we have and now the amount of tightening that theyre planning is going to be interesting to watch i mean if i step back and citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 think about where did a lot of that additional liquidity end up i think the biggest banks took on a lot of it the custody banks took on a lot of it and i think when we view our space the superregional space maybe we had some benefit from it but a lot of it was just working on our playbook to deliver better for customers and establish whole relationships where we can capture the deposit opportunities that we were probably suboptimized on both on the consumer side and the commercial side so i think the tightening process youd probably see it most impact the folks where the liquidity ended up which would in my view be the bigger banks and the custody banks and a bank like us we still have a number of initiatives where i think were not fully optimized in terms of the deposits per our relationship base and were going to continue to go try to gain market share and grab that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and can you think about it also from the loan side do you think that the qt could have some type of impact obviously its going to take liquidity out of the market but i dont know how you guys thinking about it in terms of maybe some of the syndicated business that youve been doing quite successfully in the past bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i guess im not i dont necessarily think that will be a huge driver in the loan volumes i think the level of gdp growth and that spurs activity in animal spirits and wanting to put money to work i think thats a bigger driver but maybe on that ill defer over to don if don you have any thoughts donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah im not gerard im not too worried about the loan syndication piece and again volumes are much lower than they were and i think it will be where the action is but the mega deals seem to be struggling a little bit so if you think about the environment were in the biggest challenge we have on transactional execution is larger transaction and then clearing through the marketplace and so i think youll see a little bit of a dearth there thats not really the business were in so i dont think it will affect our business and then the other thing is you think about whats the price action that goes on in the securities market as the fed is a seller versus a buyer and i think one of the things that im looking at is the maturity ladder for corporate bonds and particularly highyield bonds is relatively light for the next couple of years because everybody took advantage of the low interest rate environment of the last couple of years and refinanced and pushed those maturities out so i think we have some time for the market to adjust particularly the public market to adjust to the ph q3 trend that were going to see gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question you guys put aside billion i think of loans from investors or youre holding in for a sale can you kind of give us a description of what types of loans and you also indicated that your criticized loans on a standalone basis went down which is good of course but they were stable when you included the investors criticized loans are any of the criticized loans for investors in the billion held for sale citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah the biggest driver of that book is in equipment finance book which is about half of it and there are some nonaccruals and nonpass assets that did go into that portfolio but more importantly we think our underlying fundamentals with respect to the criticized being stable was a very good outcome there are youve got some criticized coming out of isbc with not a lot of loss content and thats just a mechanism of migrating from a state chartered approach to how you manage that kind of stuff to an occmanaged approach so that was the impact there but loss content quite low and on an acl basis pound for pound the needs from an acl perspective are actually lower on the isbc side of things given that profile that came over so were feeling pretty good about that gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you fellows thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator your next question will come from erika najarian with ubs go ahead erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning just taking a step back you guys have done a great job giving us exquisite detail in terms of what youre expecting underneath that nii outlook im just wondering if we could talk about it more strategically given how much the bank has changed since the last interest rate cycle so bruce in the last interest rate cycle you took advantage of putting forth great offers through citizens access and im wondering as you think about the composition of your balance sheet now especially after investors how should investors think about this goforward citizens deposit gathering strategy how aggressive are you going to be in terms of competing in rate and is there room to lower some rate in the acquired portfolio from investors on the deposit side that would allow you to be maybe slightly more aggressive on the rate side on the citizens access front bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah let me start and then ill pass the baton here to maybe brendan and john but id say we feel really good about the progress weve made in just reformulating the deposit base both in consumer and in commercial so in consumer taking a much more relationship orientation and not having that kind of thriftlike lead with rate orientation that we kind of inherited when we got here and so you can just see the results of that in terms of the noninterestbearing growth the affluent household growth the stickiness of the deposits and the size per household going up so all those trends are terrific and i think they continue so thats the cornerstone of the deposit strategy going forward i think we have been pretty astute in setting up citizens access and giving ourselves a kind of narrow swim lane to go after interestsensitive deposits and compete for those i dont think thats ever going to really become citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 outsized relative to the overall mix i think its good to have and its when we need incremental deposits we can play with the rate we can bring them in but it serves its purpose ultimately if we get the national bank to where we want to get it maybe some of those deposits will be a little rate sensitive as we try to get full wallet relationships with some of the national customer base and then on commercial again i think we werent as aggressive in seeking the operating accounts as weve been over the last few years and certainly seen a lot of growth there and then we didnt have the full range of capabilities things like escrow services and other services that different segments of the customer base need we werent competitive they werent built out and so weve now built those out and so i think our whole speed in deposit growth going forward can continue to be reasonably strong and hopefully wed like to get it growing faster than kind of the peers which would give us a lot of flexibility in terms of the amount of loan growth that we can fund while maintaining an ldr in kind of the mid to upper so thats a little bit top of the house thought process around that but brendan maybe you could add something on the consumer side brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah yeah i mean on the consumer side id say the last upcycle for rates was a bit of a perfect storm for us for higher beta as we had a business model as bruce pointed out that was more thriftoriented had higher promotional balances we were growing loans materially faster than peers so we had to fund up the loan growth on a base that was a little bit less healthy than peers and then we hadnt fully built out all of our capabilities in the bank so as i stare at consumer right now i look at all of those dynamics the underpinning health of the portfolio has remixed materially to lowcost deposits and thats based on just increased primacy and engagement with customers thats longterm value creation and that continues to improve quarteroverquarter quarterover quarter thats allowed us to bring our elastic deposits down so last upcycle we had something like billion to billion in promotionally priced elastic deposits thats now in the midsingle digits in the core bank putting aside citizens access so the portfolio is mixed from the mid percentages on low cost into the thats a big buffer for better beta performance we still believe the consumer segment will have a to net improvement rate cycle over rate cycle in betas the other things weve done is we built a lot of tools and capabilities so citizens access is now something were very good at but thats not it weve built a dramatically different product composition in the core bank weve built a highly sophisticated analytic capabilities with better targeting so we do think we can go and very targeted raise deposits in the core bank but with much more precision than we did in the past which will really mute the beta impact in consumer and allow us where we need to get deposit growth we can contain it in citizens access last point i would make is inside of citizens access we are starting to see some green shoots of deeper relationships beginning to form so its not just this contained deposit raising mechanism on the side and thats going to benefit both betas but also cost and so were doing some tests to drive citizens access deposit raising across our national mortgage customers international student loan customers early results have been quite positive as we start to raise rates and thats going to make it much more affordable for us to drive those deposits on the expense side not just the beta side so a lot of improvements in the health of the franchise i would suggest the consumer bank is in a dramatically different position right now than we were five seven years ago bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 great answer brendan don do you want to add anything donald h mccree a vice chairman headcommercial banking citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say its similar to brendan i mean we basically did not have a liquidity in deposit group seven years ago when we started our journey here and our payments business was fundamentally subscale and subpar so were getting a good lift on the payment sales and the core operating business as you said bruce which is bringing some deposits with it and just our analytics and our capabilities not to mention the product suite that weve begun to develop is just on a completely different place so if a much stronger relationship pull with the client base as the client base grows theres more opportunity to bring in deposits so we feel very confident in terms of the deposit franchise at the moment john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah indiscernible the whole team here erika but its a good question obviously but just your other point on investors id say that given our history i think were particularly well placed to embark upon that migration of that deposit base as well and were beginning that process we closed this quarter and weve already begun to run our playbook through this rising rate cycle where were lagging rate on that platform which otherwise might not have been lagged and etcetera etcetera and so were making the investments necessary so were optimistic that well begin to see some benefits coming out of that which was also part of your question bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc great thank you so much operator well next go to ken usdin with jefferies go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies company hey thanks guys good morning just if i can backtrack on a couple of things when you refer to the april full year guidance i think the output was a plus or minus billionish for the year is that still the zone that were talking about as you reiterated this quarter with a different mix bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well i mean i think what were reiterating is the ppnr implied by that guide and so yeah i mean i think and you see and we talked about the puts and takes on that seeing nii coming in a little better and with some offsets in fees and expenses and with some offsets in fees and expenses well controlled and welldisciplined on that and credit looking very positive and better than we expected as well ken usdin q analyst jefferies company citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 okay second question can you give us now that the isbc is in the full quarter any update on the magnitude and expected timing and run rating of the original million of cost saves you expected john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah id say the best way to think about that is by the end of the year youll see a run rate of about of that million and then the full amount of the million coming in next year ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay so would you know what quarter you expect that to be kind of fully captured next year john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island well next year yeah we havent touched that i mean the big driver of it is getting the close done in the first quarter so it will substantially all of that will be done by midyear and therell be some trickling in benefits in the second half but most of that will be getting there by the middle part of ken usdin q analyst jefferies company got it and last quick one there was an increase in shortterm borrowed funds in fhlbs and im just wondering you had the ones that were at isbc and you had previously talked about getting rid of those through merger accounting so im just wondering did that chunk that came over from isbc get taken out or is this are we now seeing the ads and are there extra ads on top of it kind of if you could just talk through those two buckets the shortterm borrowed funds and the fhlbs relative to what might have come from isbc or whats just new adds because of your funding mix thanks john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah we had a carryover of about billion from isbc and then the rest of the balance sheet flows on our end in terms of loan growth and securities growth drove the rest of the changes in the quarter bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah and i would say on that that ultimately some of that timing ken is that the fhlb borrowings from investors will roll off and we have cash coming in from some of the portfolios that we place for sale so we would expect to this is kind of the high water mark on the fhlb all things equal and that we would bring that down by yearend ken usdin q analyst jefferies company okay got it thank you operator your next question will come from vivek juneja from jpmorgan go ahead citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thank you a couple of questions youve mentioned regarding the ppnr guide wellcontrolled expenses your expenses this quarter i think have come in at the high end of the range you gave for last quarter including hsbc isbc when you mentioned wellcontrolled expenses for full year can you give a little more color on what a little higher than where you were previously expecting lower unchanged any color on that john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah i think were seeing some positive benefits coming out of expenses and so when we say wellcontrolled i think we have some optimism that thats going to be no greater than and possibly a little less than we expected vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay even though second quarter was at the high end are you seeing some other additional cost savings or bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island i dont know if thats true we if we set up to given higher revenuebased compensation expense was the guide and they came in up so im not sure where thats at the high end of the range vivek vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay because im just looking at reported bruce and you were at to and came in at on report right bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yes i mean you have to look at underlying because thats really the integration costs that ticked that up so if you look at our underlying we actually thought we did a really good job to keep them virtually flat and then we would expect that strong performance to continue into q3 and we called out i think maybe for the whole year its roughly where we are so john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and just on the integration cost effect we did see more integration costs this quarter but thats not signaling higher integration costs its just the opposite were pulling some in to this quarter were expecting integration costs overall to be lower than we announced at bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island yeah that was just a pull forward vivek into q2 vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 okay thats helpful a completely different question early delinquencies can you give us the numbers by loan category for second quarter meaning 30day to 89day delinquencies bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island overall in the consumer side delinquencies have been flat to even some signals of being very modestly down actually were seeing in no portfolio that were looking at that we see any signs of reinflation both at the 30day level all the way through 90day so with 120day cycle to get to a net charge off it would take a whole heck of a lot of what you would need to believe to see net charge offs in the consumer segment go up materially between now and the end of the year and obviously the place were watching on the net charge offline is things like used car values and recoveries on the resi portfolio but those have been very stable and very high and very positive we dont expect that to move very much either so just the message overall on the consumer segment side is everything remains in great shape and without really any signs of a tick up and the fundamentals remain strong too consumer still have more in liquidity and deposits than precovid and you know customer pay rates on credit cards pay in full still are in the low40 percentile that was in the low before covid so to believe that youd start to see delinquency ticking up you first probably see deposits start to burn down and you start to see customers relevering were not seeing that now were a little bit unique from some peers in that our customer base skews much more mass affluent than affluent but even when we indiscernible brendan coughlin a executive vice president headconsumer banking citizens financial group inc rhode island credit score was super prime and high prime bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island were a superprime lender where you see some market commentary on early signs of credit it tends to be in the subprime space and we dont have any of those businesses but we dont see any signs of credit stress in any portfolio really across any of the segments that were in vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay and not even in the other retail partnerships you put on the point of sale are you seeing any stretching by consumer there in terms of levering up more bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island no i would direct you to a month or two ago john and i went to the morgan stanley conference and we shared some credit strap portfolio by portfolio the citizens pay portfolio is performing exceptionally well and is in fact multiples below our prime credit card portfolio and so not only is it super prime but its performing four five six times better than even a credit card portfolio so we feel very good about the citizens financial group inc rhode island cfg corrected transcript q2 earnings call 19jul2022 john f woods a vice chairman chief financial officer citizens financial group inc rhode island and thats because we draw a tight credit box in terms of what we are willing to take on indiscernible bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island exactly and where you start to weve been very ambitious in our desire to grow that business but yeah weve been disciplined on credit and were not going to undisciplined on credit in that business to drive growth and so where weve been slower to see growth manifest in citizens pay its because were not willing to jeopardize our credit discipline and i dont see equally any signs of stress whatsoever and the citizens pay portfolio remains in great shape vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you bruce winfield van saun a chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island sure operator there are no further questions in queue and with that ill turn it back to mr van saun for closing remarks bruce winfield van saun chairman chief executive officer citizens financial group inc rhode island all righty well thanks thanks again for dialing in today we
