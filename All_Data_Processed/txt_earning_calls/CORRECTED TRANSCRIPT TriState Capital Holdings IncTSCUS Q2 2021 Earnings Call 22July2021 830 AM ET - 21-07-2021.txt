getz chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning and thank you for joining us tristate capital delivered a very strong financial result in the second quarter as each of our businesses made meaningful contributions to our top and bottom lines we believe tristate capital banks organic loan growth annualized from the linked quarter will be truly exceptional relative to peers and the industry and our chartwell investment partners business also delivered differentiating organic growth with doubledigit annual growth in assets under management in the quarter to a record billion collectively our loans deposits and assets under management reached an alltime highs this growth helped us to generate record levels of quarterly revenue pretaxpreprovision net revenue pretax income and net income available to common stockholders additionally net income available to common stockholders grew by some annualized from the linked quarter and from the second quarter of we also delivered earnings per share of growing eps even with a higher share count and preferred dividends from our december capital raise continuing our record of efficiently and effectively putting new capital to work through the responsible and meaningful growth of this company in addition all this quarter earnings growth was achieved solely through organic means and with continued modest provision expense what makes these results possible and what differentiates this company from competitors large and small is our people we now have more than billion in onbalancesheet assets and client assets under management as our teams impeccable reputation for client service expertise and results continue to attract new business and grow existing relationships revenue per employee a metric youve heard us highlight regularly was in the second quarter on an annualized basis this is more than twice the level that the median billion to billion asset bank generated based on most recent quarter data our agile business model combined with our culture of valuing each individuals contributions and focus on building the best team has driven our collective performance at this level were expanding our scalability and responsiveness through further investments in technology designed to support our people and enhance their ability to provide bestinclass service to our clients we are investing in our client engagement experience and offerings to position us for enhanced market share profitability all while maintaining our operating leverage we believe these investments will in turn support continued earnings growth and longterm value creation for our shareholders tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 following its breakout performance in the first quarter chartwell has done everything but slow down assets under management of billion and annual run rate revenue of million at june each reflect growth of more than from one year prior in the second quarter our asset managers strong performance attracted continued positive net flows products like core core plus and shortduration bbrated high yield are attracting flows from new and existing institutional and retail clients seeking enhanced yield with a focus on credit quality and interest rate sensitivity the combination of asset and revenue growth that weve achieved at chartwell is further supported by incremental improvement in operating leverage as we continue to benefit from past initiatives to moderate chartwells segment expenses while continuing to invest in new products marketing and distribution yearto date investment management fees have grown at yearoveryear while expenses have grown at almost half this rate generating significant operating leverage we are particularly proud of the chartwell teams ability to grow revenues at this clip in the current rate environment with fixed income representing some of total assets under management we are thoroughly focused on continued organic growth chartwells new business pipeline began the third quarter with more than million in unfunded institutional commitments we are also investing in product development including a new chartwell shortduration highgrade bond fund this new product leverages the talents of our fixed income team and serves as a complement to our very successful shortduration highyield strategy which has grown to represent more than of aum chartwell sees significant retail and institutional demand for this new shortduration product we have total confidence in our fixed income teams abilities and the sales and distribution team is motivated to bring it to market meanwhile tristate capital bank grew total loans by more than over last year and nearly during the quarter to billion on june thats annualized growth of lending to very high quality clients and the differentiated and attractive markets weve served for years this exceptional growth continues to be driven by private banking loans which grew to some billion or nearly of total loans at the end of the quarter thats because these loans which are collateralized by marketable securities cash value life insurance policies from select issuers and other liquid assets are an excellent and timely solution for many high net worth borrowers across all economic and market cycles especially the current environment with a referral network of financial intermediaries including independent financial advisers trust companies family offices brokerdealers regional securities firms and insurance companies we expect to continue dominating market share and driving formidable growth in this business moving forward additionally private banking loan application volume is up from the second quarter of and reached a new record level we expect continued growth although we continue to focus our origination efforts on where we can deliver the most meaningful benefits and experience to borrowers and their advisors commercial loans totaled billion at june up from oneyear prior and from march commercial real estate loans grew nearly annualized while totaling just of total loans as we continue to partner with what we believe are some of the highestquality and most experienced sponsors in our markets commercial and industrial lending was down from the linked quarter as new originations and draws on lines of credit and growth in equipment finance production were offset by amortization and paydowns this activity in the ci book is reflective of seasonal trends and temporary supply chain dynamics but we are optimistic about the second half of the year both our cre and ci portfolios remain well diversified have grown solely by organic means and have strong pipelines tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 our private banking business which made up of total loans at the end of the second quarter as well as the highquality nature of our commercial banking relationships continue to favorably impact our asset quality metrics and credit costs credit quality has long been a differentiator for tristate capital and we further improved our metrics in the second quarter we reduced adverserated credits by some compared to the linked first quarter on our billion book of loans we reported just million of adverserated credits or basis points of total loans nonperforming assets totaled basis points of total assets and net chargeoffs were just basis points of average total loans importantly the second quarter chargeoff activity was previously reserved for in prior periods our significant loan growth allows for improved profitability and deployment of liquidity which continues to be readily available and inexpensive our team has done a tremendous job with liquidity management ensuring that we are managing against excess liquidity by timing our pipeline and putting our liquidity to work in highquality assets deposit growth during the second quarter fully funded our loan and investment growth with record deposits of more than billion at quarterend reflecting growth over the last months and during the quarter treasury management deposits doubled from june and now make up of total deposits were excited about our continued addition of meaningful and longterm client relationships these deposits support our efforts to effectively manage deposit costs which we reduced by basis points during the quarter this in turn contributed to our third consecutive quarter of net interest margin expansion up another basis points from the first three months of the year second quarter nii grew to a record million up over the second quarter of last year marking tristate capitals 22nd consecutive quarter of annual net interest income growth this is the result of the high quality and robust volume were achieving particularly in private banking we currently view responsible volume growth as the primary driver of net interest income expansion in as we position for favorable profitability when rates do rise nii was complemented by record noninterest income driven by our strong investment management fees and solid swap fees during the quarter excluding securities gains and losses nii and noninterest income combined to generate record quarterly total revenue of million this reflects an increase of from the linked quarter where annualized which we believe will further differentiate tristate capitals latest results from similar sized peers in industry overall looking ahead we remain focused on measuring our performance through operating leverage and growing revenue at a faster clip than operating expenses our expenses were in line with our expectations and reflective of investments were making in people technology clients and the products against the backdrop of the challenging economic environment we showed what our company is capable of loans deposits and total assets each crossed significant thresholds during the quarter surpassing billion billion and billion respectively we are enhancing net income consequentially in a low interest rate environment driven by our penetration of niche markets our wellpositioned distribution capabilities and high quality client service delivered by motivated professionals who are focused on effective execution this company has reached critical mass providing it with the flexibility to continue investing meaningfully for the future and providing impactful earnings to the bottom line on a consistent basis tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 we enter the second half of the year with strong confidence and healthy pipelines across all three of our business lines for year we remain keenly focused on growing each of total revenue loans and deposits at to rate over managing the annual expense growth to a lowdoubledigit rate continuing to generate positive net asset inflows and expand segment profit margins at chartwell and continuing to grow net interest income dollars all while maintaining our hallmark superior asset quality that concludes my prepared remarks id now ask the operator to open the lines for qa question and answer section operator ladies and gentlemen at this point we will begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question today comes from michael perito from kbw please go ahead with your question michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey everybody good morning james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning mike david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc good morning mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i wanted to start with kind of a highlevel question jim the deposit growth and really improvement over the last few years has been really notable and i guess my question is as we look ahead i mean obviously the rate environment is hard to predict but i mean i think consensus outlook seem to be factoring some rate hikes at some point the next 24ish months and curious if you guys just have any highlevel thoughts on how the deposit portfolio might perform in that type of environment relative to your performance in the past i mean it seems like the relationships are a little bit stronger over the last few years with some of the hiring efforts that youve made and then obviously the banking environment as a whole is a bit more digital now than it was four five years ago so just curious if you guys have any highlevel thoughts on how or expectations about how that might perform if we do get into some type of rate increasing environment james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 michael let me make a couple general comments and then im going to turn it over to brian fetterolf whos the ceo of our bank what youre seeing is the results of some years of really focusing on each aspect of this business and its been coming to fruition slowly over the period of the years and what you want to keep in mind as i mentioned almost in every single one of these reports that weve put highly experienced sophisticated individuals in place and theyve for us on the liquidity side built a very sophisticated funding mechanism and its working and we can control the flows that come in place through the relationships we have in place and if you were to look at the turnover that we have of our relationship managers its almost nonexistent in that regard and these are people that had a great deal of experience in their prior life and were leveraging off that and seeing the results today in these numbers so i would suggest to you that better times are yet to come brian brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah thanks thanks jim tough to follow that last statement there but yeah i would agree with jims characterization that were looking forward very optimistically we are in as jim mentioned weve built it over years you can look at the last two years in particular to see the diversification of that growth treasury management obviously as we pointed out has doubled in the last year and thats just one segment but obviously servicebased deposits being a key piece of our forwardstrategy relationship deposits being the broadest piece and as jim indicated the people that weve brought in have those key relationships and again keep in mind that this is a national depositgathering capability so we think that that provides us a huge scale but we are super focused right now on being there meaningfully for existing clients to grow with them and we are seeing our existing clients grow and attracting new clients as well and with the technology investments were making again we look at this as very timeless technology investments the obsolescence is low which allows us to continue to build better and better service capabilities products for clients were attracting new clients the fastest rate we ever had but to your point we are building for two years from now in our deposit pipeline and portfolio michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it helpful and then this is my followon question maybe a question for jim or tim just on chartwell revenues are up nicely quarteronquarter yearonyear i mean if the market cooperates is it fair to think of this business as kind of a highsingledigit revenue growth type business at this point with all the investments you made and can you just remind us also what the ma landscape and appetite is ph if any on your business at this point as well james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc michael let me comment with regard to your question generally and then ill turn it over to tim i take you back to march of and the condition of the market drove chartwells assets down to billion we determined at that time tim and myself and a lot of others that we were going to solely focus on bringing chartwell back from that level tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 and now as you can see today it has billion weve been hugely successful and i would see us at some point as we go into the new year of being much more aggressive in that market theres a lot of opportunities that are available there but we wanted to get our own captive infrastructure back in shape and breathing strongly and i think you can see by the flows the net income its delivering the revenue growth that its having an impact tim timothy joseph riddle a managing partner chief executive officer chartwell investment partners llc yeah michael first of all good morning were certainly captive of the market environment as you well know but we would certainly expect with the exceptional results that weve been able to achieve particularly on the fixed income side and with the unique type of products that we have available to both the institutional and the retail market that again revenue growth as you had indicated is certainly something that we believe is achievable not only in the second half of the year but going forward as well and as jim indicated were solely focused on organic growth of the franchise and well continue to look but obviously in this environment there could be an opportunity that presents itself and we would be open to that but were certainly not leading with our chin our job is to grow chartwell organically michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks tim and thank you guys for taking my questions james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc all right operator our next question comes from daniel tamayo from raymond james please go ahead with your question daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc good morning guys james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning danny david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc good morning danny daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc just wanted to follow up on your balance sheet growth commentary i think you reiterated what youve said in the past about to growth for loans and deposits this year if i heard that correctly looks like loan growth tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 already about and deposit growth already for the year is that just conservative commentary or you think that youre expecting a slowdown in the second half there brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah this is brian hey danny we i would say i mean obviously yearoveryear our third and fourth quarters last year were pretty impressive quarters as well so well probably look at it from an average balance perspective and the spot but overall we remain optimistic on the second half the second quarter and the fourth quarter more seasonal historically those have been sort of our strongest quarters so were not surprised that second quarter performed so well but i think we indicated even last quarter that we would expect to be at the higher end of that and range and that looks like thats where were going to be able to pull through we continue to be optimistic on the private bank side were seeing a sort of very strong market acceptance and sort of our distribution and our internal client engagement efforts continue to grow that so we dont see any slowdown there in the commercial side and we think well take up a bit as we indicated between the supply chain loosening on the equipment finance and some fund finance aspect so still think and is a right place to direct us but at the topend of that would be the right place daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and then maybe for dave you talked in the past about the nim expansion getting up to the mid to high by the end of the year weve seen obviously some pressure on the 10year just wanted to see if thats still how youre thinking about it in the current rate environment or if you need rates to rise from here to get back to that mid to high1 david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc no danny we still believe that as weve long said were more focused on net interest income growth through sort of reasonable and riskmanaged growth in loans and investments building durable relationships and matching liquidity with their needs as we build the franchise we were pleased that were able to expand nim in the quarter and we see that expansion continuing for the rest of the year primarily be driven by deposit cost reductions as we manage deposit balances in line with the opportunities for deploying that liquidity we believe that well be able to achieve further cost reductions in that category as we continue to grow deposits and as weve shared with you at the beginning of the year we would again expect that the nim will be somewhere in the mid to high1 by yearend daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah it might be a good place to add real quickly just from tenure perspective certainly its a metric that we watch but we think that again if you roll it over to the swap revenue opportunity weve demonstrated we can tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 work with the swap market and all markets and all rate curves flat steepening and inverted but yeah were pretty happy with where the tenure is right now it gives us a lot of opportunities our clients are super engaged at these levels so we think that we in some respects the stock sometimes trades obviously with the industry and around that tenure because of everybodys exposure to that we would say we have more opportunities in that kind of environment so obviously thats separate from the nim question but from a revenue perspective were happy where we are and obviously its good for chartwell as well daniel tamayo q analyst raymond james associates inc thats great color appreciate it thanks guys operator our next question comes from matt olney from stephens please go ahead with your question matt olney q analyst stephens inc thanks good morning i want to go back to discussion around deposits and as you mentioned the banks made tremendous progress lowering deposit costs and really growing the treasury management business and i expect well see more of the benefits of that with higher rates but i guess given the floating rate nature of tristate assets im curious what the appetite is at this point to start considering locking in some longerterm funding on the liability side thanks david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc matt good morning we certainly talk about that regularly its something were looking at evaluating but weve not done anything at scale yet we continue to be quite pleased with the treasury management growth those balances are of our total deposits now which we just started that business four or five years ago so well certainly continue to look at that in an effort to drive total return to the shareholder and well update you with any strategy we employ on a goforward basis brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc and i think i would just add to that obviously we look at the deposit portfolio as an opportunity i mean its obviously a way to fund the lending part of our business but again just take a brief outtake for relationship building right and so some of our time deposits might be what clients are expecting some of it will be what wed like to do so its a bit of at this point its a market where our clients are not requesting that so that puts us in the spot where we get to design the product mix and at this point as david mentioned yeah we think we have the right product mix at this point but were watching it consistently and putting our own forecasts together on yeah what we think would happen and what would make sense matt olney q analyst stephens inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 okay thats helpful and then any update on the loan floors i think the press release mentioned that of the loans are floating and indexed at days just remind us how active the floors are currently and any commentary you can provide on how many fed fund hikes wed have to see to get above those floors thanks brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah great yeah its less than two so theres a bit of a difference on the floor levels across the different loan product types but in two fed rate moves we would be through the floors on average fundamentally so its been a significant contributor to the business over the last months but as we continue to adapt new loan originations and how were approaching spreads and floors going forward it would be about two rate moves as you look at the whole loan portfolio matt olney q analyst stephens inc thank you operator our next question comes from steve moss from b riley fbr please go ahead with your question steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc hi good morning james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc morning steve david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc morning steve steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc maybe just starting off with the loan mix here you crossed over this quarter for private banking loans just kind of curious where are you thinking that mix ends up by yearend here brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc sorry just to clarify you mean as a portion of growth or just overall portfolio steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc the overall portfolio and yes definitely any color on growth would be good too just because august momentum seems very strong here tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yes great so yeah we continue to grow into the mid from a portfolio composition perspective i mean as youre seeing when we say to were talking about the private bank obviously a larger base and then growing at not quite double but a premium a multiple of the commercial side so that will continue to grow i think this second quarter is probably a bit probably a bigger difference between the rates of growth i think the third quarter will probably a bit more reflective but i think what were talking about the commercial side growing and the private bank more on so thats for the to steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great thats helpful and then in terms of just loan pricing these days just wondering if you could give any update on where spreads are for commercial loans and the commercial real estate and also the private banking loans brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah so i think from our guidance perspective from last time we were on our i think we are probably still in the same place our cre loans from a yield perspective sort of that to range ci loans sort of the to in a quarter range and private bank loans probably at to range so those are from a yield perspective where we are seeing things come in now steve moss q analyst b riley securities inc okay great thank you very much appreciate that brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yes great operator and our next question comes from russell gunther from da davidson please go ahead with your questions russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co hey good morning guys david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc morning russell james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc good morning russell tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co just a quick followup on the ci expectations for the back half of the year i appreciate your comments in the prepared remarks and the qa but just if you could give some color on whats driving the optimism in the back half i know equipment finance is seasonally strong in but any other color in terms of order of magnitude for growth and what the drivers are there brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yes i think were i mean if you look at our again rate of growth expectations or our goals for the commercial side probably slightly lower than weve had in past years so thats a growth rate it is probably optimistic for a lot of people its probably middle of the road for us so pleased but not satisfied with that just from a point of perspective but yeah the first half of the year were continuing to see good production on the commercial real estate side i mean i would say that weve actually seen a little bit from unanticipated idiosyncratic payoff perspective on commercial real estate where some of our clients not looking to sell were offered some pretty significant opportunities so weve lost that balance in the short term but those are clients that we work with very significantly and we see them redeploying that capital into new opportunities so well be there with them to grow that piece back but overall the commercial real estate were confident in our ability to continue to grow that positive sense with our clients and then the fund finance if we look at it were only about million borrowed against about million in commitments so we see a significant opportunity for that to tick up in the second half of the year so we continue to grow that business very nicely and we like who were working with but we see more opportunities and just timing of where theyre going to put capital to work in the second half so thatll be positive and then as we indicated second half usually better for equipment and finance anyway but as supply chains ease and things of that nature deals that weve already won that well fund in the third and fourth quarter that will be positive so those are the fundamental aspects i mean nothing really i think were nothing exceptional pretty consistent themes that weve had in over the year just coming to play in the second half of the year but overall were very optimistic about how our clients and prospects are performing again if you look at our i mean we obviously provided deferral activity but were as of today were down to two loans that are still on the deferral program of less than million so again the way that our clients have managed through this and are growing actually through the timeframe is very strong so were optimistic about our ability to grow with our existing clients as well as attract new ones russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co i appreciate the color brian thank you and then just switching gears for the last question to expenses you guys reiterated the to expectation for this year and as you continue to plan for the future and continue to franchise investment and items like travel and entertainment like begin to normalize is that a range that you expect to be able to maintain over a longer term or are there nearterm plans for the businesses that could push that range higher going forward tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc this is jim getz let me comment first and this is probably one of the only times in this type of call that youll hear this this expense growth has always been by design and our expenses clearly reflect our continual investment in our people our infrastructure our technology and our clients while moving toward the future and were doing this as you notice in this quarters numbers while our profit margins are expanding so thats what i meant in the end of my presentation when we talked about critical mass weve reached that critical mass level that were going to be able to continue to do that and invest in the future while were providing a profitable franchise to our shareholders david david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah russell let me just add some color commentary to that so yearoveryear weve grown a revenue at the balance sheets grown at and expenses as you note are growing at about this supports our overall goal of positive operating leverage importantly the overall efficiency ratio for the bank has slightly improved when comparing the yeartodate results over the prior year as has the noninterest expense the average asset ratio efficiency ratio stands at yeartodate and noninterest expense is about our roe our return on equity has steadily and substantially improved in each of the last four quarters that now stands at on a spot basis as of the most recent quarter as we put the capital that weve raised in two different raises last year to work we believe we can continue to drive roe improvements in the quarters ahead what this tells us is that the investments were making that jim pointed out are driving better execution and making our business more efficient and effective it tells us that were making good investments let me give you some color on the primary drivers of expense growth one is people compensation cost is up yearoveryear and technology and data services is up yearoveryear the growth rate on these two expenses should moderate somewhat in the second half of the year hiring was minimized last year second quarter in light of the early stages of the pandemic whereas this year we have frontloaded that hiring to the beginning of the year coupled with some strong financial results driving incentive accrual increases but that hiring piece should moderate somewhat in the second half in the area of technology and data we delayed our innovation and development spend through the second quarter of again in light of the pandemic but began implementing more robust development in the second half of last year and that continues into for technology and data on a fullyear basis i would say the year overyear comparison should be somewhere in the low to mid20 range down from of what youre seeing right now other expenses is also something that grew very modestly in the quarter it was driven by growth on our unfunded loan commitments that expense is categorized differently than the funded onbalancesheet loans through the reserves in the income statement so just simply a function of growth we still intend to drive positive operating leverage growing revenue faster than expenses and we are driving to keep expense growth to yearoveryear weve got work to do to get there but we will not sacrifice our longterm objectives and well continue to focus on serving our clients well brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 yes ill just add i think both jim and david summed it up well were excited about where were going weve continued to we took about a fourweek hiatus last year just to see where things would sort of level out in the second quarter but absent that four weeks weve continued to invest in the business understanding where the opportunities are and again as we sit here around the table were as optimistic as we ever have been in all the lines of the business i think jim summed it up earlier we couldnt be more happy with what were showing here and this makes sense to keep investing in this and staying ahead of it and rewarding not only paying off growth rewarding investors and rewarding our clients for continuing to grow with us russell e t gunther q analyst d a davidson co thank you all for taking my questions and the detailed response james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thank you operator and ladies and gentlemen we have a followup from matt olney from stephens please go ahead with your followup matt olney q analyst stephens inc yeah thanks for taking the followup i guess as i speak with investors it seems like the markets very concerned about tristates impact to higher shortterm rates and we talked earlier about the floors that could be a potential headwind for at least the first few rate hikes but i guess taking a step back im curious what youd expect from the banks net interest margin on the first few rate hikes i guess if i look at the 10q disclosures around the shock analysis my assumption is is that the bank does expect an initial downward move in the margin with the first few rate hikes but i would love to hear any commentary you can add to that david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc so matt we just followed the dot plot right and so the dot plot would suggest theres two raises sometime in but if i just look at our forecast for the next two years which obviously is very preliminary we see a modest expansion throughout that period so were not tied to the tenure were tied to short rates as you point out but between deposit cost moderation things that were studying in terms of sort of fixing rates for a longer period of time and just the ability to deploy the liquidity quickly into incomeproducing assets we see a modest expansion through the next two years brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc i think from a positive deposit perspective yeah the one thing thats not modeled in there is again from a client perspective our goal is to work with every product that they would need and our goal is to own their entire relationship so we have a blend of noninterestbearing and interestbearing deposits with them tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 but if you look at the service side of the business and you look at like our treasury management business i think weve talked about before in a normalized rate environment our goal is to run that business on the rate side at a libor equivalent of minus basis points so libor whatever index you want to pick less basis points so if you think about here where obviously there is no libor minus so yeah we think that theres a lot of protection built into the existing business which is a natural hedge which is obviously the way weve built it and then obviously as we talked before with opportunities for us to build in term deposits and some other things we get closer but that breakeven point is pretty important as youd know and so absent a real client demand were probably a little early in that process but again a lot of natural hedges built into the business that maybe werent as robust in the timeframe matt olney q analyst stephens inc and within the deposit balance can you remind us what percent of those are indexed and how would you expect that to change if at all over the next few years brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah so if you look at overall i mean we talked about it in the release that we talked about of what it would be of nontimed interestbearing deposits i would link to a eff or some equivalent index so if we look at overall it comes out about of total deposits that would be indexed in that way so yeah i am moderating that pretty significantly at one point were probably more in that range so we think again a good diversification across the deposit portfolio i mean we still like that from a pricing perspective and its building its a source of a lot of sophisticated relationships with us who we have private bank relationships with other lending aspects so were happy with that component of the portfolio but its a good measure of where we continue to diversify the deposit base and the pricing base matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thats great brian thanks for that and then i guess the last question is around capital and im looking at the leverage ratio at the bank i think were now ill call it and i think we saw the capital raise last year when we got down to that level so wed love to hear any updated thoughts you have on addressing the capital needs of the bank especially given the strong outlook for loan growth repair david j demas a chief financial officertristate capital bank tristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah matt as you point out weve grown the balance sheet at the higher end of our expectations this year strong growth and we expect that to continue weve worked hard to put the capital raise last year to use in high quality new loans and increase balance sheet liquidity in the investment portfolio were striving to get to that close to or get that to and were close now i talked a little earlier about our roe our return on equity were pleased that its at we believe we have more room to improve that in the coming quarters and thats up from this time last year so great improvement there tristate capital holdings inc tsc corrected transcript q2 earnings call 22jul2021 the capital weve raised is now deployed and starting to generate meaningful returns we continue to be very thoughtful and flexible around capital strategies we dont necessarily need to raise capital before yearend and wed be fine starting with the current levels in terms of the balance sheet composition loan growth and where capital sits having said that well continue to look at opportunities to raise capital in what we would describe as a very economical and most efficient way with a continued focus on the shareholder given the market conditions subdebt could be a very attractive form of that additional capital given where rates are and as you know you raise that to the holding company you push it down to the bank and it counts as tier so no immediate plans to access the capital markets but its something were looking at as the coming quarters play out brian s fetterolf a president chief executive officertristate capital bank directortristate capital holdings inc tristate capital holdings inc yeah and i think i would add that tim used the statement what our primary job is our mission is and so we saw it as obviously having raised million in a pretty rapid time period in again taking the moments in time to realize that we were going to have some pretty significant growth opportunities which we would consider better than the market or better than the industry and we knew that we needed to take that time to invest and so we could be there for those opportunities so were certainly bringing those to bear and we viewed it as part of our job on a riskadjusted basis responsible growth basis to deploy that capital as quickly as possible to basically cover the lag on capital raises so were very happy with where weve done it if you look at the asset growth relative to for example loan to deposit ratio is is clearly reflective of our ability to raise deposits and deploy that into other assets that asset mix could give us some flexibility as well as how we look at funding the loans at any particular time and weve talked about it before from an investment perspective staying very high quality in relatively short duration so again our goal is to be as agile as possible between funding and capital and asset and balance sheet management so we have some flexibility in there as david pointed out timing but certainly being opportunistic we have some historic opportunities ahead on the growth side probably the capital if we wanted to pursue that in the subdebt space and otherwise just to manage our balance sheet matt olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks guys thats all for me congrats on the quarter james f getz a chairman president chief executive officer tristate capital holdings inc thanks
