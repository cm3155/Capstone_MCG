time i would like to turn the call over to jpmorgan chases chairman and ceo jamie dimon and chief financial officer jeremy barnum mr barnum please go ahead jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thank you and good morning everyone starting on page one the firm reported net income of billion eps of and revenue of billion with an rotce of touching on a couple of highlights in ccb we ranked number one in retail deposit share for the fourth straight year in cib both ib fees and markets revenue were notably up yearonyear reflecting strength across the franchise in awm we had record quarterly revenues and record longterm flows now turning to page two for the firmwide results the firm reported revenue of billion up billion or yearonyear nii exmarkets was up million or driven by the impact of jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment higher revolving balances in card and higher wholesale deposit balances predominantly offset by lower deposit balances in banking wealth management and in deposit margin compression nir exmarkets was up billion or but excluding the prioryears net investment securities losses it was up on higher asset management and investment banking fees and markets revenue was up million or yearonyear expenses of billion were up million or yearonyear driven by compensation including revenuerelated compensation and growth in employees partially offset by lower legal expense and credit costs were billion reflecting net chargeoffs of billion and a net reserve build of billion which included a million in consumer primarily in card and million in wholesale net chargeoffs were up million yearonyear predominantly driven by card on to balance sheet and capital on page we ended the quarter with a cet1 ratio of flat versus the prior quarter as net income and oci gains were offset by capital distributions and higher rwa this quarters rwa reflects higher lending activity as well as higher client activity and market moves on the trading side we had billion of net common share repurchases this quarter which in part reflects the deployment of the proceeds from the share from the sale of visa shares as we have previously mentioned now lets go to our businesses starting with ccb on page ccb reported net income of billion on revenue of billion which was down yearonyear in banking wealth management revenue was down year onyear reflecting deposit margin compression and lower deposits partially offset by growth in wealth management revenue average deposits were down yearonyear and sequentially were seeing a slowdown in customer yieldseeking activity including in cd volumes and expect deposits to be relatively flat for the remainder of the year client investment assets were up yearonyear driven by market performance and we continue to see strong referrals of new wealth management clients from our branch network in home lending revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher nii partially offset by lower servicing and production revenue turning to card services auto revenue was up yearonyear driven by higher card nii on higher revolving balances card outstandings were up due to strong account acquisition and the continued normalization of revolve and in auto originations were billion down while maintaining strong margins and highquality credit expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher field and technology compensation as well as growth in marketing in terms of credit performance this quarter credit costs were billion driven by card and reflected net charge offs of billion up million yearonyear and a net reserve build of million predominantly from higher revolving balances next the commercial investment bank on page the cib reported net income of billion on revenue of billion ib fees were up yearonyear and we ranked number one with yeartodate wallet share of in advisory fees were up benefiting from the closing of few large deals underwriting fees were up meaningfully with debt up and equity up primarily driven by favorable market conditions in light of the positive momentum throughout the year were optimistic about our pipeline but the ma regulatory environment and geopolitical situation are continued sources of uncertainty payments revenue was billion up yearonyear driven by fee growth and higher deposit balances largely offset by margin compression moving to markets total revenue was billion up yearonyear fixed income was flat reflecting outperformance in currencies emerging markets and lower revenue in rates equities was up reflecting strong performance across regions largely driven by a supportive trading environment in the us and increased latequarter activity in asia securities services revenue was billion up yearonyear largely driven by fee growth on higher market levels and volumes expenses of billion were jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 down yearonyear with lower legal expense predominantly offset by higher revenuerelated compensation and growth in employees as well as higher technology spend average banking payments loans were down yearonyear and down sequentially in the middle market and large corporate client segments we continue to see softness in both new loan demand and revolver utilization in part due to clients access to receptive capital markets in multifamily while we are seeing encouraging signs in loan originations as longterm rates fall we expect overall growth to remain muted in the nearterm as originations are offset by pay off activity average client deposits were up yearonyear and sequentially primarily driven by growth from large corporates in payments and securities services finally credit costs were million driven by higher net lending activity including in markets and downgrades partially offset by improved macroeconomic variables then to complete our lines of business awm on page asset wealth management reported net income of billion with pretax margin of for the quarter revenue of billion was up yearonyear driven by growth in management fees on higher average market levels and strong net inflows investment valuation gains compared to losses in the prioryear and higher brokerage activity partially offset by deposit margin compression expenses of billion were up yearonyear predominantly driven by higher compensation including revenuerelated compensation and continued growth in our private banking advisor teams as well as higher distribution fees and legal expense for the quarter longterm net inflows were billion led by fixed income and equities and in liquidity we saw net inflows of billion aum of trillion and client assets of trillion were both up driven by higher market levels and continued net inflows and finally loans were up quarteronquarter and deposits were up quarteronquarter turning to corporate on page corporate reported net income of billion revenue was billion up billion yearonyear nii was billion up million yearonyear predominantly driven by the impact of balance sheet mix and securities reinvestment including from prior quarters nir was a net gain of million compared with a net loss of million in the prior year predominantly driven by lower net investment securities losses this quarter expenses of million were down million yearonyear to finish up lets turn to the outlook on page we now expect nii exmarkets to be approximately billion and total nii to be approximately billion our outlook for adjusted expense is now about billion and given where we are in the year we included on the page the implied fourth quarter guidance for nii and adjusted expense and note that the nii numbers imply about million of markets nii in the fourth quarter on credit we continue to expect the card net chargeoff rate to be approximately so to wrap up were pleased with another quarter of strong operating performance as we look ahead to the next few quarters we expect results will be somewhat challenged as normalization continues but we remain upbeat and focused on executing in order to continue delivering excellent returns through the cycle and with that lets open the line for qa jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 question and answer section operator thank you please stand by our first question will come from the line of jim mitchell from seaport global securities you may proceed jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning so jeremy as you highlighted full year nii guidance implies a sizable drop in q4 nii ex markets about so can you just maybe discuss what are the largest drivers of the sequential decline including any initial thoughts on deposit behavior and pricing since the 50basis point cut and since its related ill just throw out my followup question i realize the forward curve is moving around a lot but since dan brought it up a month ago can you frame how youre thinking about the nii trajectory for thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure jim ill try to answer both questions together to the best of my ability so as we sit here today the biggest single driver of the sequential decline is in fact that were expecting is in fact the yield curve so that yield curve has changed a little bit since daniel made his comments at the conference earlier in the quarter but not that significantly in terms of deposit balances which is obviously another important factor here in light of the fed starting the cutting cycle it feels to us like right now as i mentioned in my prepared remarks for consumer were pretty much in the trough right now as we speak when you look at yieldseeking behavior that has come down quite a bit so thats no longer as much of a headwind all else being equal and then if you look at checking account balances those have been pretty stable for some time which we see as an indication that consumers are kind of done spending now their cash buffers so thats kind of supportive for consumer deposit balances and in that context the other relevant point is the cd mix where with the rate cuts coming we expect cd balances to price down with pretty high betas and probably the cd mix actually peaking around now and then as we move to wholesale weve actually already been seeing a little bit of growth there and when you combine that with the sort of increasing view that many people in the market have that its likely that the end of qt will be announced sometime soon thats also a little bit supportive for deposit balances so maybe ill well i guess then you also asked me a little bit about next year so i guess one thing to say right is that we did have a sequential increase in nii this quarter and as you may recall at investor day i said that there was some chance that we would see sequential increases followed by sequential declines and that people should avoid kind of drawing the conclusion that we hit the trough when that happens so thats essentially exactly what were seeing now but from where we sit now given the yield curve assuming the yield curve materializes obviously we do see a pretty clear picture of sequential declines in nii ex markets but the trough may be happening sometime in the middle of next year at which point the combination of balances card revolve growth and other factors can return us to sequential growth obviously were guessing its pretty far out in the future and well give you formal guidance on all this stuff next quarter but i think that gives you a better framework to work with jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 all right thanks a lot jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks operator thank you next we will go to the line of steven chubak with wolfe research you may proceed steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so jeremy jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co good morning steve steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi how are you so i do want to ask on expenses just in light of some of the comments that daniel had made recently just noting that consensus expense forecast for next year looked a little bit too light i believe at the time it was just below billion if we adjust for the onetimers this year that would suggest a core expense base thats just below billion so pretty healthy stepup in expenses i know youve always had a strong commitment and discipline around investment just want to better understand where those incremental dollars are being deployed and just which investments are being prioritized in particular looking out to next year jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure so good question and i agree with your numbers i agree with the way youve normalized this year for the onetime type of significant items and also where the consensus was when daniel made his comments and while were at it i would also just remind you on the nii comments at the time the consensus for this year was billion and for next year it was billion so that was implying at the time a sequential decline of billion it was because we felt that decline wasnt big enough that we made the comments that we made so happy to expand more on that but anyway to expenses yeah so if you start for the sake of argument with a base of billion obviously inflation is normalizing and obviously were always trying to generate efficiencies to offset inflation but that having been said if you assume for the sake of argument on that base thats a few billion dollars right out of the gate that were working against so thats one thing the other thing is that we have continued to execute on our growth strategies this year so theres a not insignificant amount of annualization you cant quite see that in the fourth quarter numbers because of the seasonality of incentive comp but if you were to strip that out you would see probably some sequential increases and so ph some annualization as an additional headwind the other thing thats worth noting is that we do expect fees and volumerelated businesses to grow next year and so all else being equal that would come with a higher expense loading so when you assemble all of those that goes a long way to explain why sort of that consensus number thats slightly below billion just seemed light jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 in terms of priorities and investments really nothing has changed like the strategy hasnt changed the strategy hasnt changed and the plans havent changed and were just kind of executing with the same longterm perspective that weve always had i would note that relative to nii obviously were in the third quarter now not the fourth quarter and in the old days we did used to give you the guidance until investor day in late february so we will give you formal expense guidance next quarter for both well for expenses and nii next quarter but especially on expenses we are in the middle of the budget cycle right now so we probably have a little less visibility there than we do at the margin on nii james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and can i just give you just a view of expense a little bit when you call expenses very often i call investments if you actually go back to investor day youll see that were adding private bankers in asset wealth management were adding etf in asset wealth management were adding private bankers in international private banking were going chase wealth management weve added some branches across the united states of america we have very huge opportunities for innovation economy that takes bankers and certain technology stuff like that our goal is to gain share and everything we do we get really good returns on it so i look at that these are opportunities for us these are not expenses that we have to actually punish ourself on and we do get and we show you kind of extensively cost and productivity on various things and also ai is going to go up a little bit and i would put that as a category that just is going to generate great stuff over time steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thank you both for the color just a quick followup for me just drilling down into nii it appears you redeployed a fair amount of cash or excess reserves at the fed into securities we saw the yield expand which was encouraging despite the pressure at both the long end and sofr contraction in the quarter i was hoping you could just speak to your appetite to extend duration in this environment i know that youve had some aversion to that in the past but do you anticipate redeploying additional excess liquidity just amid the expectation for deeper rate cuts james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah sure so on extending variations steve you know this obviously but i just think its important to say that all else equal extending duration doesnt change expected nii if you assume that the policy rate follows the forwards right so point one point two indiscernible the curve remains inverted and so even if you dont believe that the policy rate follows the forwards extending right now is actually a headwind to shortterm nii like that wouldnt be a consideration for us either way but i just think thats worth saying for the broader audience its quite different from the situation that you have on the numbers indiscernible james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co at so right jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah now so when we think of the question of extending duration and really managing duration right now a couple things to say so obviously a lot of different versions of duration but one number that we disclose is the ear when the 10q comes out youll see that that number is a little bit lower itll come down from billion to about billion if our current estimates are correct thats for a number of reasons some of which are passive but some of those are active choices to extend duration a little bit and in the end the choice to manage and extend duration is really about balancing the volatility of nii against protecting the company from extreme scenarios on either side and so right now if we wanted to extend as a result of indiscernible different factors we certainly could we have the capacity inside the portfolio but for now were comfortable with where we are james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co and the one thing i can assure you is the forward curve will not be the same forward curve in six months steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc well said well thank you so much for taking my questions jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks steve operator thank you next we will go to the line of erika najarian from ubs you may proceed erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc my first question and thank you very much for answering all the nii questions so far jeremy is just i guess another followup as you can imagine once daniel said what he said on stage in september everyone is trying to figure out the overunder for net interest income next year so maybe a twopart first question the second being inspired by what jamie just said number one nii is expected to be down sequentially in fourth quarter i think yearoveryear in consensus has it down from your new level so it sounds like consensus still has room to come down and based on the forward curve jeremy it could be a little bit worse yearoveryear than the fourth quarter sequential rate but that being said as jamie noted we have no idea what the curve is going to look like right its gyrated so much and so as we think about the curve is it better for jpmorgan to have more cuts in the short end but steepness or less cuts but a little bit of a flatter curve jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co right okay you threw a curve ball at the end there erika i wasnt expecting that to be the end of your question but let me answer the beginning of your question and then ill also answer the end of your question so we see the current consensus for nii exmarkets to be currently at billion which is obviously lower than it was jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 at the conference earlier in the quarter so were happy to see that move a little bit more in line to us that still looks a little toppy but its definitely in the ballpark now that consists of i already mentioned previously that we sort of expect the nii trough sometime in the middle of the year so you can kind of assemble the parts youve got a fourth quarter run rate youve got some sequential declines youve got a trough in the middle of the year and youve got a rough ballpark for the full year so you can imagine that the trough probably is a little lower than those numbers and then to the extent that growth revolve resumes in the back half of the year in both deposit balances and the ongoing tailwind of card revolve although that tailwind will be a little bit less than you might have otherwise thought i mean sorry a little bit less than it was this year but still a tailwind obviously the mix of those things will play out in different ways and as you point out who knows what the yield curve will wind up doing but on our current assumptions on the current yield curve and remembering that were in the third quarter now so were doing this kind of early thats what we think james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co can i just say something first of all next time lets just give them the damn number i dont want to spend all the time on these calls like going through what theyre guessing what nii is going to be next year can i just also point out that nii all things being equal is a number but all things are never equal and the yield curve if you have a recession the effect of the yield curve will be very different than if you have continued growth and there are decisions that are made nonstop by us and the things that happen in the marketplace and i think we spend too much time on just this irrelevancy so you get a model a number in your model and so its going to be less than billion next year probably not a lot we dont know we dont know the environment jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co good okay now to your question about the ear so a few things to say in there so as i already mentioned when that comes out itll show a number around billion a very important thing to say is as you know the experience of this rate cycle has been that our empirical ear is meaningfully higher than our modeled ear which is what we disclosed and the main reason for that is that retail deposit betas have in actuality been lower than the modeled deposit betas so as a starting point you have to kind of adjust that ear number to be bigger than the reported number for those and a few other reasons actually theres some nuances around how the dollar nondollar sensitivity interacted and then theres your question which is a little bit about the frontend versus the backend so what you see is that actually the frontend ear has gotten smaller and most of the ear is now in the back end so its definitely the case that all else being equal a steeper curve is better for us but i think what i would also say is that this kind of empirical versus theoretical adjustment is disproportionately in the front end so therefore in order to answer your question i would say yes we want a steeper curve but having the fed cut more than whats currently in the yield curve is definitely at the margin for the context of next years numbers a headwind would be a headwind for us we remain asset sensitive to fed cuts erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc and if i can ask my second question and jamie i completely understand your frustration and to be fair your longterm shareholders really dont care about whether its billion or billion right they care about your return on equity to that end i mean its insane how much capital you generate each quarter basis points this jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 quarter and so beyond the standard boilerplate questions youre going to get on buyback and organic growth yada yada dividend increases how should we think about jpmorgan deploying this capital i mean the world is generally your oyster right youre dominant already and you could use this capital to further enhance your business and again beyond that boilerplate conversation that you always get every quarter how should your shareholders think about how youre thinking about the opportunities to deploy this capital jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co okay first of all when you say dominant id be very careful on that weve got some very tough competition different in different countries different around the world fintech companies direct lenders and ph msp i want to give you a very specific comment on direct lending and stuff like that so our goal is always to serve our clients and when i talk about some of these expenses that is a deployment of capital and its a deployment in a different way if you open branches you initially experience an expense but down the road you need capital to support the deposits same for the innovation economy same for private bankers et cetera if you look at it roughly we have about a minimum bps of excess capital and for me its not burning a hole in my pocket i look at it as you own the whole company and you cant properly deploy it now is perfectly reasonable to wait and ive been quite clear that i think the future could be quite turbulent and asset prices in my view in life youve got to take a view sometimes are inflated i dont know if theyre extremely inflated or a little bit but i prefer to wait we will be able to deploy it our shareholders will be very well served by us waiting and same thing with deploying capital we can go buy billion mortgages increase our net income by a couple billion tomorrow we dont make decisions like that the most important thing we do is serve our clients well build a technology and do things like that and we ph also dont know what the real excess capital is yet so were a little patient were going to be a little patient and wait and itll be fine and so thats where we are and thats not going to change and if it changes well let you know we do talk to a lot of shareholders and they understand that buying stock back at more than two times tangible book value is not necessarily the best thing to do because we think well have better opportunities to redeploy it or to buy back at cheaper prices at one point markets do not stay high forever erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co one last thing cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world and you see my friend warren buffett stockpiling cash right now i mean people should be a little more thoughtful about how were trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company operator thank you our next question comes from glenn schorr from evercore isi you may proceed glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much and so glad jamie didnt say what he was about to say because thats the answer to this question so weve seen a couple more banks entering partnerships with alternative managers weve seen jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 limited loan growth for a few years now marketrelated also limited flows into fixed income funds yet plenty of growth in private credit in general and youre one of the best asset managers on the planet but in my view less dominant in all things private credit so maybe you could talk about what things youre working on and why thats too narrow of a view of your ability to serve all parts of clients lending needs not just the public markets and public lending side thanks james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so let me take time to cover this one because obviously it has become very important people talking about how theyre growing and partnering and things like that and so first and foremost im going to talk about very strategic and then very tactical i think theyre both important first and foremost we are here to give our clients an agnostic view of the world and what the best product and services are for them therefore when a client comes in we will offer them both direct lending ourselves and syndicated lending or other specialized kind of lending and they all have pluses and minuses so direct lending could be done faster maybe simpler covenants unit tranche it is more expensive and youre just seeing a little things go back and forth between syndicated lending and direct lending but were going to offer the clients basically whats in their best interest and tell them what those products are indiscernible we mentioned before in the past that we allocated billion of capital to make direct loans weve actually deployed a lot of capital some of those have already been paid off some indiscernible so we are going to do it directly and we are going to billion could be billion or billion not indiscernible today i will say today were extending we will do million we will do billion we will do more billion well do it solehanded or well do it with partners very importantly we are not going to allocate ourselves to one partner so we have i think weve announced a bunch of colenders but that just creates more flexibility and more size were not going to use that flexibility to slow it down have to get permission for everybody because like i said jpmorgan could underwrite it and own it like a bridge loan and syndicate it after the fact and were going to use our own risk measures and stuff like that again all in the service of the client and making sure were offering them the best thing and were going with different strategies were not going to tie ourselves exclusively to one capital provider i think that would limit what we could offer our clients probably we could be more pricecompetitive we could do some very specific thing and not the solution indiscernible the thirdparty capital provider thats our strategy were going to be there were going to do it and were going to do it in spite of the fact theres capital arbitrage taking place so if you look at the arbitrage today where a bank has to hold for things indiscernible they are dramatically different thats a disadvantage but we had those disadvantages in other businesses for a long time we are going to do whats right for the client remember when we do business with a client we also get other revenues off of them so it isnt just the loan we look at the whole relationship so were quite comfortable if we can compete i just announced much bigger lending platforms and sizes and stuff like that so i hope were ph going to press us on they heard this too glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi all right thanks for all that jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 operator thank you our next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy from rbc capital markets your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning jeremy and good morning jamie jeremy when you guys look at your current capital ratios theyre obviously very healthy can you guys give us some color on the new basel iii we dont know what the specifics are but as vicechair barr touched on some of the specifics it looks like capital requirements for yourself and your peers will come down a fair amount from the original proposal how are you guys thinking about that do you have any insights on how much it may fall from the original proposal to where you are today james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah when i said were at bps of excess that is assuming barrs speech that the goes to or whatever it is more itll be more than that because there are other factors involved now i was just giving the minimum excess capital in my view it would be more up but it is what it is and well wait to see the final numbers jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co but gerard just maybe to give you a bit of color so yeah obviously everyone paid a lot of attention to that speech it was an important speech but in the end we actually just really need to see the proposal because the details matter a lot for this stuff and so our focus is on hoping to see the proposal so that we can process the detail and continue advocating as appropriate i note that you talk about requirements coming down relative to what was originally proposed which was obviously true per the speech but i do think we need to be a little bit careful not to fall into the trap of saying that thats like progress just because the original proposal was so dramatically higher than what anyone thought was reasonable and i would remind you which you obviously know that before this proposal came out it was our position strongly felt that our thenprevailing capital requirements were if anything already more than we needed so weve got a long way to go here and i think our position which jamie has been articulating very consistently is that they need to get it right with the right amount of work and importantly do it holistically so its not just rwa its rwa its gsib its scb its ccar so thats really what we feel strongly about james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co we just want the numbers to be done right and justified if they had to go up we would be fine with that too we just think they should be done with real diligence and real thought and a little bit of thought about costbenefit what it does to the economy where it pushes lending and things like that so were anxiously awaiting to see the actual detail because thats whats going to make all the difference gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup in lieu of this excess capital and your comments a moment ago about direct lending you look at your current cash and marketable securities on a riskweighted asset basis you put it in your presentation of course trillion average loan is trillion when the dust settles you know what your capital requirements are can you frame out for us levering up the excess capital with more loans is that a path jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 that might be considered over the next two or three years relative to where you are on a mix basis i know youre going to grow your loans but im talking about the mix james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co absolutely positively not loans are an outcome of doing good business we want to do good business if it grows our balance sheet were fine jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co and i do think gerard it depends a lot on what type of loans youre talking about right so i think in the end as jamie says like its capital were going to deploy it ideally to grow the franchise organically and that could include loans that are almost good loans on a standalone basis as well as loans that are part of an overall relationship what were getting other revenue as part of that so its the same strategy that weve always had but i wouldnt think of it as like excess capital to be deployed against a particular product i would think of it as its there for a rainy day lets hope the environment doesnt deteriorate a lot but if it does well be ready and there will be opportunities hopefully to deploy it against a client franchise or against a stock and if not well return it but not now gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate the color and candor as always thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank you may proceed matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning so lower rates was supposed to drive a pickup in loan growth and conversion of some of these investment banking pipelines obviously we just had one cut and its early but any beginning signs of this in terms of the interest in borrowing more and again conversion of the banking pipeline jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co i would say matt generally no frankly with a couple of minor exceptions so i think its probably fair to say that the outperformance late in the quarter in investment banking fees was to a meaningful degree as i mentioned driven by dcm as well as to some degree driven by the acceleration of the closing of some ma transactions and i do think that some of that dcm outperformance is in the sort of types of deals that are opportunistic deals that arent in our pipeline and those are often driven by treasurers and cfos sort of seeing improvement in market levels and jumping on those so its possible that thats a little bit of a consequence of the cuts as i think i mentioned we did see for example a pickup in mortgage applications and a tiny bit of pickup in refi in our multifamily lending business there might be some hints of more activity there but these cuts were very heavily priced right the curve has been inverted for a long time so to a large degree this is expected so its not obvious to me that you should expect immediate dramatic reactions and thats not really what were seeing jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah and also in the debt markets rates came down spreads are quite low and markets are wide open so its kind of makes sense that people are taking advantage of that today those conditions may not prevail be the ongoing conditions late next year matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then specifically in the debit and credit card spend that you guys break out you had nice growth yearover year up flat qoq i know theres a lot of seasonality to i think last year it was up about but are you seeing any kind of changes in the consumer spend either the mix or some signs of a slowdown later in the quarter thank you jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co so i think what there is to say about consumer spend is a little bit boring in a sense because whats happened is that its become normal so meaning i mean i think were getting to the point where it no longer makes sense to talk about the pandemic but maybe one last time one of the things that you had was that heavy rotation into te as people did a lot of traveling and they booked cruises that they hadnt done before and everyone was going out to dinner a lot whatever so you had a big spike in te the big rotation into discretionary spending and thats now normalized and you would normally think that rotation out of discretionary into nondiscretionary would be a sign of consumers battening down the hatches and getting ready for a much worse environment but given the levels that it started from what we see it as is actually like normalization and inside that data were not seeing weakening for example in retail spending so overall we see the spending patterns as being sort of solid and consistent with the narrative that the consumer is on solid footing and consistent with the strong labor market and the current central case of a kind of nolanding scenario economically but obviously as we always point out thats one scenario and there are many other scenarios matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc got it thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of mike mayo from wells fargo securities you may proceed mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey jamie i think ive seen you comment on government this year more than any other time in your career and the august oped washington post davos youre talking about government i think it was this week or last week on bloomberg youre saying bank mergers should be allowed your bus tour in august you were asked which is my question now under what circumstances would you leave for government service and your answer then was i love what i do we get it you love what you do but under what circumstances would you consider government service it seems like youd be more likely to go now than in the past just based on the numerous comments that youve made is that right wrong whats your thinking jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think its wrong ive always been a american patriot my country is more important to me than my company and i think this government is very important to get this and if you look at the world today mike it is so important that we get things right for the whole geopolitical world im not just talking about the american economy and we try to participate in policy at the local level at the state level at the federal level at the international level to try to help thats our job we try to grow economies and things like that so nothing has changed in my view my opinion or my interest i just think its very very important that we try to help the government do a good job mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so if you were asked by the next administration to serve the country would you be open to considering it james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co i think the chance of that is almost nil and probably im not going to do it but ive always reserved the right i dont make promise to people i dont have to but no i love what i do i intend to be doing what im doing i almost guarantee ill be doing this for a long period of time or at least until the board kicks me out mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc let me take the flip side of that question for those of you who are worried about you leaving the other side of the question is we were on these calls the last couple of years youre saying the stock is overvalued and i think thats what youre saying youre saying the stock market is overvalued and therefore all stocks are overvalued and on the one hand you guys you highlight on this call ai tech market share gains high returns high capital so do you think in some ways when we think about the value of your price and your ability to do buybacks youre thinking more about an old school model for valuing your stock as opposed to a new school model that might put you in the category of more tech oriented firms especially as it relates to your progress with ai james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co listen youre making a very good point which is i think we have an exceptional company exceptional franchises and the price point at which you might buy the stock but im not that exuberant about thinking even tech valuations or any valuations will stay at these very inflated values and so im just were just quite patient in that and i think youre going to have to judge us over time about whether were done the right to do nothing and remember we could always do it we havent lost the money it didnt go away its sitting in store the only time that would be really wrong is if the stock runs way up weve got to buy at much higher prices and i just i would be a real skeptic about that happening operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is open ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah good morning i guess just wanted to followup you talked about private credit and the disruption to bank lending another area i would appreciate if you can address is weve been hearing a lot about the likes of jane jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 street and other market makers potentially disrupting fixed income trading is that a real risk and is there an opportunity for a firm like jpmorgan to actually compete on the private venue side on market making beyond traditional sort of ficc activity jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah ebrahim the way i would frame that is not as a risk but as a reality weve always emphasized in all of our businesses that we operate in an extremely competitive environment and that applies to and that competitive environment isnt limited to competing against banks or traditional financial institutions it extends in the consumer space to fintechs and in the market making space it obviously increasingly is extending to some of the types of firms that youre referring to now those firms are in many cases also clients and thats the same type of dynamic that you see for example in the private credit space that weve discussed before so theres no question that the ecosystem is changing youve got new competitors youve got changes in market structure new dynamics and as with any business we are innovating and adjusting and making sure that were prepared to compete in all the traditional ways and all the new ways of course there are some ways in which being a bank hinders our ability to do that and one of the arguments that weve made going back to the capital liquidity regulations is that when you come to the impact on the kind of us capital markets ecosystem which is the envy of the world its worked well in its current construct for a long time where some activities were inside the regulator perimeter and there was robust participation from unregulated capital of various sorts and a world where more and more of that activity gets pushed outside of bank market makers is a meaningful change to that structure that is untested and its unclear why you would want that and weve cautioned that if thats the intent of the regulations it should be intentional and wellstudied but in the meantime were going to adjust and compete to the best of our ability given the constraints of the current rule set james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co the previous answer on the private markets it remains to be seen how that develops there is a little bit of that and some people are talking about making more active things in private markets in some ways were well positioned for that too because for that you need liquidity marketmaking valuation buyers and sellers on both sides to create liquidity so that hasnt developed yet but we may have competition but well be there when the time comes and the second one is the public markets you have seen reports about you have deal inventories both corporate and treasuries and i do think thats capital but again we do it remember for clients so we are large market makers on both sides of the markets for clients in both credit and treasuries which is a little different than some of the other people just trading for their own account and so they are both competition from our standpoint but were there were going to do it were going to deploy more capital if we want and we would even deploy more capital at lower returns if we really had to do that to service clients so were very conscious of it there will be competition both sides as jeremy said we sat here years ago talking about trifurcation of the business and can we keep up with that and so far we have ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 got it and just one quick one and jeremy you i think mentioned qt stopping at some point we saw the repo sort of market spike at the end of september give us your perspective on just the risk of market liquidity shock as we move into yearend and do you have a view on how quickly fed should recalibrate qt or actually stop qt to prevent some ph loss thanks jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah its a good question ebrahim but i think youve kind of answered your own question in other words like the argument out there is that the repo spike that we saw at the end of this quarter was an indication that maybe the market is approaching that lowest comfortable level of reserves thats been heavily speculated about and recognizing that that number is probably higher and driven by the evolution of firms liquidity requirements as opposed to some of the more traditional measures and side point its just another reason why its important to look at the whole framework holistically when we think about the regulatory response of the events of two springs ago you dont want those types of spikes and it raises some questions about why there isnt more readiness to deploy into those types of disruptions albeit this one was relatively minor but in any case when you put all that together it would seem to add some weight to the notion that maybe qt should be wound down and that seems to be increasingly the consensus that thats going to get announced at some point in the fourth quarter so my only point was if you play that view through its a residual headwind for systemwide deposit growth which gets removed and thats one of the reasons that we feel that were probably in the trough of our deposit balances at the level of james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co so i just want to add a couple policy things here im not actually sure they can actually do that because you have inflationary factors out there partially driven by qe and also look at the volatility its not a risk to jpmorgan its a risk to the system and what banks have i already mentioned the constrained balance sheet a little bit so the banks will have trillions of dollars of cash and unable to deploy the repo markets and is it a good policy thing that every time that happens because you can do it very safely fully collateralized all things like that providing what i call flexible financing in the marketplace that that happens the fed has to step in every time i think that becomes a policy issue that every time theres some kind of fluctuation in the market people panic and the feds got to step in and provide stuff and can they always do that if you have a slightly more inflationary environment going forward so i think youve got to be very thoughtful about this and thats why we do think they should look at calibrating slr and ph eclr and cet1 all of these things particularly for this so my view is it is going to happen again i cant tell you exactly when but id be surprised if it doesnt happen again ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you both operator thank you our next question comes from the line of betsy graseck from morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 oh hi good morning jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co hey betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you hear me hello jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you hear me okay jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah we can hear you can you hear us betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc oh yes thank you so one for jeremy one for jamie jeremy and jamie sorry about the nii question im going to have but it is more than half your revenue so i kind of care about it but when im thinking about the trough and then the buildup qt ending deposit growth i mean thats part of the calculation for improvement as we go into right i should embed that outlook is that right and thats embedded in how youre thinking about it i know we dont have a number for you for nii for but it is in there right jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co yeah in other words it goes back to my prior point and to the point that i had in the prepared remarks about consumer deposit balances in particular betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co that theres lots of different offsetting factors right now right youve got the yield curve youve got card revolve youve got balances and balances have been a headwind we now see it as neutral and they could potentially become a tailwind later in the year and one of the potential reasons for that is one of the potential reasons for that is the potential end of qt but emphasize the word potential to jamies point you also obviously have a little bit of the fixed asset fixed rate asset reprice dynamics starting to flow through a little bit while were on nii just jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 to annoy jamie a little bit more i do want to make a point that i didnt get a chance to make previously which is theres a reason that we emphasize the implied fourth quarter run rate for the markets nii in the presentation which is that if you take that and you annualize it it gives you a launch point run rate which is significantly higher than whats currently in the consensus and obviously what weve seen this year and ill give you the concise version of my usual speech that changes in markets nii are almost always bottom line neutral and offsetting nir but for the purposes of trying to help you guys with your models i would just encourage you to recognize what that launch point is the number of cuts that are in the curve the fact that that number has historically and in the recent past has been quite liabilitysensitive so you can draw your own conclusions about what that should mean again shouldnt change the overall revenue expectation its just a balance sheet and income statement geography issue but just for the sake of helping you tidy up models i wanted to make that point betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and so daniels comments in september were on nii in total or nii exmarkets could you just clarify that jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co no those were core nii or nii ex so again reiterating at the time the consensus was billion the consensus was billion on nii ex and our point was that that number which remains an assetsensitive number indicated an insufficient amount of sequential decline yearonyear the current consensus as we see it for nii exmarkets is billion and as weve noted thats closer albeit maybe still a little bit toppy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay then one for jamie jamie we did talk already quite a bit about the capital that you have capital on store just wanted to understand how youre thinking about that opportunity set thats in front of you with regard to using it for potentially portfolio acquisitions i realize that depositories are not on the docket but we all know theres portfolios out there that might be looking for a home and could you give us a sense as to how interested you might be in acquiring assets at this stage james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co yeah so indiscernible asset acquisitions i mean i always want our people to be looking at those things and thinking about those things and if you listen to what im saying about my question about the world its hard for me to say that were going to be in the market to buy credit assets betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc what about loans indiscernible james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 but creating indiscernible assets to help clients thats a whole different matter because when it comes to clients we earn credit assets spread and we usually have other stuff if our bankers can deploy capital that way of course we want to do more and our cio could deploy capital in multiple ways we would probably do more and we ask all the time can we do more in affordable housing can we do more in things were actually quite comfortable and yeah if we could find ways to deploy capital we would be happy to do that but put us in the closest category betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and what about like private label credit card for example james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc im just wondering about private label credit card for example is that something that would help clients james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co almost no chance well but having its very important when i say that i always tell the management team secondguess me i mean weve done private label i know what it is weve been there i have a lot of issues with it but is it possible its going to be different in one day in a different yeah its possible so i dont want to cut it off marianne lake says to me jaime i think clearly the worlds changed were going to change but right now wed say no theres no chance betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thank you so much operator thank you our final question will come from saul martinez with hsbc your line is open saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc hey good morning im not going to ask about a specific nii in but i did want to delve into the how to think about your deposit margin and volume dynamics in the ccb over the next few years you have seen a decent amount of pressure in the deposit margin down about basis points as deposit balances have come down so it put some pressure on deposit nii but deposit margins are still well above where they were when rates were outleveled that are consistent with where the forward curve now has been going so i guess how do we think about both volumes and margin dynamics if rates do come down say to levels that are consistent with the forward curve i know the forward curve is likely going to be long but thats the reference point we have and conversely volume offset you mentioned jeremy the retail deposits becoming a tailwind jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 but i guess how much of a tailwind could they be especially as you are expecting to gain quite a bit of market share in retail deposits so just give us a sense of sort of the push and pull of these dynamics that really help drive the deposit the value of the deposit franchise jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co sure yeah thanks for the question saul and i think youve laid out the building blocks there already just for simplicity im going to try to answer your question without referring to the disclosed ccb deposit margin number just because that number is obviously the combination of the rate paid on the ccb deposits and the internal ftp into that and that is a complicated thing that evolves as a function of the modeling of the betas and other things so i think its actually more helpful to look at this simply from a firmwide perspective and look at the evolution of the rate paid in the context of the policy rates roughly and just set aside the duration management and all those sort of factors and i think when you do that what you see is weve been saying for a while that the deposit margin defined for these purposes is simply the difference between the policy rate and the weightedaverage rate paid of the consumer deposits was unsustainably high and that was going to have to correct one way or the other either deposits were going to reprice at the product level through checking and savings andor we were going to see a ton of internal migration ie growth in the cd mix andor we would see a lower policy rate so as we sit here right now of course we make pricing decisions in the context of market competition at any given moment looking at what the environment is for deposits but we have not needed to reprice in order to retain primary bank relationships which was also our core strategy we were never going to chase sort of the hot money at the margin weve leaned in heavily to cds and gotten to the current level of cd mix and thats been a good strategy and from where we sit now we now have the margin coming down as a result of the policy rate coming down it seems that that puts us in a pretty comfortable position from a pricing perspective we think the cd mix has probably peaked now on the way down its not going to go back down to zero where it was at the beginning of the cycle thats an important thing to realize so all else equal that creates a little bit of margin compression and then through all of that obviously a lower yield environment should mean that theres a little bit less outflow from consumer deposits as i mentioned were seeing a lot less yieldseeking behavior so then when you overlay on to that what you mentioned which is our longterm share growth in ccb deposits in no small part as a function of the brand strategy and the buildout and the fact that only about a quarter of our top markets in ccb are at that share number so we believe theres big opportunity to grow the rest of it and be on track at the type of average annual share growth of the order of basis points or basis points that weve seen historically thats how you kind of assemble a tailwind from normalized deposit margin and balance growth in consumer james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co jeremy correct me if you think im wrong the abnormal time period was when rates were between and or other than that if youre looking at say what are normal deposit margins in the normal banking business forget people going after really hot money if that happens its to jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co absolutely yeah we agree jpmorgan chase co jpm corrected transcript q3 earnings call 11oct2024 saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc okay thats helpful so it sounds like youre a little bit above that but theres still some pressure but youre not dramatically above those levels james dimon a chairman chief executive officer jpmorgan chase co indiscernible very good returns in business in both banking wealth management were growing market share and when we build branches and stuff like that we dont necessarily assume current margins we look at what would be normal margins over time and were very comfortable building very nicely in the industry overall saul martinez q analyst hsbc securities usa inc yes got it okay thats helpful thanks a lot thats all i got jeremy barnum a chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks saul jeremy barnum chief financial officer jpmorgan chase co thanks everyone james dimon
