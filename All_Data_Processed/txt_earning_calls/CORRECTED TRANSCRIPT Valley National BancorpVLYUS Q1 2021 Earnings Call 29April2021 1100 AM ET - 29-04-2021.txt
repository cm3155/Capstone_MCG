additional details on the financial results before opening the call to your questions in the first quarter of we reported net income of million and earnings per share of for the third consecutive quarter this represents the highest level of quarterly earnings in valleys entire history return on average assets was reflecting net interest margin expansion stable expenses and a lower provision for loan losses looking forward we expect fee income to rebound continue net interest margin strength and strong loan growth this should drive further positive operating leverage strong financial performance and shareholder value over time on last quarters call i mentioned our expectation for midsingle digit nonppp loan growth in in the first quarter we generated annualized growth in nonppp loans this growth was welldiversified from an asset class and geographic perspective on the commercial side nonmultifamily cre and ci were strong contributors and auto loans increased nicely in the consumer portfolio however the net growth numbers dont tell the whole story in the first quarter of valley originated over billion of nonppp loans this represents the single highest quarter for loan originations in our history our commercial loan pipeline now stands above billion which is also the highest level in our history these statistics represent what we can control we can build commercial and retail relationships and drive meaningful activity by providing premier service we have less control over the pace of payoffs which remain elevated and have weighed on our net loan growth still we feel very wellpositioned to achieve our loan growth goals through the course of the year we mentioned in the fourth quarter call that were increasing our ci lending staff in florida by or approximately individuals of those lenders are now on board with half focused on middle market and the other half on business banking we have also added eight new ci lenders in the northeast spread across our middle market business banking and healthcare segments we will continue to selectively augment our lending team to ensure we are positioned to capitalize on growth opportunities throughout all of our markets our talent is supported by the technology tools that enable nimble responsiveness and premier service from a balance sheet perspective we have the capital and deposit funding to support the loan growth that we expect to achieve as the economy continues to rebound geographically we saw more than of our commercial loan growth come out of florida during the quarter activity has been particularly strong in palm beach broward county jacksonville and orlando where previous hires attracted from larger competitors are paying dividends there is a real momentum here that will continue to be supplemented by the additional hires i referenced earlier we have strategically built a loan portfolio and lending team that is welldiversified across asset classes and geographies our significant market presence and stable northeast markets is supplemented by a robust valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 commercial lending operation in more growthoriented florida markets future growth is expected to remain well balanced between these markets we believe this differentiated approach sets us apart from many of our regional peers and will ensure a consistent pool of growth opportunities remains available to us with that said i also want to mention some important strides we have made as corporate citizens during we continued to promote social and economic justice we emphasized inclusion among our associates and communities by expanding our diversity equity and inclusion initiatives and partnering with local justicefocused organizations our communities remain at the heart of what we do in our employees volunteered almost hours of their time and as an organization we gave nearly million to local charities weve also developed a new community lending group that will focus on serving the unique needs of underrepresented firms across all of our markets we are proud to have received an outstanding community reinvestment act rating from the occ in we also established an esg council to further our approach to environmental social and governance issues our esg council will guide our efforts to practice sound esg stewardship with respect to our employees shareholders customers and overall society we will also use esg best practices to mitigate the risks presented by these issues as we pursue our longterm strategic initiatives for more details on these efforts and our recent successes i welcome you to view our corporate social responsibility report on our website we understand the importance of these issues and well continue to devote time and resources to ensuring we fulfill our potential as a wellrespected and leading corporate citizen as you can tell there is plenty going on at valley we are constantly evolving to meet the changing needs of our markets and our diverse constituents we continue to generate strong net interest margin performance and diverse loan growth opportunities we are very excited for the rest of the year and confident we will continue to drive strong financial performance and shareholder value with that id like to turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some additional financial highlights michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide you can see that valleys reported net interest margin increased to from in the fourth quarter of the majority of this increase was related to accelerated ppp loan forgiveness however net interest margin would have still increased basis point sequentially absent the effects of ppp this stability reflects continued earning asset mix shift as average cash balances declined and average loans increased modestly importantly much of the quarters loan growth occurred in march the impact on average balances and earnings will begin to emerge in the second quarter we continued to actively manage the funding side of the balance sheet and drove another basis point reduction in our interestbearing liability costs during the quarter this reflects lower deposit rates and a full quarters benefit from the fhlb borrowings prepayment that we executed in the fourth quarter as is typical the first quarters day count also had a modest negative impact on the reported margin during the quarter we utilized excess liquidity to fund the runoff of higher cost brokered deposits this trend continued into april and our average cash balance continues to decline with strong loan originations and select liability repricing opportunities our net interest income should grow as the year progresses absent the impact of ppp forgiveness volatility valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 you can see more detail regarding the impacts of ppp income on slide we estimate that ppp contributed basis points to the margin versus basis point in the fourth quarter as you can see in the bottom left we have an additional million forgiveness request pending approval by the sba all in approximately of our round and originations have now received or requested forgiveness through march we have recognized approximately million of ppp loan fee income since the inception of the program i will speak to the results of our round ppp origination shortly from an income perspective however as of march an additional million of ppp loan fees will be recognized as outstanding loans are forgiven or repaid slide outlines our interest rate positioning and the remaining opportunity to reprice liabilities over the next four quarters we have over billion of retail cds set to mature in the next two quarters at an average rate of around basis points we expect the majority of these funds will be retained in lower cost cds or transaction accounts at rates closer to basis points we also have additional opportunities on the borrowing side including the pending maturity of million of higher cost borrowings early in the third quarter of as a result of active balance sheet management and significant deposit growth our net interest margin has been extremely resilient over the last few years we remain modestly assetsensitive and expect to continue to outperform peers from a net interest margin perspective going forward slide illustrates the ongoing improvement in our funding profile total deposits increased another during the quarter fueled by a increase in noninterest bearing balances and a increase in other transaction balances continuing our recent experience cd balances declined during the quarter a portion of this run off was in brokered balances these dynamics contributed to the sequential basis point reduction in deposit costs from a total deposit growth perspective we have benefited from successful crosssell of deposit products into our commercial customer base our exceptional deposit growth positions us to fund the future loan originations that will result from our strong pipeline we continue to build out deposit products and services to further diversify our growth channels to this end we recently revamped our online account opening process and expect to add new digital deposit products in the coming months page provides an overview of the recent acceleration of online and mobile banking adoption among our customer base we continue to assess the performance of our physical delivery channels and look for opportunities to further enhance efficiency in our physical delivery as a reminder in we rolled out a pilot program to provide banking services to businesses and multistate operators in the cannabis space we took a differentiated approach of combining industryleading risk management with a value enhancing offering for our commercial customers as we exit our pilot phase we are positioned to capitalize on growth in the cannabis space as legislative support continues to build momentum we will update you on our progress as this business becomes material slide details our loan portfolio and origination trends over the last few quarters average loan yields were effectively flat during the quarter benefiting from elevated income from ppp forgiveness as ira mentioned we originated a record billion of nonppp loans during the quarter while origination activity has been robust in recent months elevated payoffs continue to weigh on net loan growth the pace of future loan payoffs is uncertain so we remain encouraged by our strong and diverse lending pipeline valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 the right side of page lays out the details around our round ppp activity we originated over million of new ppp loans over the last few months the average loan size in round is lower than our previous experience this contributed to a higher average processing fee of in round we continued to focus on minority and womenowned businesses in total the ppp experience has been extremely rewarding for valley we filled the need in our local communities and executed at a very high level our nps scores related to ppp have been extremely high and the level of differentiated service that we were able to provide has increased demand for our other products and services moving to slide we generated noninterest income of million for the quarter the reduction was driven by lower swap and residential mortgage gain on sale income we expect swap income to rebound to highsingle digits in the second quarter of with steady improvement from those levels for the remainder of the year gain on sale income should also improve to a highsingle digit level but could decline from that point given the expectation slowing refinance activity as the year progresses as we said on our previous call we do recognize that certain fee lines will ebb and flow with market conditions however enhancing fee income remains a strategic focus of our company we continue to explore less cyclical opportunities to develop business lines that will contribute to greater consistency and revenue diversity on slide you can see that our adjusted expenses were stable in the first quarter at million the quarter included over of expenses associated with seasonal snow removal our adjusted efficiency ratio ticked up to from in the fourth quarter with the increase reflecting the reduction in fee income during the quarter we remain focused on relative expense control and positive operating leverage since the first quarter of our revenue has grown at nearly two times the pace of expenses this trend is consistent over a longer horizon as well over the last five years our quarterly revenue has increased at an annual rate of which is more than two times the pace of annual expense growth in the same period looking forward we continue to explore opportunities to generate positive operating leverage and are building the talent and infrastructure to leverage our strong balance sheet with a focus on organic loan growth as this growth is realized we will continue to drive towards industryleading efficiency levels turning to slide you can see our credit trends for the past five quarters during the quarter we maintained our allowance for credit losses at of nonppp loans we recognized that renewed economic optimism has driven negative provision and reserve releases across the industry while we share this optimism our first quarter cecl model remained partially weighted to recessionary scenarios we revisit our model each quarter and given the economic tailwinds beginning to emerge as well as the successful pace of vaccine rollout it is possible that we increase the moodys baseline weighting going forward all else equal this could lower our future reserve levels our nonaccrual loan balances continued to hover around basis points of loans give or take accruing past dues declined to million from million in the prior quarter this represents the lowest absolute level of accruing past dues since the second quarter of while we remain conservative by nature our borrowers have been extraordinarily resilient throughout the pandemic during the quarter our active deferrals declined to million or of total loans versus in the fourth quarter additional detail on deferrals can be found in the appendix valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 as we have reiterated throughout the crisis valleys historical credit strength remains a distinguishing characteristic of our organization as a result we expect to outperform the industry on credit loss experience in any economic environment slide illustrates the consistent growth in our tangible book value and the continued improvement in our capital ratios tangible book value has increased in the last months driven by our increased earnings power our tangible common equity ratio increased to from in the fourth quarter adjusting for our billion of ppp loans tangible common equity would have been above on a yearoveryear basis we have also seen a significant improvement in our regulatory capital ratios which gave us the flexibility to redeem million of subordinated debt on april this tranche had been acquired from usab and carried a cost all else equal this would lower our total riskbased capital ratio by approximately basis points we expect to offset the majority of this impact with retained earnings during the second quarter with that ill turn the call back over to ira for some closing commentary ira d robbins president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks mike this quarter was highlighted by the continuation of our strong performance trends our net interest margin has been extremely resilient reflecting our active balance sheet management and loan and deposit tailwinds we continue to control expenses and drive positive operating leverage our capital levels are robust and we are positioned to drive significant organic growth on both sides of the balance sheet across our entire franchise this strong and consistent performance is the results of the performanceoriented culture that we have developed over the last few years there is a real momentum here at valley while we continue to evolve and refine our approach we are committed to remaining a highperforming institution for the benefit of all of our stakeholders with that id now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question coming from the line of steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan you line is open steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey good morning everybody ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp good morning steven michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc ira i wanted to start on online competition because weve been told for years that with customers now being able to move money more easily they could go online check rates that banks like yourself would have to pay closer to market rates for deposits and youre telling us that your basis points cds are going to be retained somewhere in the basis point range which is wellbelow what online players such as chime are paying so my question is are you as you move those rates down are you seeing customers move balances out of the banks to chime and other players that are just paying more or are customers staying with you ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp were definitely seeing a customer retention steve were actually seeing customer growth when we look at unit of accounts i know theres been a surge in deposits across the entire industry were focused on growth in households growth on what our customer experience looks like but on individual units i mean were up linked quarter on an annualized basis in unit of personal accounts were up on an annualized basis in business accounts and yearoveryear were up as well so weve seen a real positive trend continue across both business and consumer accounts our nps scores within the online banking channel is actually better than what we got within the branches so i think its a combination of having a terrific online banking experience as well as that relationship focus within the branches we tend to see a lot of our customers want the ability to bank online but want the safety and security to know that there is somebody that they have the ability to connect with so i think its a combination of a comprehensive strategy not an individual one and were seeing real core growth in our organization and its a focus i think on that customer experience steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 got you okay thats helpful and ira on customer sentiment you guys are in a very unique position because you have exposure to the northeast and florida right we know florida is much more open than new york and new jersey today can you contrast for us business sentiment amongst your customers in the northeast versus florida and maybe talk about what difference youre seeing in terms of them building own pipelines here thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure hey steven its tom iadanza i think as ira pointed out early in the presentation about of our production on the commercial side is coming out of florida and about of our growth is coming out of florida we still exhibit very stable growth in production in the northeast again across all ph orders of our business were more suburban than we are manhattan based here we are seeing higher ci growth today in the northeast because thats been our focus for the last four years here and were starting to see that ci growth in the south in the florida or alabama markets as we add staff down there pipelines are now for the most part i would say its of the pipeline is florida based on the commercial side is still new york new jersey more importantly or equally important is on the consumer we are now refinance to purchase but we have seen about a increase in the purchase portion down in florida over the last quarter so were starting to take advantage of that migration down on both a business and consumer side steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay but tom im trying to understand are you seeing a big difference in customer behaviors in florida today versus the northeast thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp from the standpoint of customers building inventory customers building whether its a real estate project very similar youre seeing a bit more activity in florida in different product categories its still retail youre still doing office down there youre still doing a lot of multifamily it is lower up here on that build than it is in florida and its lower up here on ci inventory build than it is in florida so there is more activity in florida steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got you okay and then final question for you ira its clear ma in the northeast is certainly percolated do you think that you can be competitive in your markets with roughly billion of assets or do you think you need to join many of these other banks that are jumping up to that billion billion billion asset threshold thanks ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks for the question look i think there is varying reasons as to why each organization looks at ma we have real strong organic growth thats taking place in our organization were focused on relationship banking model leveraged by technology not the other way around and as a result i think being focused from a strategic perspective we do have the ability with where we are today to continue to deliver outsized performance on an organic perspective valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 that said i think there is always opportunities when we look at ma and are there institutions both bank and nonbank that potentially would be accretive and help us accelerate some of the individual strategic objectives that weve outlined so to answer your question directly i think we are of an opportunistic size definitely to continue to grow the organization but that said i think if there is an opportunity to continue to grow via layering in some ma its something that we would be up into as well steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for taking my questions ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks steven operator and our next question coming from the line of frank schiraldi with piper sandler your line is now open frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co good morning just on the ira i think you reiterated midsingle digit loan growth but i just wanted to make sure that was messaging and then any bias one way or the other in terms of that growth rate for the full year just given how strong originations are even at start of the year thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah hey frank its tom again i think the singledigit growth given where our pipeline is today and that billion range which is probably above the prepandemic levels gives us confidence that well meet that level the only caution is the pullthrough will be lower theres much more competition much more loosening of terms one of the important components of us hitting our growth number is not to compromise our credit standards and our underwriting standards which we did not were still a very diverse growing in all regions all product type ci real estate still very granular average real estate loan is still in that million range average ci loan is still at million range were going to maintain those standards the impact of every bank being very hungry for loans might prevent us from hitting pulling through that full billion that were talking about additionally we have taken advantage of the aggressiveness in the market we exited about million of new york city multifamily loans that we acquired through the oritani acquisition non relationship lower yielding and moved out of that and still replaced and grew that frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay thanks and then just lastly from me on it seems like you can handle as much deposits in the door as you want how do we think about i know its a small piece of the overall franchise but if i think about the alabama portion of the footprint how could that change over time do you retain that how does the strategy there first of all what is the strategy now and how could that change over the nearterm valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp let me just maybe address the question first so maybe i would disagree a bit i dont think its easy to get the type of deposits that we want today i think anyone can grow deposits based on sort of surge deposits and based on not real relationships those are transactiontype deposits our growth in households our growth in relationships is something that we focused on i think when we looked at even from a ppp perspective we could have absolutely done more ppp we could have absolutely been on every single leader board when it came to ppp but it would have been inconsistent with our focus from a strategic perspective and making sure that we were relationship first and how we looked at growing the overall franchise so from our perspective its the individual liability side of the balance sheet the growth in households the growth in profitability those individual relationships that drives franchise value putting up unbelievable deposit numbers when theyre transaction and really dont really drive franchise value from our perspective i think as that layers into the alabama i think we look at it from a more holistic perspective are they additive to the organization when we think by stable funding base is there franchise value that comes out of that and today the answer is yes and we continuously reassess every single geography every single product we have within the organization to sit and say is this the best use of our capital is this the best use of our resources and is it providing the best franchise value to the overall organization frank schiraldi q analyst piper sandler co okay all right thank you ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks frank operator our next question coming from the line of zach westerlind with stephens your line is now open zach westerlind q analyst stephens inc good morning its zach westerlind covering for matt breese how are you guys doing ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp hey zach michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning zach zach westerlind q analyst stephens inc i just have two quick kind of ph modeling questions the first on the nim do you guys for the trajectory for the rest of the year do you guys see the nim having room to run higher valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp this is mike ill take a stab at that one when you look at the sequential change from fourth quarter to first quarter of basis points the two largest increases that drove that were the impact of ppp and the impact of our interest bearing liability cost reduction both of which we think are going to be robust going into the second quarter and i would say that the latter the interestbearing liabilities will continue into the third and fourth quarter and you can see that in our ip the other thing is the number of days was a negative drag on that sequential comparison and thats obviously going to improve in the second quarter so what im telling you is i think margin could actually as stated margin could actually be better than in the second quarter and then once all of the majority its not all but the majority of those ppp fees that are enhancing margin are taken through the income statement youll see a reduction in margin for that reason alone but we still have these other movers that were working on not the least of which is our interestbearing deposit costs which we still have more room zach westerlind q analyst stephens inc great thank you and then on expenses is million a good quarterly run rate michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah we feel pretty good that the adjusted expenses that weve put out million is fairly decent ongoing run rate zach westerlind q analyst stephens inc great thanks for taking my questions michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thanks zach operator our next question coming from the line of ken zerbe with morgan stanley your line is open ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc i was hoping just in terms of the acl ratio in the press release you guys mentioned that it looks like you boosted reserves related to certain commercial real estate loans can you just talk a little bit about that specifically like how meaningful was that valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp yeah it was a single loan i think you were referring to that we moved into our nonaccrual category its pretty small relative to the size of the portfolio michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp the biggest mover on our cecl reserve was clearly to weightings that we put on the moodys estimate so just to be real clear about the on the baseline which had previously been on s3 which is a recessionary scenario which had been previously and on s4 which is the prolonged slump within those components in the moodys estimates because of the way it works its less focused on the gdp number honestly but more focused on the u3 number because of the difference in u3 unemployment each one of those scenarios and so what our comments were meant to say is we really felt that was prudent going into the quarter thinking about the pace of the vaccine rollout there is a ton of uncertainty about it side effects was the economic rebound actually driven by fundamentals or was it being driven by a lot of government money thats just sloshing around in the economy so taking everything into its totality we thought that was the best approach and that resulted in us taking some measure of provision million in the first quarter so in our comments we said all things being equal we would expect that number to being somewhat reduced im not saying that will actually go to negative but absent loan growth its higher than what were projecting which would also drive a higher level of provisioning i think the bias will be towards a lower number ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay that now makes sense and then just tom in terms of mortgage banking obviously ph it felt like you expect to rebound in that next quarter can you just explain exactly what did happen with mortgage banking this quarter to drive the lower revenues thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp so our estimates were think of it this way were basically a fair value shop so our entire balance sheet is done using the fair value conventions and when you look at the way that works from an accounting perspective at the end of the quarter youre recording a number thats fair value of what you think the next quarter production is going to be and thats a function of interest rates so because the level of production has been somewhat challenged by the length of days that its taking to close mortgages and get them to the gses which typically were around days stretched out to based upon fte counts and just the sheer level of refinance activity plus a reduction in rates from the fourth quarter to the first quarter resulted in that fair value adjustment going down that production is still there and its going to be delivered and thats whats going to drive the second quarter number back up so in totality if you look over the entire period of time all the revenue will be the same its just a matter of which quarter its recognized in i know this is a tricky thing i appreciate the question but hopefully that explains it valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 ken zerbe q analyst morgan stanley co llc it does it helps all right thank you very much ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank you ken operator our next question coming from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush securities your line is open david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks a couple of questions a followup on the fee income similar to your discussion around the gain on sale and the dynamics around that on swap income you also guided to a rebound in the second quarter and then kind of stabilizing i was just curious what drives the variability in swap income from quartertoquarter is it a certain type of loan that you originate or is it based on the level of interest rate and interest rate movements that drives customers to hedge that movement michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah its essentially both i think we produced more ci in the first quarter and that tends to be shorterterm floating we did the same appropriate amount of fixed rate but the fixed rate has shortened in term to closer to fiveyear than longerterm horizon so typically five year and under were not swapping customers have an exit strategy on the asset so its really depends on the mix of the asset looking at whats in our pipeline is why we believe it will come back to traditional slightly higher levels in the upcoming quarter david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc got it thats helpful and then shifting gears you spoke a little bit about the cannabis business can you frame the opportunity how big it is and discuss how much of it is on the lending side versus the deposit side ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp look i think as anyone would test right now the opportunity is tremendous it really depends on how quickly the government goes ahead and puts through different legislation for us it was really more of a risk management focus and how we want to be proactive in addressing it as opposed to reactive we spent well over a year putting together risk management practices in place that made us comfortable that well be able to manage this risk appropriately as well as growing weve been very selective as to companies that weve targeted to do business with so right now its really on the deposit side were just beginning to target a little bit on some of the lending side but we think overall that the industry is something that would drive performance at valley well above peers and we think were going to be first in from any size perspective david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 great and geographically is that more in the florida market ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp no right now its largely in our new jersey footprint we are looking obviously to grow it into the other geographies that we currently have physical locations in david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc great thanks very much ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank you operator and our next question coming from the line of michael perito with kbw your line is open michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey guys thanks for taking my questions appreciate it ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp yes mike michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc obviously a lot has been asked and answered at this point i wanted to expand maybe on slide for a minute here the revamp or the relaunch of the deposit account online opening process i was wondering if you could maybe give us a little bit more color in terms of how much of your deposit accounts or incremental deposit accounts are being opened online today and where you think that could trend with kind of this new platform or hoping it could trend maybe just expand a little on kind of the economic impact of that right in terms of kind of the efficiencies that could be gained if more of your account opening moves online versus instore presumably ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp well give you i think we indiscernible a little more of a clarity and an update and well put together a more detailed slides next quarter on some of that but were seeing monumental growth within the via our digital channel today on a linked quarter basis versus where we were before both in volume as well as in unit of accounts that said tom really spearheaded with a gentleman by the name stuart cook who works for us on new online account opening platform that i would rival against anyone within the industry i think its minutes tom thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 yeah its minutes which includes all of the compliance checks to apply online open and fund within two days itll appear there its were using it now for a single online account but it will expand into several accounts and ultimately be the account opening process used across our footprint with the drivein more mobile users online users and less transactions being done at the branch itll allow our branches to be more focused on guidance and consulting type services especially with regards to a lot of the activity were seeing in our mortgage our residential mortgage product travis lan a senior vice president valley national bancorp and mike its travis when we said in the prepared remarks that it was recently revamped we mean that very honestly like its over the last couple of weeks which is why we dont we didnt put any real statistics in the deck but as you go forward as ira said well put more clarity around that in terms of numbers michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great no understood and so is it fair to assume that thats just on consumer account online opening side at this point i guess to toms point looking to expand thats other things like business in the future or is it both consumer and business online at this point thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp at this point its consumer it will be fully activated on a consumer accounts probably over the next two quarters and then by the end of the year it will be both consumer and commercial ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp mike i think the one important thing here is the way that weve structured this enables us to really lever this as a platform from growth across all different product types throughout the entire organization so its not dependent upon a thirdparty to make changes we have the ability inhouse to do really begin to drive a lot of this and we think this is a growth platform for us and once again i think its consistent with the technology strategy that we put forth to make sure we own the ability to drive that customer experience as opposed to a thirdparty owning that ability to drive the customer experience its a very differentiated model from what many of our peers are doing where theyre just layering in with the thirdparty whoever that may be to sit there and let them control what that experience looks like so we think it will be differentiated we think it will contribute to the growth we have within the entire organization and as tom mentioned its going to help us from an efficiency perspective as we think about what the physical experience should look like for many of our customers michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp and mike ill just ill finish this up by saying that from q1 of to q1 of business checking accounts increased and our personal checking accounts increased but that includes both online and inperson openings well figure out a way in the future to break that out for you i think thats what youre asking but it goes back to what ira said earlier that a lot of banks are just trying to fight to keep that even and theyre probably losing ground and whats happening here is were actually net positive very nicely net positive account growth valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp i mean on a unit basis on online we were up linked quarter versus where we were at first quarter so pretty big numbers and i think well do a pretty decent job next quarter giving you a little bit more details i think it is something thats a big driver here for us michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah no that would be great because obviously the big guys are disclosing like over of accounts are online thats not exactly clear whats in that number but obviously its a good proxy for the consumer marketplace at least right so i mean i think its pretty relevant to have this platform and so i appreciate you expanded color there and then just lastly and i apologize if i missed this earlier but i was wondering if you could just i know you talked about credit a little bit but just expand a little on the provision expense specifically right i mean it seems like record pipeline loan growth going to accelerate as the year progresses here but hopefully the credit conditions continue to improve i mean any thoughts on that dynamic and how that could balance out in your provision line going forward michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah as you pointed out the question was asked and i hope it was answered earlier but ill try to do it again just real quickly michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah im sorry about that i was kind of jumping back and forth here so michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp no trouble the biggest movement is the choice of the moodys models for us so baseline s3 and s4 mostly driven by our decision in the first quarter around uncertainty around the pace of the vaccine rollouts combined with is the real fundamental economic rebound or is it more about government money and so because of that we stuck to a little more i would say tilted towards a little more recessionary forecast and so my comments earlier were all else being equal and keeping pace with loan growth so obviously the way cecl works is when you add new loans youre going to have to keep pace with whatever category theyre in but assuming that thats not the largest driver i would expect the bias would be for us to take less in provision moving forward all other things being equal michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it so i mean i know obviously its way more complicated than this but kind of growing into the acl as conditions improve but youre loan balances hopefully expand michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 29apr2021 yeah thats a tricky thing because ive seen that in a couple of peoples write ups thats not actually how cecl works you dont really michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah i know michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah you get it michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc probably an oversimplification but i guess maybe said in another way youre not targeting at this point with the way youre balancing the moodys forecast any dramatic economicrelated reserve release at this particular point in time michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp yeah i think as i said earlier its going to be driven by the moodys scenarios that we pick and as moodys changes the numbers for both gdp and u3 unemployment in their models as well michael perito q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah okay thank you guys i really appreciate all the color on the call today thanks ira d robbins a president chief executive officer chairman valley national bancorp thank you operator im showing no further questions at this time i
