chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jennifer good morning and welcome to our third quarter earnings call before i begin our call i want to take a moment to acknowledge the profound impact of hurricanes helene and milton on our community the devastation has been immense affecting countless lives and businesses however in the face of such adversity we have witnessed incredible resilience and solidarity our communities are coming together determined to recover and rebuild stronger than ever at synovus we are committed to supporting these efforts and playing an active role in the recovery process together we will overcome these challenges and build a brighter future now lets review third quarter results synovus reported gaap earnings per share of which included an million visa valuation adjustment we reported adjusted diluted eps of which increased sequentially primarily driven by stronger net interest income coupled with lower provision for credit losses and stable adjusted noninterest expense the most notable financial headlines for the quarter included a sequentially higher net interest margin yearoveryear adjusted revenue growth of over driven by a jump in adjusted noninterest revenue coupled with an adjusted noninterest expense decline of synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 finally our net chargeoffs improved again in the third quarter down to basis points and our liquidity and capital positions remain quite strong synovus continues to demonstrate progress in various key initiatives we are steadily attracting talent in various client facing and corporate services roles noninterest revenue growth remains strong and lending pipelines and production are returning to more elevated levels lastly i am extremely pleased with the continued progress we are delivering and strengthening our balance sheet which positions us well as we close out and pivot towards a more constructive growth environment in now lets turn to slide and for some more specifics on the financial highlights for the quarter net interest income increased from the second quarter as the net interest margin expanded basis points to funded loan production rose sequentially and period end loans were up million we continue to generate healthy and consistent loan growth in the middle market cib and specialty commercial units while line utilization was stable however loan pay down and payoff activity and strategic rationalization and nonrelationship credit provided a headwind to third quarter outstandings growth core deposit growth of was attributable to increases in money market and operating deposits noninterest bearing deposits were more stable in the third quarter with a decline of million sequentially furthermore we reduced brokered deposits for the fifth consecutive quarter our team remains very focused on accelerating core funding generation through sales activities and product expansion while continuing to manage through an overall diminishment cycle adjusted noninterest revenue declined from the prior quarter primarily from lower capital markets income on a yearoveryear basis adjusted noninterest revenue increased significantly up as there was sharp growth in commercial sponsorship income from expansion of the card sponsorship business and our partnership with greensky capital markets and treasury and payment solutions fees also contributed to a strong yearoveryear growth adjusted noninterest expense was relatively flat quarteroverquarter and down on a yearoveryear basis our cost initiatives as well as ongoing diligence have contained overall expense growth yearoveryear we have also maintained a level of strategic investment that positions synovus well from a competitive standpoint in order to drive longterm shareholder value on the asset quality front as expected net chargeoffs were basis points compared to basis points in the second quarter while the allowance for credit losses were relatively stable at lastly we further bolstered our common equity tier ratio in the third quarter through solid earnings accretion while still completing about million of opportunistic share repurchases common equity tier levels are at their highest in nine years at and currently sit just above our stated range of to our successes are anchored by our team members and their dedication and passion for delivering the synovus purpose on a daily basis financially this was a strong quarter of execution where we posted an adjusted return on average assets of and an adjusted return on tangible common equity of while managing down our adjusted tangible efficiency ratio to moreover we continue to deliver in areas that have presented broader risk concerns surrounding the industry by lowering credit costs limiting fraud losses reducing wholesale funding and delivering deposit betas during the easing cycle all while maintaining elevated levels of capital we are demonstrating great progress and momentum that will continue into the fourth quarter and beyond synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 and now ill turn it over to jamie to cover the third quarter results in greater detail jamie andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin moving to slide period end loans grew million from the prior quarter loan production which was up sequentially and yearoveryear has started to show signs of a rebound within both our cre and ci segments line utilization was essentially stable however increased commercial loan production was offset by commercial real estate payoffs consumer softness and continued nonrelationship portfolio rationalization strong yeartodate growth in strategic lending verticals such as middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lines has been essentially offset by paydowns and payoffs and nonrelationship loan portfolio rationalization we generated million in sequential growth and million or yeartodate growth in middle market commercial cib and specialty lines this was offset by a million yeartodate decline in institutional cre and senior housing loans from marketrelated activity we continue to strategically reduce our nonrelationship lending within our national accounts portfolio as well as thirdparty consumer loans further positioning our balance sheet for core client growth these balances were down million in the third quarter and million year to date overall we estimate loans will remain stable in the fourth quarter driven by continued growth in our key commercial segments offset by cre and senior housing payoff and paydown activity as we look into we expect the market related and strategic declines to abate positioning us well to return to a growth posture that is core to our value proposition turning to slide periodend core deposit balances rose million or on a linked quarter basis noninterestbearing deposit balances fell million from the prior quarter with balances generally exhibiting more stability throughout the quarter relative to the headwinds experienced over the last year there was growth in money market and operating accounts partially offset by a decline in noninterestbearing savings and time deposits meanwhile brokered deposits declined million or from the second quarter which was the fifth consecutive quarter of contraction deposit costs rose basis points from the prior quarter to primarily as a result of mix shift and the residual impact of higher average noninterestbearing deposit balances in the second quarter as we ended the quarter we saw deposit rates begin to decline led by reductions in rates on higher beta deposits as well as time deposits as we look to the fourth quarter we expect deposit costs to generally follow the to beta that we have communicated previously it is worth highlighting that approximately twothirds of our core time deposit portfolio matures within the next five months in terms of deposit balance expectations for the fourth quarter we expect broadbased deposit growth across our business segments supported by seasonal public funds tailwind moving to slide net interest income was million in the third quarter an increase of quarterover quarter while the net interest margin was basis points higher at the third quarter now benefited from various drivers which included a full quarter impact of the securities repositioning in may and a modest synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 improvement in asset yields which more than offset the impact of the aforementioned negative deposit mix shifts and other lesser factors net interest income benefited from the slightly wider net interest margin with lower average loan balances during the quarter serving as a modest headwind as we look forward to the fourth quarter we expect that in isolation continued fomc easing will serve as a modest headwind to the net interest margin largely as a result of the repricing lead lag impacts we have outlined previously however opposite that we expect fixed rate asset repricing including million in loan hedges maturing in the fourth quarter to help support a relatively stable fourth quarter net interest margin kevin will provide further detail on our updated guidance momentarily slide shows total reported noninterest revenue of million adjusted noninterest revenue declined from the previous quarter and increased yearoveryear when looking at the yearago quarter core banking fees increased supported by growth in treasury and payment solutions while capital markets fees increased and commercial sponsorship income rose sharply the sequential decline was primarily attributable to a decline in capital markets fees which were elevated in the second quarter wealth management income rose from the prior quarter while core banking fees were relatively flat we continue to demonstrate strong noninterest revenue momentum relative to peers by investing in solutions that deepen client relationships and provide healthy growth in areas such as treasury and payment solutions capital markets and wealth management moving to expense slide highlights our ongoing operating cost discipline reported noninterest expense was million in the third quarter which included an million visa valuation adjustment adjusted noninterest expense was relatively stable sequentially and lower from the year ago period employment expense increased from the second quarter which was offset by a drop in other expense primarily attributable to lower legal and other creditrelated cost employment expense had a modest increase of yearoveryear the increased costs associated with merit and benefit programs were mitigated by our efficiency efforts leading to a yearoveryear decline in head count occupancy and equipment expense increased as a result of ongoing technology and infrastructure investments these items were more than offset by a drop in other expense as a result of lower fdic expense and operational losses relative to the same period last year importantly we will remain proactive with disciplined expense management in this growthconstrained environment moving to slide on credit quality provision for credit losses declined from the second quarter to million our allowance for credit losses ended the third quarter at million or which is relatively unchanged from the prior period driven by improved overall performance offset by individually analyzed loans our preliminary analysis of the impact of hurricane helene indicates that a specific provision for credit losses is not necessary at this time we will continue to analyze the potential loss impact of both hurricanes helene and milton net chargeoffs in the third quarter were million or basis points annualized compared to basis points annualized in the second quarter nonperforming loans increased million and are now of loans up from in the second quarter primarily from a single office loan relationship the criticized and classified ratio rose slightly to and remains at a very manageable level we maintain a high degree of confidence in the strength and quality of our loan portfolio and we will continue to reduce our non synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 relationship credits and manage the portfolio with a heightened level of diligence in this more uncertain macroeconomic environment as seen on slide our capital position was stable in the third quarter with the preliminary common equity tier ratio reaching and total riskbased capital now at another strong quarter for core operating performance serves as a continued tailwind to our capital position which alongside a relatively stable balance sheet supported us purchasing approximately million in common shares within the quarter while maintaining relatively stable capital ratios as a reminder our focus remains on prioritizing the deployment of our balance sheet and capital position for core client growth however amid the current environment we have used share repurchases as a complement to effectively manage within our capital management framework as we look to the remainder of the year we will maintain this disciplined approach which acknowledges uncertainty in the current environment and ensures sufficient capital for expected client growth our remaining share repurchase authorization in is approximately million which we expect will be fully utilized by year end ill now turn it back to kevin to discuss our fourth quarter guidance kevin s blair chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you jamie ill now continue with our updated guidance for the fourth quarter of based on yearto date results our current pipelines and expected payoff activity periodend loans are forecasted to be relatively flat in the fourth quarter and be down to flat for the full year of growth in the fourth quarter will continue to be driven by middle market corporate and investment banking and specialty lending lines our expectations for core deposit growth remain within the to range in the fourth quarter and up to for the full year aided by seasonal public funds tailwinds and new core funding growth initiatives our outlook now points to adjusted revenue of million to million in the fourth quarter and a range of negative to negative for the full year importantly our adjusted revenue guidance now assumes a larger amount of rate cuts than our previous guidance with basis points of cumulative rate cuts occurring in the fourth quarter net interest margin should be relatively stable in the fourth quarter as a result of lower deposit costs combined with fixed rate asset repricing and our hedge maturities adjusted noninterest revenue growth is forecasted in the midsingledigit percentage range for the year our capital markets fee pipeline is building and we continue to execute on core growth in treasury and payment solutions we remain very focused on disciplined expense control we anticipate our adjusted noninterest expense will be between million and million in the fourth quarter excluding the fdic special assessment up approximately for the full year given current credit migration trends and assuming a relatively stable economic environment we expect net chargeoffs to remain fairly stable within a basis point to basis point annualized range in the fourth quarter compared to basis points yeartodate moving to the tax rate our current forecast points to an approximately to level in the fourth quarter we will continue to use share repurchases to manage overall capital near current levels there is approximately synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 million of share repurchase authorization remaining which we expect to fully utilize in the fourth quarter we will continue to support a strong and liquid balance sheet which is prioritized toward serving the growth needs of our clients regardless of the economic environment and now operator this concludes our prepared remarks lets open the call for questions question and answer section operator thank you well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question for today comes from brandon king of truist your line is now open please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning brandon brandon king q analyst truist securities inc jamie could you expand on your margin expectations beyond the fourth quarter particularly if we get a more protracted easing cycle it seems like with the lag nature of deposits with that being less of a headwind we could see some margin expansion as we get into next year so i just wanted to get your overall thoughts on that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thanks brandon as we look at the margin in the near term as we said in our guide we expect the margin to be relatively stable in the fourth quarter and that would continue early into as we expect the easing cycle to continue as we go through the first half of next year but when the easing cycle stops we do expect to see margin expansion due to the significant amount of fixed rate asset and hedge exposures on the balance sheet that will be unlocked over time and so for us we think that relatively stable margin in the medium term and then once you get past the easing cycle we expect to see the margin start to expand as we unlock the value in those fixed rate exposures brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay got it so in other words in order to see any expansion you need the fed to remain on hold is that a fair assumption synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well it depends on how long the easing cycle is as weve said before we believe that we are relatively neutral to the front end of the curve and so outside of that lead and lag impact we do believe that were neutral to the front of the curve and so at some point the fixed rate asset repricing tailwind will come in regardless of easing or no easing and so that will happen but youre right to think in the medium term relatively stable on the margin but the fixed rate asset repricing will start to flow in as we go through in any scenario brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay okay got it and then lastly for me on credit encouraging to see net chargeoffs trend lower i just wanted to get an overall sense of the confidence in that net chargeoffs can remain sort of in this range for the foreseeable future and if there are any concerns as far as tail risk out there within your portfolio robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey brandon this is bob ill take that one yeah we are pretty confident in that guidance range i mean certainly this quarter was at the lower end of our range and were happy with that but were holding on that guidance at basis point to basis point really based on what weve done in terms of individual loan analysis et cetera we had an npl increase this quarter that jamie spoke of that is baked in there as well so yeah all in all i think the guidance is good certainly in the short term and then as we get into well think more about our guidance certainly as we get into the conferences in january brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you brandon robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp thank you brandon operator thank you our next question comes from jared shaw of barclays your line is now open please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hey good morning everybody thanks for the question i guess maybe the first one just looking at loan growth and production as we go into is this level of production sort of a good baseline to use synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 and can you refresh our memory on sort of what is the balance of those noncore loans that are still out there in terms of sort of nonrelationship cre the shared national credits the thirdparty consumer that youre talking about whats the aggregate headwind that that could be producing kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah its a great question and for many reasons i feel like were following up on a year where we talked so much jared about balance sheet optimization im way more optimistic about our prospects to renew our growth orientation as we enter and its for a couple of reasons to your first point production has been consistently growing when you look back at kind of our troughed first quarter production that was the low watermark for us as it relates to funded production weve seen the loan production increase in the second quarter and now again in the third quarter up another and that would put the third quarter higher than where we were in first quarter our pipelines are fairly stable and so we would expect to see production levels to continue to increase for a couple of reasons number one we think that theres a tremendous amount of uncertainty associated with the election so once we get the election behind us we think that could drive some demand and two as rates continue to come lower we think that could also stimulate the production side of the equation to your point on the strategic runoff or strategic optimization weve taken the last year to exit and reduce our exposure in various asset classes that quite frankly we just didnt think had the type of return profile that we wanted that included our medical office sale which was around billion weve run down our syndicated lending portfolio as well as our thirdparty consumer lending portfolio thats about billion of yearoveryear runoff or about of our outstandings thats largely complete at this point well continue to see some runoff in the thirdparty consumer but this last quarter that was around million so not a substantial amount so that headwind has largely been played and going forward we shouldnt have the same impact number three line utilization yeah this quarter were roughly at and thats stabilized we had seen a decline over the last several quarters if you go back to the same period last year we were at roughly so just getting back to a normal utilization rate would provide about billion of incremental growth and then lastly we continue to add new talent in middle market were up almost ftes this year specialty lending and were now starting to expand our sales resources in our community bank across many of our higher opportunity markets so for all of those reasons i have greater confidence that will look more like a normal year for loan growth jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats great color really appreciate the details on that and just as a followup for me whats the maybe for jamie whats the impact of those hedge maturities on the hedge costs you called out the million hedges maturing in fourth quarter whats the cost on that and is there anything as we look at sort of the first half of we should be focused on robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 yeah those hedges a couple of things on that the average rate is basis points in the fourth quarter there are million that matured already on october and then million that matures on december when you look heading into what youll see is stability in the balances of the hedge portfolio but a little bit of remixing as theres a couple of maturities that come through and then you have some forwardstarting hedges that start so youll see the effective rate on the hedges increase as we go through early getting up to about the area in the second quarter and thats the general trend so the headwind from the hedge portfolio diminishes really as we go through and when you get out into the second half of those rates are not too dissimilar from market rates and so the headwind there is expected to really abate as we go through jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc great thanks very much operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america your line is now open please go ahead oh sorry ebrahim your line is now open kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp alex lets go to the next caller operator of course our next question for today comes from christopher marinac of janney montgomery scott your line is now open please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning chris jennifer demba a directorinvestor relations synovus financial corp hey chris we cant hear you operator sorry chris are you able to just come closer to the microphone for us apologies were still not receiving any audio well move on for now our next question comes from timur braziler from wells fargo your line is now open please go ahead timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning timur timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc my first question is around the capital market income in the quarter it sounded a little bit more pessimistic on the latest update and then the numbers still came in pretty good i guess in an expectation for the rest of the year is there anything chunky thats still coming through or did some of that chunkiness materialize in wed just love to get an expectation of what we should see there for the remainder of the year andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah timur its a great point and we are really pleased with the performance of our capital markets business and youre right you look at it and its quarteronquarter its down but thats from a high watermark in the second quarter and we are really pleased with kind of where we stand right now we believe that million a quarter is a good number to use to build off of and i would just say dont forget that this is an environment of low transaction volume and so for the team to be out there delivering solutions to our clients thats driving this million revenue thats a real positive and as we look at the fourth quarter were expecting relative stability in capital markets revenue you clearly will see mixes between the line items embedded in that business but we expect stability but the teams are working on projects that are lumpy and they are positives but were not including that in any of our guidance today kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp i think timur id add just when you look at this last quarter at the million about came from derivatives about from syndications and lead arranger fees from debt capital markets from fx and about from governmentguaranteed loan sales so it shows you the granularity amongst the categories and to jamies point that kind of serves as the baseline for growth going forward timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then maybe a bigger picture question again the update provided i guess its close to a month ago now relative to the results the results were pretty meaningfully stronger i guess what was the biggest surprise in the back end of the year that drove the result relative to the last guide andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we look at what happened here as we wound down the quarter there were positives across the board really in ppnr and in credit and so if we look at nii we had outperformance of loan yields versus expectation nondeposit liability cost outperformed really just strength across the board in nii and that led to that margin expansion you saw for the full quarter within fee revenue it was our wealth business that drove the outperformance in the last month of the quarter and then on expenses a couple of things happened there we had a million decline in our fdic expense and that impacted our expectations and then we had various other synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 kind of timingrelated good guys on nie that just came through in september that were each positive and so a lot of good news in the month of september giving us a nice tailwind heading into the end of the year timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and if i could just squeeze one more on credit again encouraged by the loss content but just looking at trends in nonperforming loans and the classified criticize how close are we in tapping out especially in the classified criticized categories is that kind of the top here i guess any kind of color as to what your internal expectations are for where classified and criticized loans can top out robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah timur its bob again i would say were close i mean certainly if you looked at the criticized trend the rated trend we were down last quarter i think from to ticked back up a little bit this quarter to so were kind of bouncing a little bit here i think the bias is still slightly negative but weve had some upgrades and certainly were still having some downgrades but overall i think the velocity of that increase is certainly not as strong as it was our grading process does have a little bit of a lag because were grading on a quarterly basis looking back for the most part so even though rates are beginning to help us youre still going to have a little bit of lag effect so you could see a slight increase but i think youre close in your comments around i think thats a fair number for us we have a very strong risk grading team very well led we have a great loan review process internally so i feel really good about the accuracy we get a downgrade occasionally of course but overall i think we get really good marks on the accuracy and your point around beginning to peak is probably pretty good and were pretty close timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks for the color kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp thank you operator thank you our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala of bank of america your line is now open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i just want to follow up in terms of deposit pricing and just how youre thinking about deposit growth going forward so one if you could comment on whats the pricing environment how do you expect deposit betas to behave assuming the fed is able to cut a few times before the end of the year and then just talk to us about new deposit acquisition where are they coming from and how do you see the mix shift in nib ib evolving from here thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp so ebrahim let me just lets dive into the slide or the table we included on the deposit slide in our earnings deck we added a third quarter update to the far right and our intent there was to show what has actually happened since the easing in the middle of september and i think its highly indicative of what we will see going forward and what you see is the team is out there actively working with our clients and focused on reducing the cost of deposits and you see going on rate and time deposits basis points lower than june implying an beta that will come through over time however if you looked at the end of september time deposit costs weve only realized about basis points of decline so while new production would imply an beta the actual kind of what weve realized to date is around a beta on brokered repricing in the low beta we have a beta and on the higher beta stuff we have a so if you just kind of use that and use the percent of deposits what you see is with what we realized to date on time the lower number the beta you get to about a cumulative total deposit beta realized through september now what weve said is we expected to be to and so as time deposits flow through and you realize that beta that bring that number up to about and we dont believe that thats the end of the story we believe that theres further repricing to go from there we believe that brokered could easily end up being about beta we believe that the low beta and the high beta have room for improvement and so thats what were looking at on the deposit side for deposit betas and the easing cycle clearly its uncertain how this will go our current expectation is to see basis point cuts at sequential meetings but it depends on how we go through that as to how it will all play out with regards to deposit growth we believe as we said that deposits will grow here in the fourth quarter a lot of that has to do with seasonals we expect to see growth throughout our wholesale bank predominantly as you land within the lower cost deposits and so for the fourth quarter we would expect to see as far as percent of total deposits reduction with high cost time deposits with brokered deposits and then increase in the percentage weightings of now accounts in money markets and so thats what we were expecting to see here in the near term and then as we look into i would just say that we are expecting to see continuation of core deposit growth it is a clear priority for us weve grown core deposits faster than loans for five consecutive quarters we expect to synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 see that continue as we go through and thatll be a function of general environmental where we believe tailwinds we believe youll see less headwinds from monetary policy we believe well see client growth and this diminishment headwind that weve seen for multiple years since we believe that that will slow and stop and so we think that the headwinds that have been slowing core deposit growth will abate and well see what weve seen in the past which is strong core client acquisition client growth leading to core deposit growth heading in through ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats very comprehensive thank you so much and just wanted to follow up on our embedded payments business maast we spent a lot of time on the investor day a couple of years ago on this just remind us where things stand it does feel like when you look at top down from the likes of jpmorgan partnering with oracle there is a lot of push towards embedded banking i think that is something differentiated that synovus had started im just wondering how thats gone are you as bullish less bullish relative to when you first launched this initiative kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp well ebrahim i think to your point i think the marketplace is speaking where there are competitors that are rolling out similar products and as i said last quarter one of the things that weve recognized is that in order to have a embedded finance solution that stands out in the marketplace youve got to have solutions and products and capabilities that differentiate yourself and so we built the beta version that had a mvp product as you recall we had various clients on that platform and what were doing today is were looking at the offering that we provide and trying to improve some of the value propositions as it relates to the payment facilitation as well as some of the depository instruments that sit on the platform so like anything else we went out we piloted we saw we received the feedback and now were working on creating a solution that has a stronger value proposition and well roll that out in the future with some additional bells and whistles but right now weve taken that same set of resources and we focus as much on our commercial sponsorship business where were looking to increase the amount of revenue that we earn today off of sponsoring merchant acquiring companies access to the mastercard and visa rails thats about a million million revenue business for us today and that same group thats working on maast is working on enhancing the population of clients that we use there and then once we have that we can also offer the maast solution to those isos not just to the software vendors so know that were working on the product and well come out in a future quarter and talk about what the enhancements are ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and you dont think scale is a disadvantage relative to the larger regionals or the big money center banks relative to what youre trying to do kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp no i think scale matters less there its about the partnerships and relationships that youre able to create with those independent software vendors or isos and what weve said in the past one of the reasons we felt that we synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 had a right to win in that space is weve been in this payments business for a long time dating back to our tsys ownership and so to me its much more if you have the right product its about applying the right partnership and being able to add value to that client i mean thats what embedded finance really is is youre creating a new revenue stream for that iso or that independent software vendor so i dont think scale matters as much as having partnerships but you got to have a product thats going to generate revenue for that client ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good thank you operator thank you our next question comes from chris marinac from janney montgomery scott your line is now open please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc thanks good morning bob i had a credit question for you thank you for the detail on the multifamily book in the slides can you give us an update on sort of how the criticized ratios look for that or how you would anticipate those play out the next few quarters robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah hey chris thanks for the question yeah multifamily if you look at it overall we have i dont think theres certainly zero nonaccruals in multifamily and very little if any substandard loans so most of that is what we would classify as a special mention migration in multifamily due primarily to some oversupply issues that we see in various markets and with construction projects coming online in the face of some oversupply however from a loss content perspective we feel really good about our multifamily book its certainly been a business that weve been bullish on for years were very good at it we like where we are our sponsors in that space really good so overall yeah a little bit of negative migration there but from a loss content perspective we just dont see it and once we kind of get through a little bit of time and some of the oversupply issues begin to abate in various markets i think were still long term feel really good about multifamily particularly in light of the housing environment as youre aware christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great and then just a general question on overall the credit migration we saw in nonperforming so theres typically already criticized in prior quarters and so thats just kind of moving through the pipeline robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp short answer is yes and in this particular case we had an office credit office relationship that we moved to non accrual if you back that out i know its easy for me to do that but if you back that out our nonaccruals actually would have decreased slightly synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 so its a one credit story there that weve been working through for some period of time and we obviously have gone through our process as well feel good about where we are there and just continuing to work through that credit just couldnt hold it from an accrual perspective but yes it was rated before christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc got it and generally speaking the lower rate environment that we now have is going to make it easier more flexible for you to work through credits as time passes robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp well it certainly doesnt hurt so thats a good point as we mentioned earlier chris theres a little bit of a lag effect on the ratings where youre typically looking at the previous quarter and so itll take some time and the other point i would make on grading is that its a little bit slower upgrading than it is downgrading so i think as you get into a little bit further youll start to see some benefit there but generally speaking the lower rates would certainly help kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and chris weve talked about this in prior quarters and some of the conferences were going to have some volatility as bob mentioned on the criticized and classified even npl but the thing that gives us confidence is when we look at those loans that are in nonaccruing status theyre largely to loans that represent of the balance so to bobs earlier point were doing individual loan analysis to understand what the loss content would be and i hope that you get the same confidence that we get when we give out the basis point to basis point guidance which is largely lower than what weve experienced year to date that even with some of these migrations were not expecting any material increase in loss content and at the end of the day that youll see some movement there but i think thats the bottom line of the story christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc yeah great point kevin thank you both i appreciate the information this morning robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yeah thanks chris operator thank you our next question comes from ph tony elliott from jpmorgan your line is now open please go ahead q synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 hi good morning on slide you note the good growth in ci balances you saw during the quarter but line utilization was relatively stable i guess what will it take to see that utilization rate increase is it more rate cuts getting past the election i appreciate your thoughts there kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah i think its all of the above we do a survey with our commercial clients that says what concerns you the number one concern was the election and obviously whether you republican or democrat wins in many ways it just takes some uncertainty off the table so i think getting that behind us in november will be helpful number two the concern that our clients have are around the strength of the consumer and i think that really gets to the underlying strength of the economy can the consumer continue to spend and the consumer has been fairly resilient through this entire cycle and if that continues i think that will take another concern off the table the third is just declining margins of our clients and i think that has to do with inflation and thats the residual impact of just having inflation come down to match what they can pass on to the client and the fourth is labor availability so its amazing to me that at the end of the day one of the things holding back capital requests are finding the people to be able to work that new business line or support their growth so i think its going to take the election getting behind us line utilization as i said earlier could be as much as billion of growth just back to a normalized level but were already seeing production levels increase and the one thing we havent talked about is just payoff and paydown activities weve said this year was not a normal year when you look at our commercial portfolio each quarter we had about billion of payoffs and paydowns this year were averaging closer to billion and thats going to remain elevated for several more quarters especially as cre has some more payoff activities but that also will return to more normalized levels so when you add in the fact that uncertainty goes away production increases we add in new talent and the payoff activity slows i think youll start to see loan growth return to more normalized levels q thank you and then my follow up noninterestbearing balances were relatively stable on a periodend basis but declined at a faster on average given the number of rate cuts projected by the forward curve into next year do you see those balances growing at some point in thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp ph tony we would expect to see some growth in those balances in i mean its highly uncertain thatd be a change in trend so but were optimistic that we can through client acquisition and core business that we can get a tailwind there but thats to be determined synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 q thank you operator thank you our next question comes from samuel varga of ubs your line is now open please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc hey good morning jamie i wanted to ask about the particular part of loan growth middle market cib and specialty lending can you give us a sense for where those yields are relative to the book just in terms of the commercial yields like are these is this mix of growth naturally benefiting your commercial loan yields andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp when you look at those businesses and the spreads in those businesses cib would be on the tighter end and would actually be kind of tighter than our overall production but we are seeing some tailwinds due to the spreads in those other businesses on middle market and specialty they change they ebb and flow especially in specialty but in general its the cib think about larger lower spread originations strong credits and then the others you can generally get a little more spread kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp and id add jamie in this last quarter when you look at our total yields on production were about million million and the portfolio is about million so everything were putting on today although that basis points lower than what it was in the second quarter given the rate cut were still seeing a going on yield that will be accretive to the overall portfolio its about basis points higher samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you both thats very helpful and then just on the next slide on deposits and sort of the core cd beta that youve alluded to the that youve realized on the new production im just curious if you can give any color at this time on whether that beta is still supporting the volumes you need or is there any point where the beta gets almost like capped because you need to bring the volume in for the deposit base to support the loan growth on the other side andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp well if you look at the production levels time production was actually higher quarter on quarter with much lower rates of production and so we believe that what were doing is appropriate we believe that it will be sufficient for what were looking for on the funding side synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 but i would just say that were not beholden to any product for individual liquidity purposes if we think its a better idea to reduce our time deposit rates and use a brokered or home loan bank or anything like that to offset that funding thats easy to do because we have increased capacity of wholesale funding which we continue to draw down and so our funding story is really strong because were in a spot where we can choose between all the different sources of liquidity and right now we think that its prudent to be fairly aggressive in the reduction of cd rates especially the promo rates as we go through this easing cycle samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc understood thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from stephen scouten of piper sandler your line is now open please go ahead stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co hi good morning everyone im curious kind of around potential operating leveraging in do you think that is a plausible target or do you really need to see maybe the ability for fixed rate loan repricing to create that inflection point in the nim to drive that or what might be the catalyst if you think it is plausible andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp as we look to and we will give more guidance on this later in the quarter at an industry conference but as we look to we believe a couple of things we believe that expense growth will be higher than it is right now obviously were not growing expenses weve done a lot to drive that performance but we do believe that expense growth will be higher in than what weve seen recently really as we lean into the opportunities here in the southeast we believe that the growth opportunities in the southeast are strong and we believe that we have the right to win and so we will lean into that here at the end of this year and as we head into and so expense growth will be higher but we believe that our goal alongside higher revenue growth and so we expect to see on the revenue side as kevin walked through in detail why we expect to see loan growth all those different components if you combine just pure business growth along with line utilization increases along with increased transaction activity we do expect to see strong revenue growth that goes with that and so operating leverage in is possible obviously the rate environment is very important the economic environment is very important a lot of uncertainties as we look that far forward at the moment but we do see paths to that as we look into stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co okay extremely helpful and i know you also said the path of noninterestbearing deposits remains uncertain as well but are you seeing any kind of glimpses of things that could create a shift in terms of the pace of decline because it looked like that on an endofperiod basis that pace of decline actually didnt ramp up even a bit this synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 quarter so im just wondering if theres anything youre seeing that would give you some hope of nearterm stability there on those noninterestbearing deposits kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp i think jamie and his team have been looking at the various segments of where were seeing dda diminishment i think on the positive side weve seen the consumer average balance per account fall below which is kind of a low watermark and depending on what happens with consumer the level of diminishment could greatly decline we saw a little more this past quarter in business banking versus commercial commercial diminishment largely has dried up in the third quarter so i think the way to think about dda to jamies earlier point were going to produce some new level of production some of that now is finding its way into interestbearing checking so youre not going to get the noninterest bearing but the biggest driver to your question is the diminishment of average balance per account and each quarter we are seeing that continue to decline when it actually hits its trough we cant predict that but it appears based on that trajectory that were getting closer to that stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect thanks for the color appreciate it operator thank you our next question comes from michael rose of raymond james your line is now open please go ahead michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys thanks for taking my questions most have been asked and answered but just wanted to get any sort of updates on the thought process around ma last month we saw the occ fdic and doj kind of update their merger review process and as i step back and i think about the way the industry could consolidate over the intermediate to longer term as i think about the southeast and where you guys are from an asset size perspective you have a couple banks that have come into your markets or at least come into the southeast a little bit more aggressively you have some of the megabanks building branches seemingly on every corner in every one of your markets is there more a risk of not doing something versus doing something over the intermediate to longer term do you think as it relates to kind of longer term financial targets or not just wanted to see if as we think about consolidation and whats going to happen with the industry over the intermediate to longer term what role does that mean for synovus thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp yeah michael its a great question were hearing more and more discussions around what happens if the administration changes and does that drive more ma activity and you can hear from some of the other earnings calls that others have recognized that southeast is a pretty great place to do business synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 but in many ways our answer is unchanged we believe that the greatest investment we can make today is in synovus and adding talent continuing to add new technology new capabilities and solutions to continue to drive deeper wallet share with our existing clients and attract new clients in many ways in the short and medium term that sense of acquisition or the impact that would be associated with any sort of migration or conversion would actually create greater opportunities for us to take share so i dont think anythings changed for us its no secret that the southeast is a great place to do business and to your point people are adding branches and putting lpos and adding teams and were continuing to focus on how we win market share and were doing that without having to buy a bank were adding new teams and new talent adding new technology so the story really hasnt changed and it just really means that to win in this space youve got to have a real value proposition and thats why when we look at some of these awards that we win whether its jd power greenwich its important for us to continue to provide a level of service and advice that is second to none that beats our competition and thats i think the most important part rather than trying to do an acquisition that relies on cost reductions and revenue synergies to generate that eps growth were focused on synovus and what we can do to take advantage of the organic opportunities michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay and maybe just one followup just as it relates to the organic opportunity i know you talked about and i know its early for next year but you talked about more of a normal year of loan growth but you do have some self maybe imposed headwinds that are abating in terms of thirdparty healthcare things like that line utilization as i think you mentioned could begin to pick up once you get through the election and some of these other things what does a normal year kind of mean for synovus historically its been kind of a few percentage points above gdp growth that correlation is kind of broken down here in recent years for i think obvious reasons but kind of what does that mean for synovus maybe not just for next year but as we think about the next couple of years thanks kevin s blair a chairman president chief executive officer synovus financial corp so michael you said it what weve said in the past its hard to give someone an absolute range to your point based on what the underlying growth would be given by the economy so weve always said basis points to basis points above the underlying growth and thats just predicated on the fact that we want to provide our fair share of growth plus something in excess to show that were taking market share from competition and so if we were to return to a normal to gdp growth you would expect us to be at somewhere around to loan growth and thats under a kind of normal situation and to your point for a lot of the reasons that you noted and i talked about earlier the headwinds are largely abating and its going to turn towards production and line utilization and one of the things that weve been doing over the last several years are continuing to add new arrows to our quiver as it relates to new businesses new specialty finance areas new teams were expanding synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 as i said earlier were starting to expand our community bank again where were adding talent in some of our high growth markets so for all of those reasons we still feel like we can outpace the market with loan growth exceeding that of the underlying gdp michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking my questions operator thank you our next question comes from gary tenner of da davidson your line is now open please go ahead gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning i had a follow up on the deposit side jamie i appreciate the commentary about two thirds of this of the core cd book maturing five months as you think about your posted rates and at least recent customer behavior is the expectation and strategy that youll be able to keep that slug of deposits pretty short and kind of be able to come back again second third quarter of next year to reprice them down again andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes thats our base case expectation and we will continually look at the forward curve and think about the spreads between longer term cds and for a shorter term but right now our focus is ensuring that that book reprices as quickly as possible but also solves what our clients are looking for they want some stability and they go into that because they want multiple months of flat rates on their deposits to be able to count on and so we have to be balanced in what we do but right now were leaning into that five month gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay appreciate that and then just a quick question on the office loan relationship i appreciate the fact that npls would have been down excluding that but any color there in terms of geography kind of the office product type just for some background color robert w derrick a chief credit officer executive vice president synovus financial corp yes sure not to get too specific on the credit but its two different cities two different suburban offices one is in the southeast one is not so thats kind of the outline of it about equal dollar amounts quite frankly but separate resolution plans working with those loans and again to your point i think if you do take out that office loan you look at the npl reduction overall but if you look specifically at our office portfolio the criticized or rated ratio is less than obviously this one is a non accrual so if you back that out you really dont have very much in the way of nonaccruals so there is some stability in the office book but we realize that over time i think youre going to continue to have oneoffs on office we think we got a good plan on this one actually to work through our resolution synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thank you operator thank you our next question comes from catherine mealor of kbw your line is now open please go ahead catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on the margin and just think about the yield to loan a little bit can we first start with the fixed rate book and is there any way to quantify just the amount of fixed rate repricing that we may see in andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp hi catherine catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and thats impacting the margin hey jamie andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah when we look at our outlook as far as the impact of fixed rate repricing has not materially changed outside of the fact when we used to say basis points but that was before the securities repositioning currently our expectation is about basis points of margin impact due to fixed rate repricing in and itd be the same number for so thats consistent really with what weve said before except for the fact that we accelerated that process with the securities repositioning earlier this year catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and then just as a follow up do you have where the fixed rate book where that current portfolio rate is today andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp the fixed rate book well we do the there are a couple of different components that ill point to so if youre working on the fixed rate repricing impact heres what i would how i would break it down our fixed rate commercial loan book is a little less than of assets its about assets those rates on the books are about below current origination rates so you have of the book below what i would consider todays market rates due to when they were originated on the mortgage portfolio thats about of assets and the book yield on that is around and so you could say thats or so or below market rates on the residential mortgage portfolio synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q3 earnings call 17oct2024 catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay okay great and then on the variable rate piece you had a really good slide in your last deck that just broke down the kinds of components of your variable rate loan portfolio can you talk a little bit about maybe the kind of the cadence of how quickly some of thats repricing what youve seen so far with a basis point cut and maybe what that means for loan yields as we go into the fourth quarter andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yes yeah absolutely i mean when you step back from a high level the loan beta starts with the of loans that are floating rate and then you back out the hedges and so on loans you should assume low beta through this easing cycle and thats pretty itll flow through pretty cleanly for total asset beta when you add in the securities portfolio you get to kind of low to mid on the asset beta of the balance sheet and so thats at a high level what youll see through the easing cycle on the asset side of the balance sheet when you look at the individual components of floating rate loans theyre progressing as you would expect with their contractual resets so we have about billion of loans that are one month sofr we have the billion that are a little less than billion that are oneyear treasury resets now those are really the only unique structures we have on the balance sheets those are oneyear treasury floating rate loans that reset monthly and so weve been seeing a little bit of margin pressure from those ever since one year started to go down a few months ago and so thats already been in there and itll continue depending on where oneyear treasuries go from here and then we have billion of prime loans we have overnight sofr loans around billion and those all will reset when the fed actually moves and i will just reiterate the point that on the hedge portfolio those are received fixed hedges pay overnight sofr and so those reset actually when the fed moves as well so thats a lot of detail around how our floating rate exposure will reset as we go through the cycle catherine mealor q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thats great very helpful all right thank you robert w derrick
