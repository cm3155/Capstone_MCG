record billion an increase of million or from december first quarter average loan growth was likewise average growth in residential mortgage and commercial real estate loans was partially offset by a modest decrease in average commercial and industrial loans total deposits were billion as of march a decrease of billion or from december first quarter average deposits were essentially unchanged from the fourth quarter in the first quarter time deposits grew due to successful branch based lunar new year cd campaign this was offset by declines in other deposit categories which reflected customers seeking higher use in a rising interest rate environment and banking industry disruption in midmarch deposit growth is well diversified by deposit type and of total deposits were in noninterest bearing demand accounts as of march our loan to deposit ratio was as of march turning to slide as shown in the exhibits on this slide all of our capital ratios expanded quarteroverquarter as of march we had a common equity tier ratio of up basis points quarteroverquarter a total capital ratio of up basis point quarteroverquarter and a tangible common equity ratio of up basis point quarteroverquarter those capital ratios are some of the highest among regional banks also on this slide are pro forma capital calculations as of march the key takeaway is that our capital is very strong in the slide we provided pro forma capital ratios adjusting for availableforsale and heldtomaturity security marks that are not already included in the capital ratios and also for on and off balance sheet allowance not already included in the capital ratios over the quarter our book value per share grew and our tangible book value per share increased whereas board of directors has declared second quarter dividend for the companys common stock the quarterly common dividend of will be payable on may to stockholders of record on may moving on to a discussion of our loan portfolio beginning with slide as of march ci loans outstanding were billion down only million or from prior quarter end and up yearoveryear as shown on this slide our ci portfolio continues to be well diversified by industry and sector greater china loans increased linked quarter to billion as of march east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 slide and show the details of our commercial real estate portfolio which is well diversified by geography and property type and consists of low loantovalue loans total commercial real estate loans were billion as of march up from december and up yearoveryear the quality of our loan portfolio remains very strong however given the attention on cre we have added more details about our office and retail commercial real estate loans on slide and slide you can see on slide our office commercial real estate portfolio is very granular with few large loans we have only seven loans totaling million that are greater than million in size the weighted average loanto value of our office commercial real estate portfolio is a low and the loantovalue is consistently low across loan size segments portfolio is welldiversified by geography with limited exposure to downtown and central business district areas slide you can see that our retail commercial real estate portfolio is also very granular with few large loans we have only seven loans totaling million which are greater than million in size the weighted average loan to value of our retail commercial real estate portfolio is a low and the loantovalue is also consistently low across loan size segments the portfolio is welldiversified by geographies and the footprint largely reflect our branch network in slide we provide details regarding our residential mortgage portfolio which consists of single family mortgages and home equity lines of credit our residential mortgage loans are primarily originated through our branch network i would highlight that of our key loan commitments were in a first lien position as of march residential mortgage loans totaled billion as of march up from december and up yearoveryear we added a new slide to provide more information about our granular diversified deposit base slide illustrates our deposit mix by segment and also industries for commercial deposits deposits totaled billion as of march a decrease of quarteroverquarter and less than yearoveryear now over deposit accounts at east west and our average commercial deposit account size is approximately and our retail branch base consumer deposit which totaled of our deposit have an average size of approximately commercial deposits are welldiversified by industry our largest commercial deposit industry segment at is real estate property investments and management these deposits are predominantly thousands of operating accounts for individual properties that are commercial real estate customers only as of march out of our billion in domestic deposit insured or otherwise collateralized deposits were billion and the domestic uninsured deposit ratio improved to down from as of december theres an industry disruption in midmarch our associates have worked with customers to expand the fdic insurance coverage primarily through the utilization of fully insured sweep programs and as of yesterday april the domestic uninsured deposit ratios improved to i will now turn the call over to irene for a more detailed discussion of our securities portfolio liquidity management asset quality and income statement irene irene h oh executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thank you dominic ill start with a discussion of our securities portfolio and liquidity management strategy on slide on march our securities availableforsale or afs had a fair value of billion with the weighted average spot yield of on a duration of approximately four years we purchased few afs securities in the first quarter gross unrealized losses on this portfolio were of amortized costs as of march already east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 reflected in tangible common equity as part of aoci march our securities heldtomaturity or htm had an amortized cost of billion and a weighted average spot yield of with a duration of approximately eight years we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until maturity gross unrealized losses on our htm securities were of amortized cost as of march at the time of the transfer of these securities from afs to htm in the first quarter of ph million of the unrealized losses were included in aoci and are reflected in equity as the remainder of the unrealized losses on htm were to be treated similarly to afs our tangible common equity would still be a very strong as of march we took many actions in response to the recent banking industry disruption first we increased our on balance sheet liquidity our cash and cash equivalents increased to billion as of march up from billion as of december this increase was primarily funded with billion borrowings with the bank term funding program at a cost of thus the on balance sheet liquidity has provided a positive carry and contribution to nii also we swiftly added to our borrowing capacity by pledging additional assets with the federal reserve and at fhlb san francisco our total borrowing capacity plus cash and cash equivalents were billion as of march equivalent to of our total uninsured and uncollateralized deposits we have a longstanding approach to conservative liquidity management at east west as an important component of our risk management practices moving on to asset quality metrics and components of our allowance for loan losses on slides and the asset quality of our loan portfolio continues to be strong nonperforming assets as of march decreased to million a basis points of total assets an improvement from million or basis points as of december quarteroverquarter criticized loans increased and the criticized loan ratio increased basis point our allowance for loan losses increased to million as of march or of loans up from as of year end during the first quarter we recorded net chargeoffs of or basis point of average loans annualized compared with net chargeoffs of basis points annualized in the fourth quarter reflecting the stability of our asset quality metrics our low chargeoffs and the current macroeconomic forecast we recorded a provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter compared with million for the fourth quarter last year again while asset quality remains strong and the current credit environment is benign we continue to remain vigilant we are actively monitoring the loan portfolio and taking proactive measures to build our allowance for loan losses we are performing ongoing deep dives into loan portfolio segments for example by commercial real estate property type and maturity year we are showing up loans when appropriate by security additional collateral guarantees or pay downs from our borrowers and now moving on to a discussion of our income statement on slide as dominic mentioned this quarter we had a nongaap adjustment to our eps of also early in the year we prepaid million of repo liabilities that carried a weighted average interest rate of amortization of tax credits and other investments in the first quarter was million compared with million in the fourth quarter variability in this line reflects timing when tax credit investments close for the second quarter of we are currently estimating that the amortization of tax credit investments will be approximately million the first quarter effective tax rate was compared with for the full year we currently anticipate that the effective tax rate for the full year of will also be east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 ill now review the key drivers of our net interest income and net interest margin on slides through starting with the average balance first quarter average loan growth was and first quarter average earning assets growth was reflecting the growth in loans and cash average deposits of billion were essentially unchanged quarteroverquarter reflecting growth of billion in cds offset by declines in other deposit accounts declines in other deposit categories reflected ongoing customer preferences for higher yields as well as the banking industry disruption in midmarch our average loan to deposit ratio was in the first quarter and average noninterestbearing demand deposits made up of average deposits turning to slide first quarter net interest income was million a decrease of from the fourth quarter due to day count net interest margin of compressed by basis points quarteroverquarter equalizing for day count the quarteroverquarter average earning asset growth more than offsets the basis points of nim contraction also as you can see from the waterfall chart on the slide nim compression in the first quarter reflected the impact of higher interest bearing funding costs and the funding mix shift partially offset by expanding asset yields in april we added million notional value received tax swap to augment the billion of swaps and collars we added in to help preserve net interest income when they decrease this impact was about basis points to nim this quarter nim would have been otherwise turning to slide the first quarter average loan yield was an increase of basis points quarterover quarter as of march the spot coupon rate on our loans was compared with as of yearend in the slide we also present the coupon spot yields for each major loan portfolio for the last five quarterends youll see the positive impact of rising interest rates on each loan portfolio indiscernible in total of our loan portfolio was variable rate as of march including linked to prime rate and linked to sofr or libor rates id also highlight that for our cre loan customers we have helped many of them hedge against rising rates through the use of swaps caps and collars fixed rate and synthetically fixed rate loans through the utilization of these derivatives are of the total cre book as of march while east west enjoys a benefit of asset sensitivity today the majority of our cre customers are protected against rising debt service costs in a higher rate environment turning to slide our average cost of deposits for the first quarter was basis points up basis points from the fourth quarter our spot rate on total deposits was basis points as of march equivalent to cumulative beta relative to the basis point increase in the target fed funds rate since december in comparison the cumulative beta on our loans has been over the same time period moving on to fee income on slide total noninterest income in the first quarter was million excluding the impairment of the aforementioned security adjusted noninterest income in the first quarter was million up from million in the prior quarter slide first quarter noninterest expense was million excluding amortization of tax credit and cdi and debt extinguishment costs on the repo adjusted noninterest expense was million in the first quarter up sequentially primarily driven by seasonal first quarter increases in comp and employee benefit expense the first quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was compared with in the fourth quarter our adjusted pretax pre provision income was million in the first quarter and our pretax preprovision return on assets was an industry leading east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 next outlook on slide for the full year of compared to full year of we currently expect yearover year loan growth in the range of to yearoveryear and net interest income growth in the range of to underpinning our net interest income assumptions is a forward interest rate curve as of march adjusted noninterest expense growth in the range of to we expect our revenue and expense outlook to result in positive operating leverage in terms of credit for the full year of we expect to record a provision for credit losses in the range of million to million the provision for credit losses for will largely be driven by change in the macroeconomic outlook and loan growth today asset quality is excellent and we believe that the potential losses from any problem loans are limited finally we expect that our effective tax rate for the full year will be approximately based on about million of tax credit investments for the year excluding low income housing tax credits and an estimated related tax credit amortization of approximately million for the full year there will be quarterly variability in the tax rate and the tax credit amortization due to the timing of tax credit investments placed into service with that i will now turn the call back over to dominic for closing remarks dominic ng chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene in closing east west has a sound business model and healthy balance sheet this reflected in our granular deposit base and our diversified loan portfolio with strong asset quality we operate with high capital ratios and we are well positioned to deliver strong earnings growth and industry leading profitability despite the headwinds facing the banking industry in our outlook is for attractive revenue growth and well controlled efficiency i wish to thank all our associates without whom our success would not be possible for over years our associates have strived to help our customers succeed and east wests strong results are reflection of their hard work and dedication i will now open up the call to questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions the first question today comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning ebrahim ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah i guess just one big picture question dominic clearly i think given what happened in march i think the question is are business commercial deposit customers a lot more sensitive around how they manage their excess funds or uninsured deposits whichever way you want to look at it has any of this changed in terms of how you strategically think about gathering deposits and what type of deposits you want on the balance sheet and how this may influence growth going forward dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well it really hasnt changed too much because we have always have a very strict principle in terms of we got to run our balance sheet in a very prudent conservative way and then no concentration in any particular industry no concentration on any particular one single client and so forth so you can see despite the turmoil well we down after two weeks of chaos the deposit down so its very different than the banks that may have a very very high exposure and then indiscernible customer base so our position is that so long that you dont have overconcentration in any one particular client then you will not be taking a very very big hit one way or the other now obviously if you look at for what happened after the last two weeks in march customers behavior changed and particularly if you look at in the private equity sector or vc sector the limited partners who may not be as familiar with the banks would probably talk to their general partner and they asked out hey you know what it is not a indiscernible bank maybe just not indiscernible they would rather take the money to some other treasury or some other sources just to make sure that they are parking their money in a safe place when they have no ability to figure out how the banks financial performance are and so forth again these are limited partners who do not have direct exposure interaction with the banks so for those type of customers there are two ways to handle it one is that we provide additional financial information just like we show our capital ratio we show the borrowing capacity which is 130someoddpercent higher than the east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 uninsured deposits and we show the granular deposit base consumer commercial accounts smaller balance all of that that we show to them and then we can somewhat help convince even folks who have no exposure with east west bank and they can get comfortable and thats one way the other way is the fully insured program like ics and cdars i mean for convenience it takes some time to sign them up for ics indiscernible so they are now insured they dont have to worry and so we do combination multiple different ways because for a long term we wanted to continue to have more people to understand who east west are and then also through this kind of interaction actually we are now getting more referrals more deposit customers limited partners that normally dont have anything to do with us because of this changing environment we need to reach out and after reaching out they say oh maybe we should start banking at east west so its all worked out just fine in the moment and so i encourage our team to do that but on the other hand we also want to make sure to expedite some of these customers concern and i would just provide them to a fully insured program this is combination of both so i think that part of the change is happening and obviously at this point a bit more indiscernible we still i do feel that not having overconcentration in any particular segment indiscernible as you are well aware we have like a vc deposit thats less than our pe deposit also very low so from that standpoint so even with these kind of like silicon valley banks indiscernible it doesnt hurt us like the way maybe to the other banks ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just a separate question around commercial real estate means its less about your portfolio you provided a great amount of detail but in a one do you share the concerns in the market around the outlook for commercial real estate the impact from interest rates office cre but maybe that could spread depending on the recession just how concerned are you in terms of the overall market backdrop for cre over the next year or two and how do you insulate these two as from just the market factors that could lead to a decline in loan to values maybe more defaults not at east west but it could have some secondary effects dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well just at this point it all depends on the interest rate environment so i would think that as the economies continue to slow down at some point the fed is going to have to drop rate once they saw drop in rate depending on the pace of how fast they drop rate that would affect relief to the cre market obviously we all know that there are a bunch of commercial real estate out there and there are a lot of them may be coming due and some of them have higher ltv some of them are in areas that have much higher exposure but by and large if you look at the small properties that are not in that highly concentrated like downtown metropolitan area in certain particular cities they those properties are going pretty well because business overall is not doing badly so people still need to have an office if you need to by the way commercial real estate is not just office buildings we have a lot of retail business going pretty well and there are warehouses customers still having a hard time to find warehouse space and there are also multifamily buildings that in many of the areas in united states have fully occupied so there are a lot of commercial real estate thats still going very well and for east west bank fortunately we have many of those so how the market would affect us so we always prepare for the worst so thats why few years ago several years ago we already started doing a complete scrubbing of our commercial real estate east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 portfolio again slicing and dicing to make sure that we do not have any overconcentration any particular area particular sector segment within a geographic area that we are concerned and making sure we do not have too many very large commercial real estate loans we do not have any huge one indiscernible and doing all those typical banking type of risk oversight and in addition to that very very proactively helping our customers to get interest rate swap so that while we are enjoying adjustable rate in the last year or so and thats even now enjoying just wide margin net interest margin our customers actually paying fixed rate so weve been very very proactive active for the last actually to years doing interest rate swap and i think that we do have a portfolio that quite frankly are much more immune against the high rate attacks for commercial real estate borrowers secondly as i looked at the current interest rate environment we looked at predominantly indiscernible and also the full year probably would be a more stressful year for the cre owners and when i look at our portfolio i believe that we only have of our cre loans coming due in and irene you correct me if im wrong i think next year will be irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats correct dominic dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah so this year next year we are in a much better position in terms of not having to deal with a lot of those big loans coming due first of all we dont have any big loans coming due secondly even with the whole portfolio its only coming due and next year well have coming due we have very very low loanto value and then many of our customers are in personal guarantee and so while we are working with some of these customers most of them they have so much debt service coverage ratio even when the rates revised to a new rate for refi its not that big an issue but for those properties that we think that may potentially be get a little bit more stressful when it comes to with a high rate we work with them to make sure they have at least months months of additional interest reserve or maybe making some of the additional down payment when you have customers have a high liquidity when you have customers have personal guarantee it just makes it so much easier to start that conversation and get that taken care of and thats why were so far working in a very orderly manner we dont have enough for us to even get too overexcited about it but we continue to work with our customers and one at a time and so far its been working out very well so i think overall that if we can get through next two years and most likely the environment will get better so from that standpoint i would say that yes no matter how much we keep it in a safe and sound manner theres always going to be outside factors that can affect the market as a whole that would also potentially impact us negatively however we always prepared for the worst to make sure we be proactive and do everything upfront and just stay ahead of the industry maybe by several steps so that we do not get caught like sometimes november this year or maybe june of knowing this may be coming and expect the worst and eventually getting the best out of it operator the next question comes from gary tenner with da davidson please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co good morning just thinking about longer term expectations regarding balance sheet management as i think irene noted the cash balance is quite a bit higher as a percentage of the balance sheet than they were at and understandably so how do you think about kind of a more permanent shift whether its cash balances or do you grow high quality liquid assets in the securities portfolio over time to increase at some more permanently elevated level irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc great question theres no question given kind of the market disruption this is something were evaluating i think we try to be prudent with this gary and in the current situation this is one of the reasons why we have borrowings and we kept the cash balances high indiscernible like billion aside from the other cash we have elsewhere so in the near term i would say probably given the market disruption that happened not that far in the past well keep that higher well continue to evaluate as far as securities and other hqla that we need gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thank you go ahead sorry dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i want to add just briefly with irenes comment here is that we just kind of like a disruptive market we wanted to be excessively prudent and thats why we went ahead and increased the cash balances and cash equivalent and then also went ahead and borrowed from the fed we dont have to do it we did it anyway because we can afford to do it with our current balance sheet with our capital ratios with our profitability and our return of equity and whatnot were in a position that we can afford to be a bit excessive in terms of making sure that indiscernible a very very small balance sheet because ultimately thats what matters to our customers when you look at the anxiety going on in the market back in late march when all these news media putting out news about regional banks are they all in trouble no quite not we do need to make sure that we demonstrate to our customers and that east west is the last thing they need to worry about and so if that means that we even show up more borrowing capacity why not right and then thats something that weve done it and so far so good gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co great thank you and then followup with regard to loan growth not shocking i guess that you lowered the loan growth outlook for the year just given the economic uncertainty et cetera obviously ci was lower in the first quarter but its a real seasonality for you could you talk about kind of where you think the contributions to loan growth come over the remainder of the year is it kind of specialized verticals is it single family kind of wheres that growth coming from east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc at this point i think our thought about this to loan growth guidance is that we just look at the current economy and we feel that the direction of this economy is that we may be continue to see our commercial clients paying down their loans so we saw we actually brought in a lot of new customers we just have a lot of existing customer pay down their lines which i understand because in this sort of like uncertain environment theyre not making aggressive investments they are not i mean theyre not looking into aggressively expanding or acquiring any companies and so forth so why pay this high interest rate and so many of them are paying down the loans thats why we see ci to actually slow down a bit not because we were able to gain new customers its really coming down to most of our customers in general just staying put and cre we dont expect much growth because we just i just talked about it with this kind of environment theres not a lot of deals that make sense if you have a lot of other customers from other banks who want to come to us for refinance its not going to be that easy to pass the entry level test from east west so therefore were not expecting much growth at all and the only one that we see so far still carry some decent momentum is on the single family mortgages and so far so good were still chugging along and our niche product and continue to attract customers very low loanto value indiscernible the convenience on east west bank and then so we are still generating decent amount of growth so far so we see i think at this point thats what we expect that the growth will be and well continue to watch the market and see how it goes and i look at it as at some point latter part of next year what this changes in the banking landscape i would expect that there may be some more opportunities for us to bring even more customers organic operator the next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc oh great thanks maybe irene a question on the strategy youre doing with the margin how should we think about just the level of downside protection into over the medium term given what youve been doing to reduce asset sensitivity if the forward curve plays out irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think in the medium term we dont see that much variability quite candidly with the nim in particular i think the largest variability is really going to come with the market pricing on the deposits i think some of the hedging strategies the balance sheet strategies were planning for and beyond quite honestly christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then maybe dominic for you you have youve just accumulated a ton of capital over the years are you seeing an opportunity over the next maybe to months to do something opportunistic or on the offensive i mean is there are you seeing stress in your markets with some of your peers that might avail an opportunity i presume buybacks arent a priority right now but just trying to think how this capital could be put to work for your shareholders thanks east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah well good question were always trying to be opportunistic we are we have a culture of irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc optimistic and opportunistic dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yes optimistic right now the market not very optimistic but then yeah were always trying to be opportunistic and whenever there is a great deal then i think that will be very very positive for our shareholders we always strike but on the other hand were very prudent because well never were never the kind that just jump into the playground and want to be the we just want to be the positive party and then end up getting burned and thats just something wont happen at east west so i do feel that maybe in the next to months probably have more opportunity than lets say the last few years but just because indiscernible more opportunity thats just a logical thinking whether that would be something coming up in our pipe or not i think i do want to point out is that you have always seen and there were many question asked before about why we didnt buy back when we have high capital as we this call will be a good sort of reflection because we arent prepared for just crazy thing like silicon valley bank signature bank just disappearing indiscernible that kind of scenario and if we did not have a capital ratio at this level or if we have overconcentration of customer base in one particular or two particular sectors we may be hurting in a similar way like a few other banks that they are experiencing right now so we always look at it as a balancing act the balancing act is that roe performing at one of the top performing level that we can look at ourselves and say that hey we done good for the shareholders therefore maybe we dont need to do too much but sort of like further pushing and this is what i always reflect on with us over return of equity over of roa i look at the regional banks around and then compare them with us i said wow were pretty good sp just gave us the number one best performing bank ranking last month so i look at it as were doing pretty good right now lets not overstretch ourselves and get way ahead of the pack so thats indiscernible as you heard from irene as we put up billion of these swap and collar right in the middle when were in the rising interest rate asset sensitive enjoying the margin expansion and instead of like going for 4pointsomewhatpercent margin increase quarter after quarter we dialed it back down we started dial it back down even early last year and we continued dial it back down even during this crisis and indiscernible million dialed it back down to me and the whole idea is that hey even with all of that we still cranked up over return of equity so why stretch because as long as we keep doing this balancing act managing the balance sheet prudently but being extremely aggressive in terms of ensure we perform to the best we can opportunity will come because we will eventually position ourselves with a level that will attract others and they maybe want to join forces with us so i look at it as we have no control of what other people will do we do have controls of what we can do and we keep working hard to make sure that we crank up one of the best performing metrics and then in the meantime making sure the capital stay high so we have all kinds of flexibility and then making sure liquidity stay high so east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 that well have all kinds of flexibility to do what we need to do and then managing the credit risk as the best we can so that we do not go sideways when the opportunity comes and thats what weve been doing for the last many years ive been in the bank for years now so just the sameold thing one crisis indiscernible crisis managing the same way one at a time and all worked up and so far so good operator the next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks for taking my question i just wanted to ask around the nii guide can you talk about what that would be if you take out the rate cuts in the back half there just given that the forward curve has come up a decent amount at quarter end i was wondering if there is any change in that tide irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question i think if that doesnt happen right now were modeling various scenarios given where just the high level of our rates are certainly one of the things i wanted to share is even if rates dont decline we are modeling that deposit betas will continue to inch up just realistically given this kind of environment so if that doesnt happen certainly there may be a little bit more relief there manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah any sense of quantification of what that would be irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc no i dont have that in front of me but i can share that with you after the call manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it okay and then as we think about credit you gave great color on cre by property type in the deck can you talk about the trends youre seeing with new property appraisals are you seeing that what kinds of declines are you seeing in those new property appraisals and then also if you have it how much of your portfolio has already been appraised for new values and how much of it is still appraised at the time of origination irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc thats a great question generally speaking we dont reappraise the existing loans but certainly theres market data that we get a simulation it really depends honestly property by property and when the loan was originated all in all and to a certain extent i dont know if averages are about meaningful here we dont see a substantial change if we estimate what the current as i mentioned i think loan by loan is more important but with that said i think with our underwriting criteria the low loantovalues that we originated it and what that means is strong cash flows as dominic mentioned in the prepared remarks were not seeing a lot of problems as east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 we continue to review these portfolios again and again its like a continuous review process id say its very positive that we do not see new surprises operator the next question comes from matthew clark with piper sandler please go ahead matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co hey thanks first one for me just on your office cre exposure appreciate the additional detail can you give us the reserve on office cre and is there any amount of that exposure thats criticized at this point irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question only we have the details on the total allowance we do have a little bit more allowance on the office cre on average i would say its about for the total portfolio about and ill just also mention a lot of that is in qualitative factors versus the quantitative on the credit side the level in general is very low of our office cre i think if i look at it i dont have the number off the top of my head matthew but its pretty consistent with the total criticized loans for the cre bucket which is about matthew t clark q analyst piper sandler co okay great and then the second one for me just on the change in accounting that eliminates the tdrs i guess what does this do for you does it provide you additional flexibility to work with the borrowers maybe by extending the amortization schedule and not having to call it a tdr any additional color there would be helpful irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats a great question and generally accounting changed offer more excitement for allowance and banks but not this quarter given what happened if you look at our allowance table thats part of our press release youll see that with the change in the accounting of tdr what this did for us is that we instead of individually looking at these loans for impairment if we look at it kind of a collective basis we added million of reserves and that was for about a million of performing tdrs and ill just note this is generally what we see with our loan portfolio when you compare the allowance for a pool and the different pd probability default loss given default calculations for some of them versus individually looking at them the individual allowance levels are a little bit lower but i think id just go back to the comment earlier the testament of the collateral for a lot of these loans that we have aside from that matthew your question on our workout strategy and the flexibility of that that its less of an issue for us we continue to do what we think is right for the property for the borrower and for the bank dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc again the amount is very small right now yeah operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist please go ahead east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good morning dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good morning irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc good morning brandon king q analyst truist securities inc so irene i just wanted to get your updated assumptions on the deposit mix and how it could evolve or progress from here throughout the year irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question and maybe the most topical one given the current environment given kind of the disruption in midmarch and where were at right now quite frankly we do expect continued modest kind of decline in dda balances right just realistically given the environment and the sensitivity around our core funding and the market pressure but with that said we are confident that well be able to continue to grow deposit balances from here with the diversification of our customers our different bankers and really also the resilience that we have seen were comfortable from that perspective and thats factored in with the nii guidance and what our expectation is for the full year brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and as far as your customers that have derivative contracts in place could you give us a sense of the duration of those derivative contracts and a better sense of as far as you know the magnitude of how many of those contracts are may be expiring this year or into the future irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah i dont have the duration of that off the top of my head there are over the course of the next couple of years some of the interest rate contracts are going to be maturing i think if you look specifically for cre its probably in the tune of maybe a few several hundred million operator your next question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 hey good morning i think maybe just following up on the comments around holding excess cash how should we be thinking about the appetite to hold on to the bank term funding facility is that really specifically allocated to those cash balances or whats your expectation for duration on keeping that outstanding irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah thats a great question i think obviously at this point in time were holding it on for holding on to it really from a conservative perspective well evaluate that right with our need for cash what happens with deposits and as we talked about in our prepared remarks at this point in time although obviously its not beneficial from nim its nii accretive so i think were just looking at that as really kind of a rainy day well evaluate that over the course of the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc ill also add from a monthly quarterly perspective on the securities book its million to million that were kind of winding down from as far as cash flow from that so well evaluate as far as other sources of cash as well aside from other funding jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats good color thanks and then maybe just have you noticed any change in the pace of capital exports coming from china or any change in the appetite of some of that capital moving or do you expect any going forward dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc not much its been slow for ever since the geopolitical tension has risen since trump administration its been slow i mean slowing down and then i would look at it is at lately i have not seen any sort of like a new development of new capital coming from china but we continue to work with business throughout asia so its not just single were not just looking at attracting new customers who are investing in us from china only so but at this point i would say more or less flat on the other hand i think that we will like to see how us economy continue to develop if were ever going to get into a somewhat of a mild recession or even maybe a deeper than mild recession i would expect that there will be interested parties throughout asia to have excess liquidity they will be looking at any opportunity of investing in us but in this kind of environment right now just in general not many interested investors have much appetite to make a move i think everybodys watching and then trying to see how this economy plays out and then at that point at some point i think people may see opportunity when that happen we obviously would have the opportunity to provide banking and financing services jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 thank you operator the next question comes from brody preston with ubs please go ahead brody your line is now open if you would like to ask your question brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc sorry about that i was still muted thanks thanks for taking my question guys irene i just wanted to follow up on the deposit beta commentary you had mentioned increasing beta assumptions within your guidance i just wanted to see if you could clarify what the base interest bearing deposit beta is currently versus what it was previously irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question so if we look at the betas right as of our cumulative beta for total deposits was for interest bearing it was this is where we thought wed be earlier in the year later in the year with the disruption we got there in a short period of time in a couple of weeks in march when i looked at the remainder of the year and were looking at our deposits the behavior the activity of the different segments we do think this is going to inch up from this point in time but honestly also many of our commercial deposits and our operating accounts that are compensating balances so although we do expect it to increase really probably modestly from here to like a low very low brody preston q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you thank you for that and then i did just want to ask on the deposit front i was just trying to indiscernible the intraquarter update with last quarter versus this quarter in particular just understanding the flow on the nonbroker deposits and so it looked like when you gave that initial update intra quarter that for nonbrokered deposits you were actually up like or something quarteroverquarter and then when i look at the deck it looks like for nonbrokered deposits just trying to back into the number you wound up finishing the quarter down a little over are those numbers accurate and i guess just can you give us a sense for if there were any specific verticals that drove that reduction in the nonbrokered deposits for the last few weeks of the quarter irene h oh a executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question intraquarter and we did get that update intraquarter in midmarch we were up consumer deposits were up and also commercial deposits were slightly modestly up kind of essentially stable so overall i mean i think since the failure of silicon valley there was some disruption around us i think the different segments and the sectors maybe not so particular but just overall and then also there were broker deposits that we had let run off in early march that we we brought some of those back operator the next question comes from jordan hymowitz with philadelphia financial please go ahead jordan neil hymowitz q managing principal philadelphia financial management of san francisco llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 hey guys thanks for

executive vice president chief financial officer east west bancorp inc on the trends for the march ill start with that jordan generally theyve been positive across the board for us so that certainly helps and ill just share indiscernible look at the quarter the impact to aoci right the benefit or the improvement was about quarteroverquarter and then we see that thats continuing in april as far as deposit trends i would say overall its about the same were kind of clawing back a little bit but overall its whats positive is that the pipelines are strong as dominic mentioned were continuing to open new accounts commercial accounts consumer accounts so thats something that we think is very positive as far as the momentum jordan neil hymowitz q managing principal philadelphia financial management of san francisco llc and then you commented dominic that youve been there years i believe youre one of the few people that have been in the industry longer than i have and youve also been one of the few in this massive downturn of stocks that have been buying back your own stock can you comment at all irene youve bought theres been some board members that have bought how are you guys view managements stock purchases with the price stock at these levels dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc i didnt quite understand the question is that are you talking about management buying back stock during jordan neil hymowitz q managing principal philadelphia financial management of san francisco llc indiscernible personally buying stock dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc well irene didnt coordinate with me so ive been so busy working but it was funny because so many customers talked to me about they got lucky on that one day when the stock price just went crazy i mean all the regional banks stock price went crazy i think for us like for like i guess maybe i dont know about because i wasnt even i think i wasnt even in town so but i had customers telling me about they were getting in at so excited about it i didnt even know it happened so but i look at it as our management is always in a position that we always take position as that this is our bank and our actions speak louder than everything else and quite frankly back in when we did the management buyout myself and the then cfo we came in and basically used our liquidity to put it all in east west bank and buying the shares at the same price like every investor who came in for that capital raise and so it worked out worked out great and we continue to put substantial amount of our compensation into performance stock that if we dont make the numbers we dont get the stock and those performance stocks are working out very well not just by the way for senior executives but in fact throughout the whole bank every single employee including parttime teller every single one get stock grant every single year since when weve completed our management buyout east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 20apr2023 since that day june of we started giving stock grant every year to every single employee exactly the same amount we started with a year and inching up to a year but every year every lunar new year we provide a stock grant to every single employee and this is something that worked out really well for east west every single 3000plus associate at the bank have stock ownership they believe that they are owner of east west bank we think our employees think that i work for them because they are shareholders so and that kind of like mutually beneficial relationship i think working out just fine for us so we will continue to look into opportunities when it comes to shall we buy and not buy and all that i mean were right now with all these sec stuff we try not to do too much as much as we we dont want to get into any kind of hassle lets put it that way jordan neil hymowitz q managing principal philadelphia
