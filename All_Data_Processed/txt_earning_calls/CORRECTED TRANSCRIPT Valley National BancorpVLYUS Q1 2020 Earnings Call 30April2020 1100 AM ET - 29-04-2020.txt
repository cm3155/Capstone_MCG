employees clients and communities amidst the covid19 pandemic mike will then offer details on the financial results cecl implementation and our recent liquidity initiatives before opening the call up to your questions the global health crisis brought on by the spread of covid19 has quickly changed our world in many ways for the first time our management team is hosting this quarterly call remotely this is consistent with our business continuity plan as well as the social distancing guidelines and work from home procedures that have become the norm covid19 has also brought significant and rapid changes to the operating environment for our company for the last few years we have messaged our ongoing technology transformation significant strength diversity and depth of our management team over the last two months these forces have come together and driven valleys swift and decisive crisis response our agile technology enabled a quick and effective workfromhome transition for of our nonretail employees further we leveraged our technology platform to create an efficient digital application process for the sbas paycheck protection program which i will highlight in more detail momentarily in february and early march our finance and treasury teams were quick to lower deposit costs in response to declining interest rates these efforts were made possible by an engaged and flexible response from our deposit operations team and branch network and helped to offset earning asset yield pressure and insulate our net interest margin during the quarter while we were well ahead of our local competitors in our deposit repricing actions we still saw strong growth this quarter in our noninterestbearing transaction and saving balances which speaks to the underlying strength of our entire deposit franchise these actions position us well from a margin perspective entering the second quarter our experience management team also quickly identified potential industrywide liquidity stresses and acted to fortify our liquidity position these actions and so many others in the last few months directly validate our strategic technology focus and our longerterm efforts to deepen and diversify our management team further i believe the current environment coupled with our success over the last couple of months reinforces the strategic vision that we have outlined one which encompasses leading technology infrastructure to support the human element of banking banks like valley are meaningful meaningful to our economy meaningful to our communities we provide a differentiated customer experience which blend technology with live bankers its not difficult to look to the future and understand the value of having a motivated and knowledgeable team supported by leadingedge technology to drive relationship banking before i turn the call over to mike i wanted to highlight a few of our other key responses to the covid19 environment with regard to our employees i previously mentioned that of our nonretail employees have been unable to work remotely this is required to coordinate a distribution of laptops other hardware and remote valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 support valley has also paid million in special bonuses to our hourly and parttime employees and agreed to cover of outofpocket medical costs associated with the covid19 virus from an operations perspective approximately of our branches are currently closed with the rest offering either driveup service or lobby service by appointment we quickly adopted a rotational staffing model in our branches which has helped us manage health risk and maximize our ability to consistently serve our clients there are three other key initiatives that i would like to discuss which illustrates our teams dedication to servicing our clients in these unprecedented times we are helping our commercial and small business clients take advantage of the various government support programs available to them most notably the paycheck protection program or ppp as details of this program emerged we mobilized to develop an online application solution this eased the application process for our customers and helped us effectively manage the loan submission process to the sba by the time the initial phase of the ppp was exhausted a few weeks ago valley had originated over sba approved loans totaling billion of volume to put this success in perspective our billion of volume is more than times the amount of ppp originations that would be expected based on valleys asset size our median originated loan size was approximately and roughly onethird of all of our applications were for those below this gives us a sense of our efforts to assist the smaller companies most at risk in the current environment we continue to work with our most challenged commercial and retail clients on forbearance solutions as of april we had approved forbearance request on nearly commercial loans covering billion as you can see on slide excluding taxi medallion deferrals of the approved commercial deferral balance were perpetuated loans we have also approved over consumer forbearance requests for nearly million of principal balances while we continue to work with our atrisk borrowers the inflow of forbearance requests has noticeably slowed in recent weeks earlier this month we proudly launched our community recovery cd program this onlineonly cd opportunity ph forwards social distancing efforts and provides an attractive rate to new and existing deposit customers valley is donating basis points of deposits raised under this program back to those in our communities most directly impacted by covid19 we believe this is the first deposit promotion of its kind we have currently raised nearly million in deposits under this program equating to a direct donation of back to our local communities we look forward to further marketing this program across our entire footprint and driving additional financial support back into our communities in addition to the community recovery cd we have committed to invest million in new jersey community capitals garden state relief fund to further support new jersey small businesses we have also donated to food banks in our footprint which have provided over million meals to those in need throughout this presentation we will provide additional information on our exposure to industrys potentially impacted by the virus and thoughts on the other potential implications to our businesses and mitigating efforts we have taken to address those impacts headon valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 transitioning now to the financial results in the first quarter of valley reported net income of million and earnings per share of these results include approximately million of aftertax merger expenses related to the acquisition of oritani and over million of infrequent expenses associated with valleys response to covid19 on a preprovision basis results reflect continued progress on our stated goals of consistent growth and improved operating efficiency on a yearoveryear basis we generated growth in adjusted revenue against only increase in adjusted expenses exceptional progress on these fronts was mitigated in the quarter by a larger provision reflecting the impact of covid on the economic outlook while mike will provide additional details we recognized a million provision in the quarter of which roughly was related to incorporating a weaker economic forecast into our reserve methodology at the end of the quarter even with this significant provision our adjusted earnings per share decreased only modestly from the first quarter of overall were proud of our covid19 response and our first quarter achievements despite the challenges of the current environment we will continue to operate the bank in the conservative manner that investors have come to expect and that has served us so well over our history our credit losses in the prior crises were lower than our peers as a result of our strong credit culture and prudent approach to underwriting while our geography has expanded since the last crisis our conservative lending philosophy remains unchanged we operate in resilient demographic markets that we expect will be quick to bounce back as the environment normalizes with this in mind we will continue to manage items under our control and position ourselves for sustainability and success as we emerge from these challenging times now id like to turn the call over to mike hagedorn for some additional financial highlights during the quarter michael d hagedorn chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp thank you ira turning to slide highlighting our quarterly net interest income and margin trends valleys reported net interest margin increased to from in the fourth quarter of the first quarters margin includes basis points of benefit from higher accretion on purchased creditdeteriorated loans that resulted from the implementation of cecl exclusive of this net interest margin on an adjusted basis was up basis points sequentially this is a continuation of the upward trend experienced in the fourth quarter of and reflects our success in quickly reducing nonmaturity deposit cost as benchmark interest rates declined in the quarter on the deposit side we continue to experience customer rotation out of cds and into noninterest and transaction accounts going forward we believe that there is additional room to reprice cds and wholesale funding sources lower as these liabilities mature this opportunity is outlined on slide earlier ira mentioned certain initiatives that we undertook during the quarter to build liquidity and ensure we have the balance sheet resources necessary to respond to our customers needs during these uncertain times in the last two weeks of march we added billion of fhlb advances with a weighted average term of months by utilizing slots on a portion of the advances the allin costs of these advances will be roughly basis points valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 subsequent to quarterend we added an additional million of shortterm fhlb advances and over billion of brokered cds with a weighted average term of months and a weighted average cost of as a result of our liquidity actions quarterend cash and equivalents exceed billion while this excess liquidity may produce a modest nearterm drag on our net interest margin we firmly believe that these efforts are prudent given the uncertain environment we currently face slide illustrates the swift reduction in nonmaturity deposit costs that we drove in march cd rates also trended lower in the quarter and as you saw from the 12month forward maturity schedule on slide additional opportunities exist to reprice retail cds and wholesale funding costs lower should the current rate environment persist on the asset side as you would expect we continue to see yields under pressure during the quarter reported loan yields declined basis points despite a basis point benefit from accelerated pcd loan accretion origination yields declined basis points from the fourth quarter of as a result of the significant reduction in benchmark rates in the second half of the first quarter despite this pressure new origination spreads increased to basis points in the quarter and are up nearly basis points in the last six months moving on our noninterest income increased from the linked fourth quarter driven primarily by a million increase in swap fees despite strong sequential growth adjusted fee income was of adjusted operating revenue during the quarter slightly below the prior quarters level this decline in the ratio is largely a product of strong net interest income growth partially attributable to a full quarters impact from the acquisition of oritani swap fees were approximately million during the quarter as we originated backtoback swaps on approximately million of notional loans up from million in the prior quarter going forward we would expect swap fees to return to a lower level reflecting less overall activity our net residential mortgage gain on sale income declined sequentially as the volume of loan sold declined to approximately million from million in the fourth quarter of on a positive note gain on sale margin increased more than basis points to which partially mitigated the volume decline slide provides an overview of our quarterly operating expenses and the significant progress we have made on the efficiency front our reported expenses decreased approximately million from the prior quarter this quarters reported figure includes million of mergerrelated expenses compared to approximately million of infrequent expenses in the prior quarter the pretax amortization of tax credit investments was roughly million for the first quarter of down from million in the prior quarter our adjusted expenses exclusive of tax credit amortization and previously mentioned infrequent items were million up million or approximately from the previous quarter roughly onethird of the sequential expense increase is due to million of covidrelated special bonus and cleaning costs accrued during the quarter as the oritani systems conversion occurred in midfebruary we expect full synergies to be recognized in the second quarter last quarter we told you that we were on track to achieve our adjusted efficiency goal below during as you can see we hit that mark this quarter with an adjusted efficiency ratio of as ira mentioned on a yearoveryear basis we have generated revenue growth with only an increase in adjusted operating expenses valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 while the covid operating environment is uncertain our management team remains focused on efficiently allocating personnel and financial resources to business lines and products that provide the greatest returns on our expense base total loans increased on an annualized basis to billion growth was strongest in our commercial categories with cre and ci increasing and annualized as one would expect given the environment we did see commercial line utilization which includes construction tick up to at the end of the quarter from in the fourth quarter of the most significant increase was noted in our florida markets since the end of the quarter line utilization has been relatively stable meanwhile our nonmortgage consumer portfolio declined on an annualized basis as both home equity and automobile balances fell from a timing perspective growth accelerated throughout the quarter and peaked at an annualized rate of in march loan origination in the first quarter totaled approximately billion up from the first quarter of since the end of the quarter covidrelated economic shutdowns in our markets have slowed both new originations and unexpected paydowns as traditional origination activity has slowed we have diverted resources to managing the demands of the paycheck protection program we received approximately loan requests under the ppp and under the first phase of the program we originated loans totaling billion our median loan size was approximately our expectation is that a large amount between and of loans made under this program will be forgiven and off our balance sheet in the near term the remainder could remain on balance sheet for two years as a reminder loans originated under this program are fully guaranteed by the government while the loans carry a modest yield the sba will pay lenders processing fees of between and per loan based on the size of each originated loan these fees will accrete through interest income over the life of each loan valley originated billion of sbaapproved loans in the initial phase of this program and has generated approximately million in expected processing fees from the sba this was an extremely successful initiative for valley and reflected the dedication and efforts of a significant portion of our team the overwhelming majority of our borrowers under this program had a preexisting valley relationship however in select instances we leveraged our ppp strength to service new clients in many cases these new clients brought significant deposit relationships to valley on slide we detail our outstanding loans to industries which have primary or secondary pandemic exposure approximately billion or of our loans are to industries that have primary exposure to the pandemic these include nonessential doctor and surgery centers the hospitality and foodservices industries and retail companies you will note that of our loans in these segments are currently rated pass under our credit methodology and we approved deferral requests on approximately of these loans we also have identified our exposure to industries such as manufacturing and education which may be less impacted by the virus again you will note the overwhelming majority of these credits are passrated indicating strong positioning prior to the covid outbreak while total deposits declined modestly in the quarter underlying trends were strong as customers rotated out of cds and into noninterest and transaction accounts noninterestbearing deposits increased sequentially on an annualized basis to comprise of total deposits up from in the fourth quarter of valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 similarly interestbearing noncd deposits rose on an annualized basis as a result of the quarters strong loan growth our loantodeposit ratio increased to from at the end of the fourth quarter while total cds declined billion from december approximately of that was due to the rolloff of brokered cds which we opted to replace with lower cost fhlb advances overall retail deposit retention has been favorable todate as mentioned subsequent to quarterend and consistent with our multiphased liquidity plan we added billion of brokered cds at favorable terms for the quarter interestbearing deposit costs fell basis points to this improvement reflects our decision to aggressively manage nonmaturity deposit costs lower as interest rates fell however as deposit cost reductions occurred late in the quarter it may be more useful to point out that in april our funding costs are trending approximately basis points lower than the first quarter largely as a result of enacting our liquidity plan total borrowings increased by billion in the quarter with the majority of that growth coming late in the quarter specifically in the last two weeks of the quarter we added billion of fhlb advances with a weighted average maturity of months as a result of utilizing spots on a portion of the advances the net cost to this billion is just basis points this quarter we have approximately billion of cds at a weighted average cost of and billion of brokerage cds at a weighted average cost of expected to mature assuming market rates remain relatively stable we would expect an additional repricing benefit from these maturities even as we continue to ladder out our funding sources to remain relatively neutral from an interest rate risk position slide of our presentation details our cecl implementation our allowance for credit losses increased nearly million between december and march with the increase coming in two phases on january our allowance for credit losses increased by million as a result of day cecl adjustments this was comprised of million for nonpcd loans and unfunded commitments and million for acquired pcd loans exclusive of the pcd reclassification the transition from incurred loss methodology to life of loan loss methodology added approximately basis points to our reserve then during the quarter we saw an additional million reserve build which increased our allowance inclusive of pcd to of loans this reflects a million provision and million of net chargeoffs roughly million of the quarters provision was related to lower valuations on taxi medallion loans another was due to the incorporation of updated economic forecast from moodys inclusive of the effects of covid19 into our multi scenario cecl model as well as the conservative reweighting towards moodys recession scenarios in general our economic forecasts assume a steep drop in gdp in the second quarter of and a relatively gradual u or lshaped recovery taking several quarters from an unemployment perspective our forecast generally assumes doubledigit unemployment for the next few quarters future provisioning activity will be largely dependent on the degree that economic outcomes track our expectations slide provides an insight into the quarters credit metrics on a reported basis our nonaccrual loans more than doubled to million or of total loans roughly of the sequential increase accounting for million was due to the reclassification of acquired pci loan pools to individual pcd loans with related loan reserves under the cecl methodology valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 an additional of the nonperforming asset increase was due to the transition of million of previously accruing taxi medallion loans to nonaccrual status during the quarter exclusive of these two items nonaccrual loans would have been unchanged at you can see the growth in our capital ratios and tangible book value on slide our tangible common equity ratio declined to from at december but remains significantly higher than a year ago the reduction from december is primarily a result of strong asset growth and our excess liquidity position we estimate that our excess liquidity dragged on our tangible common equity ratio by approximately basis points recall that the tangible common equity ratio was also impacted by about million as a result of the nonpcd portion of our day cecl adjustments we believe that we have sufficient capital to support our growth opportunities and to absorb additional provisions should our economic outlook deteriorate further and on the timing of ppp loan forgiveness we could see further tangible equity capital ratio declines in the second quarter all else equal we estimate that each million of ppp loans remaining on the balance sheet would temporarily reduce our tangible common equity ratio by basis points however we expect the majority of these loans to be forgiven in the nearterm and there will be no impact to regulatory ratios last quarter we provided guidance for key elements of our business on an annualized basis our first quarter results exceeded our guidance for loan growth net interest income growth and efficiency putting us on track for a very strong year however with the backdrop of this global health crisis we have decided to eliminate our guidance while we continue to learn more each day about the potential impact of this global health crisis on the banking industry and valley specifically theres simply too much uncertainty to confidently provide financial guidance to our analysts and investors with that ill now turn the call back over to ira for some closing commentary ira d robbins president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp thanks mike obviously our prepared remarks this quarter are somewhat different from what we have provided in the past these are unique and challenging times however i would like to reiterate that on all fronts valleys response to the crisis has been swift and decisive and early outcomes have been positive all largely reflective of the strong leadership team we have assembled i firmly believe in times like this our ability to be agile proactive in our focus steadfast in our strategy and commitment to valley will in combination be an unbelievable differentiator for valley and our shareholders we will continue to operate with a sense of urgency and navigate the uncertain future with an eye to the future and the unbridled opportunities now available with that id now like to turn the call back over to the operator to begin qa thank you valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from frank schiraldi with piper sandler please go ahead frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies good morning guys ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp good morning frank michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning frank frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies i wonder if you could talk a little bit about your provisioning your thoughts on provisioning going forward it sounds like you captured sort of a lot of what the models spend currently in terms of this first quarter provision but is there another leg up in your mind later in the year when you start to see some of these quantitative factors form in terms of whether its increased npas or ultimately increased charge offs thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp hi frank its mike ill take a stab at this one the cecl models regardless of who has them are primarily dependent upon the loss history so these are probability default and then loss given default models so the loss history that you have built into your model is going to be the primary driver of what your future view your life of loss loan would be however i do want to point out and i hopefully talked about this in my prepared remarks we made a change late in the quarter to look at a more severe scenario as more and more information was coming out related to covid and so we use a blended model of various economic forecasts from moodys to come up with that economic forecast and in the end that change resulted in gdp reductions of in the second quarter and u3 unemployment of which we think right now that should cover as we see it today the loan losses ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp and maybe just following up a bit on that frank if we were to use the moodys model as of midapril we have only seen about a million increase in what that reserve number was so i think we were pretty aggressive back to your point regarding the quantitative metrics i think thats the challenge for all of us in looking at what the reserves look like today were not going to know until third quarter until many of these loans come off of deferral as to what the impact is to some of these quantitative metrics that mike talked about before valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies all right okay and then just a followup in terms of as you guys are doing your internal stress testing when you look at your severely adverse scenario anything you can share with us in terms of how comfortable you are with what sort of capital cushion youre left with after losses in that scenario and how comfortable you are with the dividend in a scenario like that thanks michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp sure so if you look backwards at the severely adverse scenario we believe based upon that that our reserve would cover approximately times the cumulative severe loss rate from our looking at other people that have reported so far we think their numbers are closer to or so we think were in a pretty good position there and i would say ultimately the moodys s3 which would be the more significantly adverse scenario were at so on a relative basis we feel pretty good about where we came out frank joseph schiraldi q analyst piper sandler companies okay and then the dividend in terms of in those scenarios i would assume given where you come out that the dividend is part of that stress testing ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp absolutely we run obviously as mike alluded to a lot of different stress tests over the years a lot of them based on the severely adverse scenarios that were provided by the frb as well as our own internal stress tests focused on some of the other variables that we think drive performance within the organization right now when we look at those stress performances we think we have sufficient capital ill just highlight last year at this time we were sitting at as a tce to ta today were sitting at our tier leverage ratio went from to tier riskbased went to to if you go back to when we started back in 2007ish timeframe we were only seeing a tce of when we entered the last major recession so i think as an organization were in a much stronger position than we were previously operator thank you our next question will come from steven alexopoulos with jpmorgan please go ahead alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning this is alex lau on for steve ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp good morning alex alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 first question on nim so with pressure coming on from the earning asset yield side how do you think about how much deposit cost can offset this and what are you thinking about the trajectory of net interest income and nim into the next quarter michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp so first i would say that were working hard to protect our nim and we have some tailwinds i think that make us a little unique right now in the space first as you see on page or on slide number you can see the repricing that we have thats going to occur in the second quarter for both our originated cd book as well as the brokered cd book when you look at that and combine it with the nonmaturity and ph unbacked frankly all other deposit repricing that we did and we did that early when the fed reduced rates and we were fairly aggressive and as i said in my prepared remarks we went from a total cost on the nonmaturity side of ph another basis points down we think we are doing about as good a job there as we can to protect the nim while admitting clearly that on the earning asset side yields are going to go down but also we put floors in to kind of protect the nim there as well alex lau q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for that and then just on your slide where you give covid exposures by loan segment you mentioned that theres there secured by real estate in this breakdown in this table are there any segments that have a larger exposure to those not secured by real estate and could you give some color on credit quality if there is thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah sure this is tom iadanza yeah looking at those high risk and ill just pick the hotel and hospitality as the first one of our portfolio has requested and has been approved for deferment of that portfolio is secured by real estate with an origination loantovalue of when you kind of go down each and every one of these the only one that probably has a low percentage that retail trade which represents auto dealerships a little over of that portfolio is real estate secured the balance is floor planned but in general its not a big portion of the deferment its not a big portion of our overall portfolio in the restaurant space very similar trend to the hotel space pretty much secured by real estate loanto value more in the and in each of these categories we carry personal guarantees so we believe its fairly wellprotected but theres still uncertainty as to when they come out in florida the governor announced that hes going to allow restaurants to open shortly but with a lower occupancy than they would be normally permitted to have operator thank you our next question will come from matthew breese with stephens please go ahead matt breese q analyst stephens inc hey good morning ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 good morning matt michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning matt matt breese q analyst stephens inc just going back to the reserve is there any unamortized marks that you have and could you quantify that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp well theres billion of pcd loans remaining and the mark on that is million over eight years other than that no so matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp if you think about that thats going to we think thats going to level up obviously we dont control those if loans prepay and youd accelerate but no we think thats going to level off matt breese q analyst stephens inc and should we think about that million combined with the allowance as it stands today michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp you certainly could if you want to it obviously doesnt go through allowance it goes through interest income and then finds its way hopefully to retained earnings but you could matt breese q analyst stephens inc okay ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp it doesnt roll into our calculations on that so when you look at how were thinking about it when you look lgds and pds and what we think we need to reserve that million is definitely not a component of it matt breese q analyst stephens inc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 okay okay and then can you talk a little bit about what happened with the earlystage delinquencies this quarter commercial real estate especially what happened why the increase can you just give us some color on the larger credits and relationships that you referenced thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp sure its tom again there is about million increase in the commercial real estate space million of that was administrative current for payments but the loan had matured all of that has been renewed and is now off past due the remaining balance was just a mix of low loantovalue loans that are chronically late in that day bucket but they pay they stay within those buckets and our longtovalue on those is probably sub40 and theres no single large exposure within that category its a group of smaller loans operator thank you thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp indiscernible oh sorry go ahead operator no you go ahead sir thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp there was a residential piece in there and it was about million million of that is current for payment now and removed and the other were deferments requested prior to the end of the quarter but we didnt process until april operator thank you our next question comes from collyn gilbert with kbw please go ahead collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning everyone ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp good morning collyn michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp good morning collyn collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc just to touch on the reserves and your cecl outlook and kind of mike as youd indicated so much of what drives the cecl model is your historic loss rates and overall when you give that or so of your reserve now accounts for the moodys s3 forecast thats really impressive valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 i guess my question is just how are you quantifying the change in the book right i know ira and i know the culture at valley like you guys are so committed to your conservative underwriting standards but the really of it is is the books changed right you moved into different geographies a lot of the growth youve accelerated your growth over the last couple of years so you could argue latecycle asset adds just kind of walk us through how youre thinking about the change in the portfolio today relative to what it was pre and postcrisis ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp let me just start and ill turn it over to mike and tom look were definitely acknowledging we are in some different geographies than what we were in prior but keep in mind when we went into florida we were pretty selective about the banks that we looked to merge with and then weve been further selective as to the assets that we put on if you recall in the cnl transaction we actually ph throughout or not throughout but let run off about of the book just because it was in asset classes that we werent comfortable with we have a specific asset credit philosophy within this organization and that does not change irrespective of that geography that were in the borrowers that we look to those are the people that are the ones that are supporting the individual loans its not a transaction what the borrowers exposure is when it comes to contingent liabilities what their liquidity looks like these are our core philosophies that we have within the entire organization that we propelled across the entire geography that were in i think weve been in some of these geographies for a long enough time that the book represents how we lend who we are and not necessarily what traditional experience would have been for some other lenders in these markets i dont know if mike and tom have some other thoughts on that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp coming into this earnings season we knew that people were going to have a difficulty and when i say people i mean on the analysts side were going to have difficulty trying to look at what does allowance coverage ratio at valley what does that mean when you look at it across the universe of other midsized banks i would just point you to the fact that our allowance as a percent of loans increased from fourth quarter to first quarter and by our estimation our peer group only was up why is there a differential two things mostly driving this one the fact that we used a pretty severe moodys economic forecast a combination of several of their forecasts and then maybe more importantly to your question collyn we also use a we should have talked about this earlier we use a qualitative overlay on top of the model as well to account for things that arent accounted for in the history in the portfolio one of those being the florida portfolio as an example so we put on additional loss history for the industry because we dont have it ourselves to increase our reserves as well thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp and just to add a little bit to that collyn when you look at the metrics of our portfolio there is no concentration by region by loan type by size were still very granular our production in the first quarter our average real estate loan is less than million and our average ci loan is less than million so we continue to do the same things that weve always done valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 looking at it over of our business is generated from our longterm valued customers and the balance comes from new customers that we actively have been soliciting for years and are all wellknown to people within the bank so it is about relationship banking it is about knowing and it is about being very granular in how we proceed and how we do our business collyn b gilbert q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thats great additional color and then just my one followup to that would be and you sort of touched on this but just as we look at your slide where you go through the exposed loan segment obviously how florida and new jerseynew york are behaving through this pandemic are very different just curious as to if you have kind of the geographic split between whats up in these markets versus whats in florida in terms of your loan exposures and then also to where youre seeing deferral requests thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah sure the deferral request is pretty much along the lines of percentage of portfolio we have in each market were not seeing any higher in any one of the regions our hotel portfolio which i described earlier being real estate secured lower loantovalue going into this is for the most part more floridarelated than new yorknew jerseyrelated as is our restaurant portfolio which again i described as reliant on real estate at a loan to value other than that its as dispersed as you would expect within the regions operator thank you our next question comes from steven duong with rbc capital markets steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc hi good morning guys just going on that regional breakout do you guys have the breakout of whats actually in new york city itself for that covid exposure thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yes we have it broken out by location and by type the largest exposure in new york city that were realizing are ambulatory centers we dont have a big restaurant or hotel exposure in new york city if any at all so its mostly ambulatory centers which is a relatively small dollar amount i think its in the million range where we have those in the manhattan market we break it into three of it is affiliated with large hospital systems or necessary care being cancer treatment or knee replacement and is broken into elective surgery so when you look at that the hospital affiliations will be fine and theyll come back the necessary care will be fine and theyll come back the cosmetic care will take a little bit longer to come back each of that portfolio is secured that portfolio carries guarantees from the state hospital systems as well as the physicians that ph are all in on the latter category well we havent really seen much in office we havent really seen much in multifamily coming out of the manhattan market steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 great thats appreciate the color on that and then your cet1 ratio just declined a little bit was that just purely the adoption of cecl ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp i think that was a little bit of the adoption of cecl but keep in mind also we put on additional liquidity during the period and the additional liquidity had a negative impact as well during that first quarter steven duong q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thanks ira ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp yeah thank you operator thank you our next question will come from david chiaverini with wedbush securities david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hi thanks couple of questions starting with the discussion on nim it was mentioned earlier in the call about how the deposit inflows positions valley well for the second quarter and then later on it was mentioned about how the excess liquidity thats coming on the balance sheet could pressure nim in the second quarter and then furthermore april funding costs being down basis points is certainly a good thing its a long way of saying are you willing to disclose how much when we look at april the earning asset yield are you able to disclose how much the earning asset yield is expected to come down thus far in april michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp not at this point obviously because were disclosing first quarter results but clearly the pressure of just waves coming down generally are putting pressure on our earning asset yields and as we said we have a lot of cash built up you might ask why did we do that early on in this crisis we decided that putting on some amount of liquidity was just prudent because it was so uncertain as to where this was going to go and keep in mind that was before things like the ppp liquidity facility even existed so one of the things that we feel clearly pretty strong about is we have the ability right now to fund all of our ppp loans with the liquidity weve built up without even using any of the governments facilities now we may do that im not saying we wouldnt use it im just saying that our liquidity build put us in a position where we had options david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc thats helpful thanks and then my followup is on expenses you mentioned about how the full synergies from oritani should be achieved in the second quarter with the conversion the systems conversion in the first quarter can you remind us how much in expense savings youre expecting to get from that michael d hagedorn a chief financial officer senior executive vice president valley national bancorp valley national bancorp vly corrected transcript q1 earnings call 30apr2020 well have to get back to you with an exact number i can give you one of the main components of it that i think you would probably care to know about oritani salary expense for the month of december remember we only had them for about one month in the fourth quarter was million and so on a quarterly basis that would be million the oritani salary expense in the first quarter was only million so thats roughly and i know on a total basis our total cost savings right now are running around just in the first quarter so were almost all the way there and well get the rest of that in the second quarter thomas a iadanza a senior executive vice president chief banking officer valley national bancorp yeah and just to add we identified between oritani and valley nine branches to be closed through the integration and merger and those branches werent closed until march ira d robbins a president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp and if you keep in mind those numbers werent even in the forecast of cost save that weve provided so weve already well achieved many of the cost saves or actually all the cost saves that we identified when we announced the merger i think to toms and mikes point the economic benefit is going to be much more recognized in the second quarter than what it is in the first quarter operator im showing no further questions in the queue at this time i would now like to turn the call back over to management for any further remarks ira d robbins president chief executive officer director valley national bancorp so we want to thank you for taking the time to listen in i know our prepared comments were a little bit longer than what they usually are i know the document that we provided is a little bit
