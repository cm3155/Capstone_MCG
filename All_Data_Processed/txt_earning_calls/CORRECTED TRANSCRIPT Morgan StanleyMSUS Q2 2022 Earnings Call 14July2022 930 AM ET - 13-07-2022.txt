time im in london sharon is in new york so if we have any logistical gaps for a second or two please understand but i think well be just fine morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 the firm delivered a very solid quarter against obviously what is a more challenging backdrop businesses proved resilient reflecting an important aspect of our strategy and that is to as weve said many times deliver stable performance in a difficult environment while remaining wellcapitalized the integrations of etrade and eaton vance continued to expand our opportunities to reach new clients grow assets and support the firms overall stability net new assets in wealth management of over billion despite the volatility and clients taxrelated withdrawals in the quarter underscored the scale of our business and its power to attract assets and in the face of a sharp decline of equity markets wealth management delivered a strong pbt and improved margin supported by the benefits of rising rates investment management benefited from its diversification and we saw continued momentum in private alternatives parametric customized portfolios and the countercyclicality of our money market business finally in institutional securities our strong franchise in equity and fixed income helped materially counter what everybody knows to be limited activity across investment banking our results this quarter also reflected two notable headwinds that are worth calling out first we saw a significant movement in the investments related to deferred cashbased compensation plans while the marks on these investments are substantially offsetting compensation expense they created significant drag on top line revenues in the quarter across the firm particularly in wealth management where the impact to revenues exceeded million secondly the quarter results also included the legal costs of million that reflects the likely resolution of regulatory investigations by the sec and the cftc regarding employees use of unapproved personal devices and the firms recordkeeping requirements this has been the subject of industrywide scrutiny our rotce excluding integration expenses for the deals that weve done was down in q1 and from last year as i said at the outset our objective to demonstrate resilience and balance in a more difficult economic cycle was achieved this quarter helped in part by the acquisition of etrade and eaton vance in what was otherwise a challenging environment finally the feds stress test further affirmed our differentiated business model our diversified business mix as well as our strong capital position provide us the flexibility to invest in future growth and support our robust capital return program as such we increased our quarterly dividend by and announced a billion multiyear buyback program having a dividend thats aligned to the more stable earnings from wealth and investment management is a leading priority of this firm and by the way at todays stock price the current dividend has a yield of approximately with the buyback we wanted more flexibility than an annual fixed commitment allows given the nature of our business model its especially appealing to have this additional flexibility to deploy capital of what we believe to be attractive valuations ill now turn the call over to sharon and as always at the end well take your questions sharon yeshaya chief financial officer morgan stanley thank you and good morning the firm produced revenues of billion in the second quarter our eps was and our rotce was excluding integrationrelated expenses our eps was and our rotce morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 was our results reaffirm the stability of the franchise against the challenging backdrop and the benefits of a balanced business model the integrated investment bank continues to serve clients evolving needs in a dynamic environment wealth management benefited from its scale and rising rates despite the decline in global asset prices our expanded product set in investment management proved supportive to that business the firms yeartodate efficiency ratio excluding integrationrelated expenses was this includes the million legal matter related to the firms recordkeeping requirements that james discussed given the broader market uncertainty and inflationary environment we are focused on discretionary spend while balancing continued investment initiatives and ensuring the right controls are in place to support future growth as a management team our priority is to diligently address what we can control given the market realities we will continue to review incremental spend as we regard efficiency as a critical performance objective now to the businesses institutional revenue of over billion demonstrates the power of our balanced franchise against a difficult market backdrop revenues declined from the exceptionally strong prior year while the backdrop was challenging for investment banking particularly underwriting fixed income and equities led the strength of the quarter as clients navigated volatile markets investment banking revenues were billion down significantly from the prior year heightened volatility led clients to delay strategic actions and new issue activity advisory revenues were million reflecting lower completed ma volume equity underwriting revenues declined to million results were in line with global equity volumes which fell meaningfully versus the prior year fixed income underwriting revenues were million also down compared to the prior year as bond issuance was muted across both investmentgrade and noninvestmentgrade companies the investment banking pipeline remains solid conversion to realized will largely be dependent on market conditions and corporate confidence equity revenues were billion reflecting the strength of our business against a volatile backdrop prime brokerage revenue technical difficulty operator please continue sharon yeshaya chief financial officer morgan stanley our revenues declined versus the prior year and reflected a loss of million marktomarket losses on corporate loans heldforsale including event loans offset by gains on hedges were million this reflected the widening of credit spreads notable declines in deferred cashbased compensation plans compared to gains in the prior year also contributed to the decline turning to isg lending as a reminder over of our isg loans and commitments are either investmentgrade or secured our institutional securities group credit portfolio continues to perform well our funded ratio on corporate loans stands at approximately in line with prepandemic levels and well below the first quarter peak of approximately morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 turning to wealth management by several measures performance was strong despite the volatile backdrop we reported revenues of billion results were meaningfully impacted by movements in dcp which reduced revenues by million in the quarter excluding the impacts of dcp revenues increased from the prior year to billion a new record the decline in dcp was substantially offset by a reduction in compensation expense excluding integrationrelated expenses pbt was robust at billion and the margin increased to the margins resilience in a turbulent market environment serves as evidence of the strength of the franchise and the benefits of our business mix including the growth of our banking offerings transactional revenues were million excluding the impact of dcp transactional revenues declined lower revenues reflect a moderation of client activity from last years elevated levels and limited new issuance selfdirected daily average trades remained well above etrades preacquisition highs asset management revenues of billion were up modestly versus the prior year driven by strong feebased flows realized over recent quarters feebased flow assets were billion in the quarter and feebased assets now represent of our advisorled assets total net new assets were billion in the quarter bringing yeartodate nna to billion representing a annualized growth rate tax outflows were roughly double that of recent second quarters and yet asset generation remains strong and balanced nna was driven by existing and new clients in the advisorled channel stock plan vesting events positive net recruiting and selfdirected channel inflows bank lending balances grew billion in the quarter driven by securitiesbased lending and mortgages we continue to expect fullyear loan growth of billion deposits declined billion in the quarter to billion the decline was associated with seasonal tax outflows and the deployment of ratesensitive cash the outflows were largely in line with our expectation the average rate of deposits increased to basis points this was driven by an increase in saving account rates and deposit mix net interest income was billion up notably from the prior year driven by higher rates and continued strong bank lending growth looking ahead to the second quarter nii is now a more reasonable exit rate going forward while the magnitude of rate hikes is not certain if the forward curve is realized and our model assumptions materialize we estimate million of incremental nii to be spread over the upcoming two quarters weighted towards the fourth quarter turning to investment management revenues were billion against a challenging public market environment our results demonstrate the benefits of our diversified product mix particularly with strength in our portfolio solutions led by parametric customization and private alternative funds as well as our liquidity offerings weve built a portfolio that provides balance across various market environments the benefits of these efforts were apparent in the quarter total aum was trillion longterm net outflows of billion primarily reflect recurring headwinds in equity strategies but were partially offset by strong demand in alternatives and solutions particularly in parametric customized portfolios collaboration with our wealth management business as well as other us wealth management platforms is a driver of strength of our customized offerings liquidity net inflows exceeded billion we have invested in our liquidity business in the past decade which has positioned our franchise well to benefit from the current rising rate environment asset management and related fees were billion the impact of lower aum was partially offset by higher liquidity fee revenue as rates came off of a zero bound performancebased income and other revenues were million in the quarter we saw broadbased gains in our private alternatives portfolio with particular strength in infrastructure and the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 energy sector investment the decline versus the prior year was driven by movements in dcp and markdowns on public investments overall our integration with eaton vance continues to progress well we have seen early success in leveraging our global distribution across our combined businesses turning to the balance sheet total spot assets declined from the prior quarter to trillion our standardized cet1 ratio was up basis points versus the prior quarter standardized rwas notably decreased to billion from the prior quarter as we manage our exposure efficiently across our businesses amid a market decline the result was a reduction in rwas of billion oci related to our availableforsale securities portfolio reflected an increase of unrealized losses of billion while this should be earned back over time it reduced our cet1 ratio by approximately basis points in the quarter our supplementary leverage ratio was during the second quarter we completed our billion buyback plan that we announced last year the most recent stress test results further reaffirmed our durable business model and we announced a dividend increase of and a billion multiyear repurchase authorization looking ahead while the second half of the year remains difficult to predict we are focused on our underlying business drivers lower asset values will impact revenue in both wealth and investment management however in wealth management rising rates are already driving nii higher supporting performance and net new assets remain healthy in investment management the diversification across fund strategies should continue to support results what we do not know is how much volatility we will see in the coming months and how it will impact our institutional securities business however our competitive positions remain strong and we remain close to our clients while they assess current valuations and the overall environment with that we will now open the line up to questions morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions well take our first question from christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst sanford c bernstein co llc thank you good afternoon james i guess and then good morning sharon maybe id start on the macro james its a very confusing time on the macro front there are some positives but a ton of headwinds i mean obviously this quarter was unusually noisy for morgan stanley and i think you kind of put up your lowest roe in almost two years so just curious how youre thinking about the macro backdrop how is ms positioned for that backdrop maybe how you think about your pathways to achieve some of your longerterm targets in the current backdrop thanks james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley sure thanks christian i think you hit it on the head the environment if i had to use one word to describe it it would be complicated we have the russian invasion in the ukraine obviously a historic occasion we have historically low rates with very significant rate increases going around the world weve got the tale of covid weve got obviously the fears of inflation and actual inflation weve got enormous political change just here in this country the uk where i am at the moment they had leadership change a few days ago supply chain issues chinaus relations et cetera so yeah very complicated i think its important to say though it is not complicated this is a different type of financial stress in the system and frankly the banking sector is much stronger than it was going into the last time we went through a major reset in morgan stanley is in particular i wont speak for others but were specifically in much better shape were along the us in our businesses largely because wealth management is almost entirely us and the us is yet again sort of a great region to be in in the world and yes while we might head into some form of recession and i like many others have tried to handicap it but were frankly guessing at this stage but i think its unlikely to be a deep and dramatic recession at least in the us i think asia is a little behind it depends how covid rolls out and its sort of reemerging a little bit in some countries and then europe obviously is fighting the hardest right now because of the war in the ukraine because of the pressure on gas and gas prices and so on so when i look at morgan stanley to sort of add it all together we did exactly what we wanted to do this quarter yes its the lowest roe for a couple of years after i think three consecutive record years but hey this is the most difficult environment weve been in decades so im okay with a lower roe particularly when it has a ten handle on it we have cet1 capital ratios of basis points above our requirement our rotce was nearly if you look at the wealth management margins we did a margin including integration this quarter without it those numbers were unheard of a few years ago so you add it all together the environment very complicated lots of uncertainty but frankly for our business model i think we fare relatively well and evidence of that is our confidence in the future and im sure well talk about that in terms of capital and so on christian bolu q analyst sanford c bernstein co llc okay thank you james maybe sharon on some more specifics around the buyback just thinking about how youre thinking about buybacks in the second half of the year i mean your cet1 did grow quarteroverquarter morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 but i think ph a lot of that was rwa declining indiscernible cet1 dollars are still falling theyve been falling for a while so i dont know can you maintain the sort of billionish buyback a quarter going forward or any more specifics around how long it will take to exhaust that billion in buybacks you announced sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley well multiyear obviously means more than one year so sort of just to put that in perspective but i think that the most important thing about the buyback and also the capital more broadly is weve been very prudent and efficient around our capital usage i think that weve always said that capital is very much tied to strategy theyre one and the same and so we think about them holistically when we think specifically about the buyback and the concept of a multiyear repurchase plan right two points one we did complete our old authorization so therefore we had to announce a new authorization and in addition to that the point is we provide ourselves with tremendous flexibility in an environment such as this one where there are as james said multiple macroeconomic factors but also a commitment to continue to return capital to those shareholders be that both in the evidence by the increase in the dividend and i think that what were looking for is really is flexibility around the capital repurchase plan james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i just want to add something i mean it was an important move to billion number and we said multiyear for a reason obviously were not going to do that in one year but we have enormous flexibility quarter to quarter now and thats really important and with basis points of capital excess we can use some of that flexibility listen the stock is trading i dont know what it is this morning or something it was a couple of months ago i like buying the stock at and by the way every time you buy a share at youre retiring a dividend worth so theres a sort of virtuous circle were averaging about of shares outstanding net were buying back plus a dividend shareholders getting great return with that getting out of bed so this is a statement of confidence of a our capital position and b the resilience of our business model operator thank you well take our next question from glenn schorr with evercore glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks maybe just a followon on the buyback convo and broaden it out when you look across all the big g sibs lots have high im sorry indiscernible lots have higher gsib buffers coming capital deficiency to their targets and dont have the exit that you have so i get it buy back cheap stock is great are there any other options that you ponder like maybe using that capital to grow share in any parts of the business or just save for a rainy day like im curious on how that dynamic works being one of the only ones with excess position james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley well glenn this is sort of the ultimate question weve built through a decade of frankly hard work and discipline a great excess capital position not for nothing along the way we did two major acquisitions so were using it on deals and two small ones solium and mesa west you recall the majors of course etrade eaton vance morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 weve taken the dividend last year we doubled the dividend and this year we took it up another it wasnt so long ago our dividend was a quarter the incremental change this year is a quarter so were investing in the business everywhere particularly around the workplace retirement space weve invested in the digital bank and building out the wealth space weve invested in asset management and our capability and were going to be doing more of that taking the eaton vance funds internationally expanding the parametric program and then were investing in banking i mean obviously the banking calendar has been terrible the last few months but thats not were interested in the next years not the last few months so the only thing we havent done with excess capital is do a special dividend and thats something im just personally not a fan of i think its like giving shareholders a problem and saying we dont know what to do with that money hey you take it so what we like to do with that money invest it in the business check give you a smart dividend with a yield check and do buybacks and have flexibility around it when the stock is trading the beginning of the year for every x dollars weve spent we got four shares retired now were retiring five shares i like that glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi cool i appreciate all that james a followup on wealth management sharon thank you you gave color on new money coming into which types of accounts and new clients im curious what are they doing with it in other words is it sitting in cash are cash positions higher than they usually are what products are they going to and then thirdly youre the largest gatherer of alternative assets has this market brought any noticeable impact to that opportunity on the wealth channel thank you sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley sure let me start with the last no change in opportunity i think we continue to actually work very closely with different alternative managers as we go forward and think about educate fas educate fas to educate their clients and use that relationship to continue to create the right products for our clients all based on education for both channels in terms of what are they doing with that money i think what you do see is a lot of the money ends up moving into feebased over time right so look at the fact that we aggregated all these net new assets over recent quarters that first often does come into the system as cash when theyre brought over and then that cash is then deployed into various types of feebased asset accounts i think its worth noting and just repeating that those feebased assets are now of our advisorled channel and those assets which is a big move from those somewhat low that we had seen in previous years in terms of very specifically what weve seen over the course of the first half of this year in terms of different types of product we were sitting at the end of the fourth quarter with cash levels at around to around the self directed and the advicebased channel were now at around of course that can be reflective of some of the equity asset values and the other asset values coming down to increase but there is somewhat of there is a pause i think people are waiting and observing in certain markets to deploy that cash and i think thats just you can see that in the transactional coming down a bit and darts coming down a bit but i dont want to suggest that the engagement isnt there because we still are at levels where our engagement as thought about by some of these dark metrics and just what weve seen in transactional its still higher than levels where we were from a pre pandemic basis so people are engaged people are active and they are seeking advice from their fas morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 operator thank you well take our next question from steve chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning so i wanted to ask a followup james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley good morning sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley hey steve good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi wanted to ask a followup question on the deposit outlook as you noted in the prepared remarks just lots of crosscurrents this quarter on the deposit side tax seasonality cash sorting and maybe some offset from higher market volatility and given the nii guidance sharon that you had laid out i was hoping you could speak to what youre assuming for deposit betas and the deposit growth trajectory given the myopic focus on cash sorting and recognizing that you already laid out some pretty explicit guidance on the loan growth side sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think what you just noted at the very end is very important because all of this is weighted into that nii forecast right deposit betas is just one piece of that conversation the behavior and then also how we continue to build in and aggregate be it new assets through nna and also various types of as you call it cash sorting but the movements of cash between products and that behavior of deposits specific to your question around the beta as weve said we are informed by the last rate hike cycle and it does have to do with the weighted beta at which i had noted last quarter and will just reiterate again this quarter it really has to do with the deposit composition mix that we have so we have obviously still accumulated very increased levels on those smaller accounts with smaller account levels and we might have other accounts where weve seen larger inflows into larger accounts right so account balances that are higher might also have gone up over time and that helps to explain the deposit beta which we see now based again as i said on that deposit composition mix it will not just be though of course around deposit beta a lot that is embedded into the forecast as i said has to do with how we see those deposit behavior moving over time and again a lot of that is informed by what we saw in the last rate hike cycle steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful color sharon and maybe just a followup on the earlier discussion on organic growth i mean the number which considering the more pronounced tax seasonality elevated market volatility was certainly an impressive result if the market volatility persists should we view this as a reasonable floor on organic growth morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 and i was also hoping you could just speak to the cadence of flows from april to june just to give us a sense as to how organic growth is trajecting over the course of the quarter sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley well the cadence is obviously youve seen more in the second two i mean youve seen a different mix right in the second two months than the first month because you had a tax outflow season so that kind of gives you the change in the two numbers i think what we have seen is a you have a lot that comes in from a flowbased basis is just if you think about workplace youre going to see that development and continue as people have exercised their options they continue to move forward so there are various types of offsets i think whats important as we look forward in terms of where is the floor look weve said historically we dont expect to be in that very low single digit range which we were before the acquisition of etrade we said that was too high so that kind of gave you that middle range exactly how it will pan out what i can say to you is its still healthy and we still feel wellpositioned as it relates specifically to other indicators that you might think about for example recruiting the recruiting pipeline remains healthy and what we often see and tactically anecdotally is when those recruits come over they could be in a market volatility event actually be quicker to begin to bring those assets that were held away into the channel why because theyre seeking to be with their fa through that adviceled channel more immediately so as you called it there are crosscurrents and i think theyre important to bear in mind in this environment operator thank you well take our next question from dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning wanted to follow up on investment management and the fee outlook you have obviously beta working against you on some of your higher fee products but you have fee waivers coming off on the money market side so as you think about mix and client behavior going forward how do you think about the fee rates in that business longer term sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley its a great question im sure youll see the disclosure also that will come out in the q specifically for this business but just to give you a sense the fee rates themselves havent changed what has changed is the mix of the actual flows themselves so weve seen a decrease over the course of the last few quarters in some of those equity accounts for example which as is disclosed can have higher fees but what we have seen is an increase in balances and things like liquidity where were now not seeing those fee waivers since weve moved off that zero bound floor we had given you previous guidance of million that we expected to see as an incremental fee positive over the course of the year as those waivers went away because rates came off of that zero bound we stand behind that guidance and you continue to see that flow into the numbers i think though what is important is obviously where could you see things change is the liquidity balances right its a ph rate times balance question as ive said before and the balances in this case i think is a testament to the amount of time and the investment weve put into this business to find relationships also across morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 the integrated investment bank where weve worked with partners in institutional securities for example to help forge relationships that will help bring in some of those deposits into those money market products daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc great thank you and then just as a followup given the backdrop were in where revenues are a bit more challenged or uncertain as you think about noncomp expense and you highlighted being focused on this area and being efficient but have you proactively started to make decisions around spend and cutting back or as you think about that flexibility in the back half of the year is there a way to quantify levels of growth or lack thereof and any changes sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley so the first point that i would highlight to you is that exintegration our efficiency ratio is at and that includes the legal charge that james mentioned this quarter so i think we have shown and continue to demonstrate discipline around our expense base very similar to the way we think about capital resources we think about it very holistically and part of our strategic decisionmaking process as we walked into the second quarter we were aware that the environment was changing and we all had been seeing the same events that weve all witnessed together as it relates to geopolitical front and the macro side and we came in and we took a look a hard look and we continue to do so individual product by product investment by investment project by project to understand where are the potential growth and expenses coming from how are we thinking about balancing as james said that nearterm investment making sure that we need to get done certain things we always need to ensure that as we invest also with a longerterm horizon the right controls are in place as we continue to grow the business efficiently but are there projects that can be delayed that we might be doing on the margins so id say that that work is in flight has been in flight its not new information and its certainly something that were keeping our eyes on operator thank you well take our next question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch good morning sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch just wanted to follow up on the institutional securities business so you talked about a market share opportunity that you clearly have would love to hear your thoughts around just the health of one hows the plumbing in the capital market functioning we saw a bunch of headlines around hung deals et cetera during the quarter so just how are clients holding up on the institutional side and given how strong the franchise already is on the prime brokerage side is there more opportunity there i realize that was a big driver of the growth this quarter so would love to hear your thoughts morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley from basically in terms of the capital market functioning as james said were not in a position of the same kind of stress weve seen in other necessary cycles were still seeing functioning markets you can see that in just some of the funded balance points that i made across the isg portfolio in terms of funded balances being at versus even in the pandemic we had seen those balances up to so i would certainly say that you see institutions that are in a good place i also think from a corporate perspective it is worth noting that many came into this from an environmental perspective in a much better position than they have before because they did issue and were in a good spot from a balance sheet perspective in a period of low rates that you saw over the course of last year of course there are days where its more difficult to come to market that is very clear as you see that in the underwriting results so just to provide that balance of course its not the same thing as having a green screen every single day but i think that you are seeing both institutions and corporations et cetera taking advantage of days where the market is open and they are able to do that and from that perspective the market is functioning as it relates to prime brokerage weve been very balanced in that business i think weve been a tremendous leader in that business and we continue to effectively look for the relationship that were wellsuited for both in this environment that makes sense to partner with clients you see that on the balance side you see that on the revenue side and you see that the mix also matters to us and so from that perspective weve been very focused on the equities business more holistically for over a decade now ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bank of america merrill lynch thanks for that and just on the fixed income so appreciate that you all rightsized the business a few years ago like given the capital constraints at your peers does it make sense maybe james or sharon to like lean in and revisit areas where you could actually pick up share on the fixed income side or no james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley listen theres always opportunities to and environments where you can try and pick up share were in a bit of an uncertain world as i opened with i dont think this is the time to be overly aggressive personally i like the fact we have excess capital i like where our cet1 ratio is obviously as you drive up rwas you eat into that we actually brought up rwas down by billion this quarter i think the institutional team in both fixed income and equities were very prudent and appropriately so so listen if the option is to trigger another basis points on the scb or generate i dont know million million in revenue that for me is a very easy call right now i like the basis points that we havent had to trigger that some of our competitors have so listen well be eyes wide open but were not trying to win the game right now the fixed income business has gone from doing i dont know what they were doing million million a quarter in the back half of and were consistently at somewhere between billion and billion theyve done a phenomenal job theyve materially gained share i think were around share up from or lower in those days stable business great leadership so yeah well be opportunistic but were not going to be greedy operator thank you well take our next question from brennan hawken with ubs morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions i wanted to follow up on steves questions on deposit beta but rather talk about the balance side of things so the brokerage sweep deposits declined by about billion this quarter sharon i think you referenced that was driven by both tax payments but also some yield seeking could you maybe break that down a little bit or do you have a sense about what that attribution would be just so we can kind of level set and think about how much further potential deposit deposit loss there could be from further yield seeking sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i think the better i mean i think that one quarter would be a little bit difficult to kind of draw those conclusions i think the way i would think about it brennan is a little bit differently which is some of the questions i know weve received are well why didnt your beta come down because you had etrade and so those balances should be in a position where you should have an average weighted beta thats lower over time so i think the best way to kind of answer your question a little bit more head on in terms of where the underlying crux is is we have seen balances also increase in the higher account level thats built into the model its built into our expectations its built into the nii forecast and weve said as i said directly in my remarks we also saw deposit behavior very much in line with what we expected and so it is working in terms of that predictability but why is the beta then higher some of that beta just has to do with you have some higher balances why because you accumulated them likely at periods of time where yields were lower and there was excess cash that was sitting in position and so some of that higher balance amount begins to leave seeking out higher yielding payments so i think that can help give you a little bit of construct in terms of whats going on from the balance perspective to more directly i think answer the question rather than just look at one quarters behavior brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sure sure okay thats fair thank you and then when we think about the sbl book you flagged the billion of continued loan growth so it seems like youre expecting loan growth in the back half to be about half of what you saw in the first half a little more than that but not by much and it makes sense it would slow can you talk about what weve seen from an ltv perspective in the sbl book and whether or not some of that slowing loan growth is going to reflect some maybe some sbl paydown or is there the potential of some sbl reduction just because ltvs are getting high and so theres going to need to be some of that just mechanically and maybe also how you manage those ltvs in these choppy market environments multiparter sorry sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah so the ltvs are very wellmanaged no its okay its okay ill just try to remember it all so from the ltv perspective as you would expect were very much actually in line with where weve been from historical years and the reason for that is it is a very wellmanaged book and why any uptick at all as you would expect obviously the value of the underlying has gone down but from a historical basis weve always been within that weve sort of given a range a low range were in that range and were very much like i said in line over the last couple of years now as it relates directly to what were looking forward and seeing i think whats important here is that from a mortgage perspective you might see some slowing just obviously given where rates are now why would the morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 sbls come down you just might not have as much interest or engagement in the products with lower asset values so i dont look at it in terms of oh theres a management issue rather that is a very wellmanaged portfolio where we havent seen issues in a lot of different market environments with the calls from an operational perspective more broadly et cetera but rather just the engagement from that relationship side is this the right product to be using now you might not have those conversations as much with the asset values coming down so very practical answer to the question that you give operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi just a followup on the loan growth the billion loan growth chart at the start of the year it looks like youre still looking at that but how are you thinking about loss rates on those new loans given perhaps a new economic forecast we note that provisions for wealth losses are already triple the level of last year kind of whats the risk in that portfolio and does it make sense to have a loan growth target its always easy to make loans its just tough to get paid back sometimes thanks sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah i think that the loan growth target is i mean just in terms of its more of an expectation to help people understand where the nii trajectory is i wouldnt call it a target to the point that was raised by brennan obviously the expectations on a quarteroverquarter basis have come down so we did see some pull forward and thats all what were reflecting in that as you look at the provisions themselves theyre still very on a relative basis to other provisions across various those institutions and even our institutional securities franchise is quite low in terms of what drives that as you know it is based on the cecl concept and the life of loan concept and you also know it is a complicated idea between both qualitative and a quantitative scenario for us as we disclosed in our q the factors that we look at that are most important is really around gdp we did see a degradation in the gdp expectation so very consistent with whats gone on in the macroeconomic outlook and we are expecting the recession that weve talked about the probabilities are in the range and thats very consistent with also what weve said publicly mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and so did you have any extra cecl provisions this quarter sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley no we feel appropriately reserved for where we are right now operator thank you well take our next question from gerard cassidy with rbc capital markets gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 thank you good morning sharon in the workplace channel you guys had some good growth in the number of participants on a yearoveryear basis it was up the unvested asset values declined about can you give us a little color was it primarily just market conditions bringing that down or is there something else there sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley its a great question and you draw a good point distinction no those are just the value its just the value of the assets themselves have gone down that those holders have now the increase in participants has a lot to do with the fact that we just continue as we continue to win mandates weve seen that increase the number of participants what i would say in terms of just an opportunity in terms of engaging with those clients is obviously it is a difficult time and environment for some of those individuals and we continue to educate and use financial loan as a tool especially in these environments to explain the advicedriven model and provide us with an opportunity actually in this kind of environment to discuss what financial advice and what financial wellness is specifically as people see different declines in their potential portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and do the assets skew to more new startup companies that might be techorientated versus a more traditional industrial company or a staple company in those plans sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley there is a good portion i would say of technology companies that would be in that sector that you can see as you see those asset values decline but there is a balance on the other side of different types of companies and as we win mandates its not just on the tech side were winning mandates across different institutions especially as people better understand that financial wellness offering operator thank you well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning appreciate all the details on slide here the allowance for credit losses maybe youve had it before but its more relevant now and good detail if you had to kind of guesstimate in a moderate recession that billion of total acl where does that go sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i think that is a very difficult question to answer i think that what you can look at and think about it is obviously the economic scenario makes sense the gdp makes sense the size of where the growth actually comes from and goes and then there is some extension of duration that you can see dependent on the rate rise expectation matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay any way to frame is it double or triple obviously a lot of the loans are in wealth management which is just not going to you would think have as much loss content but any way to frame numerically how high it could go morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley yeah sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley i mean you know what i would do i would say is why dont you think about it as it relates to covid right you can think about where we were from a covid perspective and so lets talk isg specifically the provisions this quarter are million it was almost four times that when you think about where we were from a covid perspective matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley i would just point out that sorry id just point out that the wealth management piece acl percentage is these are very different kinds of loans from traditional consumer banking loans so youre just not going to see at least for that part of it a major major move for the others i think its just you cant project i mean who knows what kind of recession the recession might be how long it might be and so on but we manage this business conservatively and we dont have a big traditional middle market small business loan book we just dont have that kind of business matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc thats helpful and then just a clarification question the total dcp for the firm you mentioned million revenue impact in wealth but whats the firmwide revenue and expense impact please sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley its not material per business line which is why we dont call out the number james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley the reason we called it out in wealth just to be clear was wealth actually had a great quarter all right revenue growth new money growth feebased growth and margins yearoveryear the same at in a very difficult environment so we thought it was kind of raining on the party a little bit that the dcp took million off the top line number even though it comes out of the comp expense number almost dollarfordollar not quite so thats why we called it out ordinarily we wouldnt call out dcp we dont make a big deal of it its an accounting issue its not a business issue so were not often that excited about it but we just thought given youd all be interested in how the retail investor was behaving right now and what was going on in that business and how panicked they were the short answer is not very behaving well business stable saw growth hence we wanted to call it out morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 operator thank you well take our next question from jim mitchell with seaport global jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just on the rwa decline was that a deliberate reduction or is that more market driven and if ph somewhat some deliberate actions can you kind of give us a little more clarity on what those actions were specifically and if that can continue sharon yeshaya a chief financial officer morgan stanley yeah it was both is the way i would answer it there are obviously market declines that had to do with it as well but this was a very thoughtful approach around efficient uses of rwas and where does it make sense from business perspective given the uncertainty and i think there is a very as i said the same way when we think about the expenses its about being efficient and thoughtful and very prudent and flexible with all of that environment so its both of those things that were taken into account when thinking about the rwa decline james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley listen i want to make an important point here we regard our capital ratios as sacrosanct these are a big deal for us weve spent a decade building them we like having excess capital for exactly this environment were in now we can buy back up to billion and a bunch of it were going to be doing hopefully in the low so making sure we give ourselves that flexibility demonstrating discipline in a tough environment i think ted and the isg team did a phenomenal job in driving that number down and obviously its driven in part by volatility in the market so things outside of their control but this is something that we should and will try and control as best as we can jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc all right maybe as a followup on that james i think youve talked about hoping the change in the mix of your business over time would push your dfast losses and scb down slightly this year is probably a ph peer victory relative to what ph some happened to your peers but do you think theres still room to see that come down over time given your changing mix james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley absolutely look the ppnr number was materially up as ph stress losses were also up not surprisingly the test was incredibly demanding in this environment but notwithstanding that we increased the dividend and we still came out at ph i think versus were very focused on the scb buffer not getting away from us the change in business model the growth in the asset management business the growth in the workplace retirement business all of these things which frankly are very capital friendly yeah that number is going to keep moving then we have an argument weve been or not argument i wont put it that way but lets just say a different point of view with the federal reserve about how they treat financial advisor compensation during a time of stress and we have argued for a long time that financial advisor compensation is obviously variable so that morgan stanley ms corrected transcript q2 earnings call 14jul2022 expense comes down when revenues come down the fed has not yet seen it our way but were continuing to push that argument strongly and when it does we believe that will free up another bunch of capital operator thank you well take our next question from mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey james youve talked about variable expenses for variable revenues and the revenues were down and comp was down but at what point do you pull the lever on kind of plan b i mean you said on a recession and sharon talked about maybe delaying some projects but when it comes to resource allocation head count more aggressive moves to prepare for a difficult environment you said yourself that its uncertain its not the time to take too much extra risk push for market share but is it time to go to plan b a more recessionlike scenario in terms of your resource management james patrick gorman a chairman chief executive officer morgan stanley no its not were overwhelmingly in the us we had revenue growth in the wealth management business produced exintegration margins this is a business we definitely dont want to harm in this environment and we are managing i mean i guess its quasiplan b managing the rwas as we just said and the balance sheet reflecting a more stressed environment we met as a management committee last september i think and i spoke to the management committee about i felt there was much more downside risk to the market the magnitude of it i didnt have a strong feeling for but i thought it was somewhere between significant and a really significant and i think were in the sort of significant phase of it right now so we started pulling back mike at that point weve got a very clear handle on head count growth on where that growth is weve also got lot of regulatory obligations weve got to continue to fulfill as all the banks do but right now were definitely not in a sort of crisis mode at all i mean if we were we wouldnt be buying back billion increasing the dividend on the other hand balance sheet growth will be very measured i think well pick up share by banks coming back to us not necessarily us having to move forward and as i think sharon articulated very well were doing a pretty systematic review of the prioritization of all the projects going on around the firm listen in a big company like this with billion of revenue we have a lot of stuff going on and we have choices as to when we do it so id call it a sort of plan a minus not a plan b if you will but thats the mindset were in however if things get worse and in my career ive seen a lot of recessions a lot of crises a lot of damage done to the environment if things really deteriorated particularly in the us then wed take a much more aggressive position and we obviously have the ultimate weapon which is comp operator thank you there are no further questions at this time ladies and gentlemen this concludes todays conference call thank you for participating you may now
