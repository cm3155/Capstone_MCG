experiences our broad range of flexible financing solutions and compelling value propositions continue to resonate with customers as they engage across our diversified portfolio we added million new accounts and generated billion of purchase volume both new account and purchase volume growth continue to be impacted by a modest pullback in consumer spending as well as the credit actions that synchrony has taken since the middle of to reinforce the credit trajectory of our portfolio in and beyond despite those actions average active accounts remained stable versus last year and ending receivables grew purchase volume and receivables at the platform level reflected a continuation of the trends weve discussed synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 over the course of this year customers continue to be selective in how and where they spend particularly as they manage their spend to navigate the effects of inflation on needs like groceries utilities and rent platform purchase volume growth ranged between down and down yearoveryear generally reflecting lower spend per account as customers moderated both bigger ticket and discretionary spend particularly in categories like furniture electronics cosmetic and vision as well as the impact of synchronys credit actions receivables growth across the platforms ranged from to higher versus last year primarily driven by payment rate moderation dual and cobranded cards accounted for of total purchase volume for the quarter and decreased generally due to more selective consumer spend behavior and the impact of our credit actions the trends we see in the outofpartner spend on these products have generally remained consistent with those at the platform level our customers continue to be discerning in their discretionary purchases particularly around larger ticket categories such as home furnishing travel and entertainment and our prioritizing non discretionary spend like groceries and pharmacy as we would generally expect our customers across credit grades are spending less per transaction in most categories with average transaction values declining versus last year more specifically our nonprime customers reduced their average transaction values by about versus last year while prime transaction values moderated by our super prime customers continue to drive more outofpartner spend with transaction value declines of around yearoveryear that said customers across credit grades are transacting with relatively stable frequency compared to last year which has partially offset the impact of lower transaction values from a payment behavior perspective we continue to see relative stability in our nonprime segment meanwhile our prime and super prime customers have continued to gradually shift from above minimum payment to minimum payment the proportion of less than minimum payments in our portfolio remains below the to average across all credit segments when taken together we believe the spend and payment trends were observing across our portfolio reflect a consumer that is making healthy decisions that align with their respective priorities and

with that ill turn the call over to brian to discuss our financial performance in greater detail brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone synchrony delivered another quarter of strong financial results demonstrating the resilience of our differentiated business model and our ability to execute across our key strategic priorities to deliver consistently compelling outcome for our stakeholders ending loan receivables reached billion in the third quarter reflecting growth of compared to last year as the benefit of approximately basis point decrease in payment rate more than offset the decline in purchase volume net revenue grew to billion due to combined impact of higher interest and fees lower rsa and higher other income net interest income increased to billion as interest and fees grew primarily reflecting growth in average loan receivables and a higher loan receivable yield our loan receivable yield grew basis points due to the combined impact of our product pricing and policy changes or pppcs and lower payment rate partially offset by higher reversals total interestbearing liabilities cost was basis points yearoveryear due to higher benchmark rates rsas of million were of average loan receivables in the third quarter and declined million versus the prior year primarily driven by higher net chargeoffs and other income increased to million primarily related to the impact of our pppcrelated fees which were partially offset by the impact of our pets best disposition and venture investment gains and losses provision for credit losses increased to billion reflecting higher net chargeoffs and a million reserve bill other expenses grew to billion which was driven by cost relating to the ally lending acquisition technology investment and preparatory expenses related to the late fee rule change partially offset by lower operational losses the preparatory expenses related to late fee rule change reflected million of incremental costs related to both the execution of our pppcs and the implementation costs of the rule itself should it become effective even with these incremental costs the efficiency ratio was for the third quarter an improvement of approximately basis points versus last year reflecting synchronys continued cost discipline and commitment to driving operational leverage in our business taken together synchrony generated net earnings of million or per diluted share this produced a return on average assets of and a return on tangible common equity of synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 next ill cover our key credit trends on slide at quarterend our 30plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year and basis points above our historical average from the third quarters of to our 90plus delinquency rate was versus in the prior year and basis points above our historical average from the third quarters of to and our net charge off rate was in the third quarter versus in the prior year and basis points above our historical average from the third quarters of to our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was which was generally consistent with the second quarter coverage ratio of as shown on slide the credit actions weve taken from mid2023 to early are improving our delinquency trajectory as the rate of yearoveryear growth in both 30plus and 90plus delinquency rates continue to decelerate well continue to closely monitor our portfolio performance as well as credit trends for the broader industry given our share of consumer and well take additional credit actions if necessary while the actions we have taken since last year have reduced new account and purchase volume growth in the short term we expect they will strengthen our portfolios position as we exit and support our ability to deliver our targeted risk adjusted returns over the long term turning to slide synchronys funding capital and liquidity continued to provide a strong foundation for our business during the third quarter synchrony grew our direct deposits by approximately million reduced our broker deposits by billion and issued million of senior unsecured fixedtofloating rate notes due in at quarterend deposits represented of our total funding while secured and unsecured debt each representing of our total funding respectively total liquid assets and undrawn credit facilities were billion a billion increase versus last year and represented of total assets a 60basispoint increase from last year focusing on our capital ratios as a reminder we elected to take the benefit of the cecl transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies synchrony will make a final transition adjustment to our regulatory capital metrics of approximately basis points in january the impact of cecl has already been recognized in our income statement and balance sheet under the cecl transition rules we ended the third quarter with a cet1 ratio of basis points higher than last years our tier capital ratio was basis points above last year our total capital ratio increased basis points to and our tier capital plus reserves ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year synchrony returned million to shareholders during the third quarter which consisted of million in share repurchases and million in common stock dividends as of quarterend we had million remaining in our share repurchase authorization for the period ending june synchrony remains well positioned to return capital to shareholders as guided by our business performance market conditions regulatory restrictions and subject to our capital plan turning to our outlook synchrony remains focused on executing our key strategic priorities and taking the appropriate actions to reinforce our business performance for years to come particularly our ability to deliver our longterm financial target on average over time we have been closely monitoring our portfolio and believe that both our credit actions and the pppcs are performing in line with our expectations with the first quarter of our pppcs in effect we are experiencing slightly lower paper statement fee income than expected with stronger enrollment in ebill were also experiencing less customer attrition than expected which is a testament to the value propositions of the products we offer we will continue to track the financial and operational impact on our customers partners and portfolios to determine synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 alongside our partners whether any refinements to our strategies are warranted to achieve our shared objectives of sustainable riskadjusted growth at our targeted longterm returns as a reminder specifically related to the framework around the pending late fee rule change and our pppcs there continues to be uncertainty regarding the timing and outcome of late feerelated litigation that was filed in march the potential changes in consumer behavior that could occur as a result of late fee rule change and any potential changes in consumer behavior in response to the pppcs we and the broader industry have implemented as a result of the new rule outcomes and actual performance related to any of these uncertainties could impact our outlook with that framework lets turn to our outlook for the remainder of we expect the consumer to continue to manage their spending which when combined with our credit actions should result in lowsingledigit decline in purchase volume for the fourth quarter we continue to expect payment rates to moderate which when combined with the purchase volume expectations should contribute to lowsingledigit growth in ending loan receivables compared to last year given that the late fee rule was not implemented on october as assumed in our previous outlook and the continued uncertainty with regard to late fee litigation we assume the late fee rule will not become effective in as a result we expect net interest income to remain sequentially flat as the impacts of our pppcs are offset by seasonally higher reversals other income is expected to remain consistent with the third quarter level rsa will continue to align program and company performance and should decrease sequentially on a dollar basis and as a percentage of average loan receivables reflecting the net impact of seasonally higher net chargeoffs on flat revenue other expense is expected to increase sequentially with the seasonally higher growth and from a credit perspective we expect delinquencies to follow seasonality in the fourth quarter we also continue to expect the second half net chargeoff rate will be lower than the first half lastly we continue to expect our yearend reserve rate to be generally in line with the yearend rate given these assumptions synchrony expects to deliver fully diluted earnings per share between and for the full year the approximate improvement from the midpoint of our prior fullyear eps outlook reflects a combination of factors first the removal of our assumption that the late fee rule well be implementing on october and therefore also the removal of the related benefit from the rsa offset second the impact of our pppcs and the increase in rsa associated with those changes and finally strong performance of our core business as we enter the fourth quarter in summary synchrony has continued to deliver on key strategic priorities that matter most to our stakeholders we remain confident in the measures weve taken thus far to strengthen our business in an evolving environment and believe were well positioned to drive resilient riskadjusted returns over the long term with that ill now turn the call back over to brian for his closing thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks brian synchrony is leveraging our proprietary data and analytics our deep lending expertise and our innovative digital capabilities to provide seamless customer experiences compelling value propositions and enhanced utility with each customer interaction we have we are increasingly anywhere our customers want to be met with financial solutions that drive loyalty and sales for our

turn the call back to kathryn to open the qa synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 kathryn harmon miller senior vice president directorinvestor relations synchrony financial that concludes our prepared remarks we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one followup question if you have additional questions investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator operator instructions we will take our first question from ryan nash with goldman sachs please go ahead ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning everyone brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial hey ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc brian maybe you could unpack the nii guy for us a little bit i understand is seasonally lower from reversals as you highlighted but how did the pppcs fit in along with your liabilitysensitive position which i dont think you highlighted in your comments and then i guess just given forward curve expectations outside of seasonality do you expect the nim to have a continued upward bias over the next several quarters thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks ryan so when you think about nii sequentially as you step into the fourth quarter the first when you think about the trends that are into delinquency and the units falling into delinquency dollars assessed on late fees should be down in versus you combine that with higher reversals that is essentially offsetting the positivity you should see and you will see on interest income and the benefit that we see in interest expense so it kind of washes out in the quarter more just a function of how the favorability from delinquency is impacting late fees as you start to think out again net interest margin for a second you should continue to see the interest component relative to the pppcs as well as the raw rate as payment rates decline increase in guide the nim higher and you should also see a benefit of interest expense that will lag a little bit because of the reset of the debt stack particularly in the cds that happens over the first half of the year so theres generally more tailwinds synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 as you think about margin as you move into next year but its going to be a little bit lagged given the reset of cds in the first half of the year both of which happened in the second quarter ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and then as my followup question your outlook for credit calls for delinquencies to follow seasonality i guess first you expect losses to do the same and then in terms of delinquencies following seasonality like what does that mean for the trajectory of losses into and if they do follow seasonality can losses move back below into next year thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah so ryan well be back in january to talk really really about next year but i think heres a couple things i would think about credit as a whole first theres probably four points that id raise number one the delinquency trends themselves were seeing strong entry rate which is better than the prepandemic period which is continuing to benefit the flow into delinquency were seeing early stage delinquency really being stable as far as its performance month on month and then were seeing some improvement in the last several months in late stage collections which are positive so i think delinquency trends are doing fairly well when you think about that relative to seasonality last several months weve actually been low to midsingle digits better than seasonality when you look at to period so thats a favorable trend that continues to go back continue to go back the last several months again i think ive highlighted publicly the vintage performance both of the second half of the first half of albeit very early its trending better than the vintages and again i think you can see both in the purchase volume and the new account origination most certainly the credit actions are having some effect there which i think bolsters credit as we move back through our underwriting is designed to give us that to so the intention would be that we would get back to that point again were moving down you can see in the slides that the yearoveryear growth in delinquencies both 30plus and 90plus continue to decline so again tracking to our expectations as we move through the remainder part of ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from terry ma with barclays please go ahead terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc hey thank you good morning so you called out a basis point yearoveryear increase in loan yields from pppcs lower payment rates and offset by interest reversals any way you can kind of quantify each of those components and maybe just help us think about how that pppc component kind of grows into next year synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah you know terry were not going to break out the individual components of the pppcs by line items but most certainly the benefit is flowing through on the interest yield line number one it is mapped a little bit when you think sequentially given the gain in the second quarter on the visa shares but clearly its showing up in other income again this is the first full quarter that we have the first phase of the cits in we continue to expect that to build into next year i think when we come back in january well try to provide a little bit more view on that i think when you take a step back terry the important thing and i highlighted it in my prepared remarks is the actions weve taken have generally been in line with our expectations theres a positivity in the fact that customer attrition is not as been high as our expectations now again that would have had a reserve release of negative from a financial perspective but its really better from a customer standpoint as they recognize the value propositions of our cards we did highlight paper statements were a little bit lower than expectations partially due to softeners partially due to our accounts being a little bit lower than expectations but all in all good adoption of ebill and our customers willingness to change behavior and do that has been positive so when we look at that generally speaking it aligns so even though theres a little bit less customer attrition that generally means the core is performing a little bit better so as we sit here today we are feeling good about where we are but well continue to watch customer behavior and well certainly watch the market a lot of issuers have already started to implement changes as this rule comes effective terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc got it thats helpful and then just to follow up on credit it seems credit performance is more or less performing in line with your expectations but as i look at the chargeoff rate for this year its running somewhat north of i dont want to tie it to your initial guide but maybe just talk about how credit performance has evolved relative to kind of what you expected coming into this year brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the way i think about it terry is we took some actions really in the late first quarter early second quarter again to try to set up and protect ourselves against any deterioration that could happen late this year or into next year so we took those actions well certainly i think youve seen some of the purchase volume which is slightly lower than our expectations that unfortunately has an impact on the denominator which brings the rate a little bit higher than what you think about but again i think the fact that were not taking broadbased actions today gives us some credit some confidence in credit and well certainly youve heard my points with ryan a little bit earlier around the four things that we looked at to say hey listen we feel good about where we are as we enter into the fourth quarter terry ma q analyst barclays capital inc great thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks terry have a good day synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 operator thank you well take our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning brian you mentioned some improvement over the last few months in latestage collections i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about that if thats just kind of mix catch up and generally speaking is it harder to execute on collections today versus prior brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes thank you good morning don let me start with the latter part of your question is it harder to collect today most certainly i think if you look at this versus a number of years ago most certainly making customer contacts is a little bit tougher but thats where weve expanded and through the pandemic investing in digital collections investing in other forms and to other channels which we can connect with the customer in order to kind of get those collections done such as tax and things like that so it is a little bit tougher i think its a game where you have to deploy more products than you do have to do just get more collectors on the phone and most certainly the rules have evolved where the number of collections you can make to someone have declined but i think weve adapted to that i think when you think about the late stage for a second when your early stage has deteriorated quite a bit what flows into the back potentially has the ability to be slightly better and able to collect so while i look at the late stage it is still performing worse than in the prepandemic period it has started to improve more recently which we take as optimistic with regard to performance but again it is worse than what it was and you would expect a little bit of that if you have very positive entry rate into delinquency what flows in is a little bit tougher to collect so we would have anticipated both early stage and late stage to be worse but right now in the last i would say several months we have seen a little bit of improvement in that late stage collections donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it my followup just i know there is a lot of concern around the low end it seems like your customers in the low end are kind of managing changing behavior continuing to change behavior but it doesnt seem like its sort of accelerating in terms of a pressure point is that fair brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i think it is absolutely fair i mean we look at it in a couple of different ways when you look at payment rate people making payments when we look at the trends by credit grade which if you say that somewhat aligns with income decile youre seeing more the movement in the prime so that ph to range youre seeing a little bit more movement there into min pay you are not really seeing as much movement of the nonprime in there i want to say the movement into min pay is about a point difference on the prime and it was half of that in the nonprime so were not seeing stress when it comes to payment i think when you look at the kshaped recovery clearly affordability has impacted some of the lowerend consumer and theyve pulled back spending and theyre managing fairly well so i think when we look at those two combined we dont see stress in the consumer we see them actually doing somewhat rational things right synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 now so its more normalization but again when you still look back against the prime customers they are paying their rates still above the level so we dont necessarily see signs of stress in the lowend today donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from moshe orenbuch with td cowen please go ahead moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc great so brian i was wondering if you could talk a little bit about the slowdown in spending volume and sort of separated between the impacts of kind of your own tightening consumer preferences and then perhaps also the policy changes one of the questions weve gotten is do you think i know you said that attrition wasnt affected by that but what about spending volume so those three factors thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks yeah first of all good morning moshe thanks for the question so let me start where you ended when you look at the actions which we took in the portfolio with regards to pricing changes and the like the positive news is were able to have a control group in which we tested against that so when we look at volume changes between the people who received cits and those who didnt receive the cits theres not a material difference so we somewhat have a base to say that the actions having here created solid attrition that were not aware of so thats one i think the latter part of your question i think when you look at the purchase volume in and of itself what you see is most certainly across the board almost transaction values coming down so the consumer is trading down a bit we see that and i used the examples mattresses where the frequency maybe hasnt moved down as much but the average transaction values moved down as consumers say listen im willing to purchase a mattress but then again im not willing to spend im going to go down to something at and weve seen that across the board in retailers and i think you see it generally speaking across the board i mean in discretionary items even in our health and wellness business you see it in cosmetics in lasik things that can be deferred now thats a shortterm impact most certainly that will create a tailwind at some point as both those types of procedures dont go away and youre right some of the actions we took we had a modest impact on purchase volume a more meaningful impact on new accounts in order to make sure that the origination of the books are at riskadjusted returns that are attractive to us moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc maybe to kind of at a high level for either brian as you think about the underlying economic environment weve been in a period where wage growth has exceeded inflation although the consumer still feels kind of pressured synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 and is still in that process as you pointed out of trading down when you think about the sort of things that you are looking for to try and jumpstart or reverse some of those tightenings what are the things that youd be looking for kind of from a macro standpoint maybe talk a little bit about that thank you brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah moshe maybe ill start on this one look i think to brians point the consumer is still in pretty good shape the trends that were seeing are pretty similar across the industry inflation is having an impact but i think to your point the strong labor market is definitely helping to offset some of that pressure i think consumers are slowing spend but theyre doing it in a very kind of rational disciplined way we actually like the fact that we can see that theyre managing to a budget theyre navigating the higher cost of goods this isnt a new trend we started to see it earlier this year youre seeing it a little bit more broad based right now but not in a concerning way i think from a credit perspective this is exactly what we wanted to see some of that is pulled back on behalf of the consumer and some of that is just the actions that we took but again i think similar to credit youre just seeing spend kind of move back to a normalized level i think when credit levels off and you start to see some stability theres still a lot of uncertainty out there and i think when those clouds start to clear then you start to get back to what we would consider more normal growth in the business driving new accounts back to levels that would be similar to prior to this year moshe orenbuch q analyst td securities usa llc thanks very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks moshe have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw please go ahead sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning maybe just to close the loop on credit brian wenzel maybe you could talk about the reserve rate trend line maybe how we should think about the direction into next year i know youre not giving guidance for next year i know youll be giving guidance by yearend but like just to think about when we migrate back to some normalized levels of reserve rate brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thank you and good morning sanjay i think the guidance wed kind of give you is that the reserve rate at the end of this year will generally be in line with the reserve rate at the end of last year which was or i know people are probably focusing on the term generally obviously when you look at the yearend number and thats a big seasonal factor its just really how the receivable develops and how it plays out i think most certainly ive given you some of the delinquency trends that builds into the quantitative model and again i think weve seen while its been a little bit choppy the macroeconomic environment being a little bit more stable were pleased that the federal reserve did lower rates so again i think as we exit out of this year generally in synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 line with last year i think you kind of have some indication how you think about the loss trajectory and most certainly i dont think we see anything today that says to us were not going to continue to march back towards that day one cecl and most certainly as you see the delinquency levels which are slightly above where we were in the pre pandemic period where when you compare it back both 30plus and 90plus as that moves back towards normal we would expect the reserve rate to continue to ph slow down absent mix shifts sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great and maybe just on the cfpb late fee rules i guess brian wenzel you talked a lot about sort of the behavior of the consumer but has anything changed in terms of when you expect to fully mitigate the impact to the extent it goes in sometime next year then maybe if it doesnt happen like how should we think about the game plan if it doesnt go into effect do you claw back some of the changes that youve made or do other things im just trying to think through the implications there thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah let me start in and then see if brian has any additional comments to your first part of your question sanjay it doesnt really impact the point of neutrality right it really goes from the starting point to the neutrality point whats the trough level depending upon when the late fee rule kind of comes into play so i dont think its necessarily one where we look back and say the early performance weve seen changes that exit rate of neutrality based upon our analysis so i think that piece of it remains in place with regard to when the rule may become effective well probably do that sometime either in the fourth quarter or january if we have more information when we have a better assumption with regard to when that rule does go in play we are operating as a company and most certainly the administration has taken the view that they want the late fee rule in and were planning as if its going to go in its just the point of entry of when it goes in so your question really around is there a clawback people use the term rollback as a company we havent spent any real time thinking about that again we view its going to come into effect in some way and if it doesnt then we have to have a high degree of certainty that it wouldnt go back into play and then its really a conversation for those that share the economic impact of this and then for our properties wed have to do that assessment but again we havent spent a lot of time in this we believe the rule will go in effect and were planning as a company to execute that i dont know brian if you have any further comments you want to brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah no i think look we had the plan as if there was going to be an late fee because it takes time for these offsets to bleed in we work with our partners on that its hard to speculate on whether actually goes into effect or they remove the safe harbor there is a lot of different ways that this could play out but were prepared for all of those events and in terms of rolling anything back i think like brian said thats a discussion that we have with our partners just like when we rolled out the initial pricing actions and we operate very transparently with them and we did when we rolled out the pricing changes and well do that depending on the eventual outcome of the late fee again our goal hasnt changed here were trying to protect our partners and continue to approve the same customers that we do today synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great sanjay have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america please go ahead mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi thank you for taking my question maybe to start i just wanted to turn to net interest margins for a little bit how do you expect them to perform in a declining rate environment i ask because your portfolio is a little different than some of your large peers with a little bit more fixed rate in it so just maybe if you can walk through the moving pieces there and also any deposit beta assumptions youd be willing to share brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning mihir and thanks for your question so i think when you think about our framework for net interest margin im going to put aside a little bit of the alr mix and ill come back to that at the end i think when you first think about the interest in fee component yield piece of this you should be getting a little bit of a benefit as the impact of prime rate movements for that portion of the business to flow through right because prime lags the way which we bill it so hopefully we get a benefit on the floating rate component of it most certainly as payment rate continues to come down the revolve rate component should rise so those two should create tailwinds inside the interest and fee side of the nim component i think when you think about the funding side from both the investment portfolio as well as the interest expense obviously were going to have to follow market traditionally weve lagged the market a little bit from a digital banking perspective i think what youve seen here in the third quarter is that digital banks have been a little bit more proactive at lowering rates earlier than normal given their probably funding needs so we followed them down so i think that creates an additional tailwind when you think about that for a second you have to break it out between the high yield savings component which has a more immediate impact but again its probably of our retail deposits and then you get to of cds a bulk of which will reprice in the first half and will certainly more than i want to say reprice entirely during next year but a bulk of it really reprice in the first half of the year a lot of which is in the second quarter given the way in which we originated certificates this year so again that lags a little bit on some of the earlier fed movements but should be able to capture that rate movement down as we move back in and the last thing i bring in is alr is a little bit of a wildcard when it comes to nim i look at it today if were paying someone on a high yield savings getting from the fed its a positive economic position for the company so im not necessarily sure i want to take liquidity down at that point because were going to need it as we begin to exit and grow here from this period of time so again if that turns more negative or flat then well synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 rethink how much liquidity we carry so those are the moving pieces i think here to kind of give you some sense on how you should think about nim mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay no thats very helpful thank you and then maybe switching back to purchase volumes just following up on i think moshes questions just wanted to make sure i understand what gives you confidence that purchase volume declines i guess or purchase volumes are stabilized here at this down low singledigit level and relatedly are there certain platforms which you look at which are leading indicators of where purchase volumes are going or consumer financial health thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah obviously we look at the trends daily and we watch daily sales and see where they flow and watch the what i would call a counteradjusted yearoveryear view and a kind of daily yearoveryear view so i think we try to gain insight to see whether or not we see trends and i think we see stability where we are brian mentioned earlier again we started to see a decline really in the second quarter and accelerated into the third quarter but now its somewhat stabilized again holiday is always an interesting period of time how promotional it will be and which retailers win or lose there so thats a little bit of a wild card but i think generally speaking when we look at the spending behavior patterns broadly speaking in the aggregate we dont see things that are continuing to slow i think when we further break that down by what i would call the credit grade pieces of it its been fairly consistent where your higher credit grades continue to be higher than your lower credit grades with regard to what theyre consuming so i think we look at that and say okay there is some stability heading into the holiday season i think to your point is there a platform that indiscernible i think you have to look at and say is there platforms that are much more discretionary or there are ones that arent right so i think youre going to see ones that have more discretionary spend may be a little bit more down than others you still see strength in certain parts of the portfolio inside of the platform so example vets performing better than other pieces inside health wellness so that should continue brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i think the other thing is if you just go back and think about the two years prior to this were coming off of record levels of consumer spend not just in our business but across the industry and i think we all knew at some point inflation was going to catch up to the consumer particularly at the lower income levels and were starting to see that so a slowdown is not necessarily a bad thing in this environment mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc all right thank you for taking my questions brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks mihir have a good day synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 operator thank you well take our next question from mark devries with deutsche bank please go ahead mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah thanks you mentioned earlier that you started to see others implement changes just interested in your thoughts on kind of what youve learned from that whether youve decided you need to recalibrate to remain competitive it doesnt really sound like it just given the low attritions or alternatively whether you kind of missed an opportunity to change terms with some borrowers that you viewed as more marginal brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thank you good morning so again we maintain a competitive screen of those people who are in the partnershipbased business you dont necessarily look at broadbased generalpurpose cards who have a different competitive dynamic relative to their value propositions but when we look at people who have implemented changes in the partnership side from a competitive standpoint they generally have done similar types of things relative to aprs some have done things with paper statements so i think we look at that landscape and i think we feel comfortable with the actions that weve taken and again we look more so to how our portfolio performs our relationships with our merchants and the value proposition we have with our customers clearly the pricing of a credit product has to resonate with the value proposition that they get if those two are out of equilibrium youre going to have a situation where the consumer is not going to want your product so its more were focused on ourselves i think when we look at the competitive screen i think we think about it as being in line with and were not necessarily an outlier relative to our peers mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thanks and then on the guidance for reserve coverage at the end of the year it implies a bigger kind of step down seasonally than we saw the last couple of years could you just talk about whats driving that brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial most certainly i think when you think about the reserve coverage rate its generally a forwardlooking view on how you think losses will be over a reasonable period of time number one and two are there other things that arent in your quantitative model that you need to account for macroeconomic being one i think as we think about the end of the year and think about the lost content through the delinquency we see today and how we feel about the macro i think we feel comfortably its only going to be in line with what we had the end of last year mark devries q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 operator thank you well take our next question from john hecht with jefferies please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc yeah good morning guys thanks very much for taking my questions most have been asked and answered im wondering the health wellness segment always been a good contributor to growth and im just wondering are you seeing similar kind of spend trends from a discretionary nondiscretionary perspective in that category is there anything else to call out there that might be different from kind of the rest of the portfolio brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial yeah john let me start on this and then hand it to brian i think look the health wellness segment has been a big area of focus for us over the last couple of years we think weve got the right to win in that space its a huge market billion roughly weve seen a little bit of a pullback recently but if you look over a little bit longer period of time weve definitely been able to accelerate the growth there we think weve got a great value proposition weve got a wellrecognized brand actually we get the best customer nps and customer satisfaction scores with those products so we feel great about how were positioned in health wellness not surprisingly where youve seen some pullback more broadly across the business has been in bigger ticket discretionary purchases and youre seeing some of that in the carecredit space again nothing concerning from our perspective youre still seeing largely better growth there than you are and the rest of the business is based on the investments that weve made to date brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah just maybe to add a little bit more color i think when you look inside the health wellness sales platform and think about the diversity again i highlighted pet pet is up yearoveryear so there are pieces of that portfolio that are doing well cosmetics down etcetera you see some things and we talked about the consumer being discretionary some of your high ticket dental which is more of a deferrable expense for some thats down so i think you look at that the positive news we take out of that platform again the reason the card is up to which is up basis points versus last year so again brian highlighted the net promoter score in the likability of this product the value proposition and the brand of this product resonates with those consumers so again we continue to see the use and most certainly its an area where i think when people start to lean back into some of the more discretionary type procedures that are nonmedical that will begin to see that lift and again having loan growth yearoveryear is still a very strong part of the portfolio and part of our company strategy john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay great thanks and then i know you guys are preparing for a variety of outcomes with the late fee backdrop im wondering can you give us just sort of an update on where it stands on litigation is there anything on the docket or on the calendar that we should be looking to that might represent an event that could give us a little bit more color about whats going to happen there brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 yeah and john what id say is there was a hearing that was held at the end of august most certainly right now were waiting for the and the plaintiffs are waiting for the decision with regard to the motion thats in front of the court which is both about venue and the standing of one of the plaintiffs in the case theres not a timetable for that district court to respond to that motion so were awaiting for that you then go into whether or not one of the parties whoevers on the other side of that whether or not they would take action with the fifth circuit to appeal it or whether or not the next motion would be around the injunction itself or whether or not the injunction itself should be lifted from there so again i think were in a waiting game i think its fair to say that anyone whos tried to predict this has been wrong so were not in the prediction business today so we continue to operate the business as if the late fee rule will go in and well obviously await what the court says about the litigation but obviously we feel good that the merits of litigation there but really its inherently uncertain brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial i mean john if you think about it were prepared and our entire plan was enacted to offset what is the worst case which was by october obviously that has come and gone it is difficult to speculate on when this is actually going to become effective but if you think about it as all the pricing actions that we rolled out policy changes et cetera were done assuming an october implementation date and and so as we kind of buy time thats helpful from that perspective but again we didnt have the luxury of waiting we acted very quickly here and rolled out the pricing changes and theyre performing as expected john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great appreciate that guys thanks very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great john have a good day operator thank you well take our next question from jeff adelson with morgan stanley please go ahead jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions guys i just wanted to circle back on the loan growth outlook and some of the credit actions youve taken it sounds like if im hearing it right you maybe have slowed the intensity of these credit actions you took earlier in the year so just assuming you keep that stance in place today does that mean this slowing trend youre looking for exiting the year kind of at this lowsingledigit growth rate maybe can reverse itself into next year or what would it take for that to reaccelerate and how should we think eventually about the timeline to getting back to that highsingledigit kind of longterm growth rate you look for brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks jeff for the question and good morning the first thing i just want to clarify when we take action a lot of its strategy actions that arent necessarily a single point in time so for instance some of the actions we took around debt consolidation loans are student loans to some degree if that strategy trips today action happens so theyre ongoing theyre not new actions they are the same actions just whether ph an synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 account is applicable to that action so again the actions that we are taking today are more idiosyncratic based upon a partner channel or product performance relative to the riskadjusted return i think when you think about how credit actions play out and how the consumer plays out brian highlighted earlier most certainly were in a period of time thats a little bit more transitory right so you have affordability issues for some of the lowerend lowerincome consumers hopefully with interest rates coming down and inflation coming down that abates a bit and takes some of that pressure off remember a lot of the pressure on credit today stems not necessarily from economics of the consumer but more that the fact that too much credit has been put in the system in the to early year that has to work its way through the system i think as that begins to recede which i think youre seeing in certain issuers across the industry that gives us a little bit of a tailwind which says that we can begin to unwind some of the restricted credit actions that we took over the past two years potentially in the latter part of but again thats going to be based upon performance so i dont think this is a longterm trend on growth its probably a good thing in this period where the credit is a little bit more uncertain but obviously our longterm framework and our models are built to deliver to loan receivable growth jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc and as my followup i know youre not sizing the pppc drivers in the lines but could you maybe talk about how you feel youre tracking versus that initial million to million you were talking about earlier in the year and just maybe remind us of any of the pppc changes youre holding off on at this point until the late fee rule comes through or if it comes through rather brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah the way i think about it jeff its generally in line with as i talk about customer attrition being lower thats a swing between bau bucket and this bucket so again id sit back and say if you were to take a step back and go to ph feet i think youd say the pppc actions generally are in line with and indiscernible performing a little bit better but again the point i brought up earlier the point of neutrality as we look at the analysis hasnt changed for us its really just the trough so when does the rule come effective and our trajectory to there but the point hasnt pushed out i know we havent really talked about that because we want to be able to understand when that rule goes in place and as soon as it does we will certainly provide that neutrality point but again things are performing generally in line and of course performed a little bit better than our expectations which i think is reflected in the outlook on page jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thank you operator thank you and we are at our allotted time for questions we will have time for one more and well take our final question from rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question i was afraid jeff was going to run out the clock on me look i realize that cecl reserve is a thought exercise and i realize that guidance on your reserve rate is a thought exercise on synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 16oct2024 a thought exercise im curious though if we look at the third quarter reserve rate its basically at a cyclical high and youre guiding for the fourth quarter back to levels you basically have days of incremental information and it feels like youve gone from a very cautious outlook to a more or less cautious outlook whats changed or what mechanically is driving the sort of decline that mark devries had pointed out as well brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah good morning rick and im glad that we run the clock out on you got to answer ask your question simply put it really goes back to the denominator your loss content right now is big right i mean you can most certainly in your model rule what the fourth quarter loss number should look like and what the first quarter dollar losses should look like it really just becomes the denominator so i dont view as saying that were trying to be any more cautious or guide to something that says we fundamentally see a different credit trajectory more so its just more the mechanics of the calculation of taking your reserve over an endofperiod loan number richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you very much guys brian d doubles a president chief executive officer director synchrony financial thanks rick brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony
