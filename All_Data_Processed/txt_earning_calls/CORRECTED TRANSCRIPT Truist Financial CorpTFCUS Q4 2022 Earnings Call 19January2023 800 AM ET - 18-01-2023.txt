our commitment for positive operating leverage for the full year well cover the details on the quarters results throughout the presentation and well start with our purpose the foundation of our company on slide truist is a purposedriven company dedicated to inspiring and building better lives and communities our purpose is the foundation for our success as a company it drives performance and defines how we do business every day slide highlights many examples of how we activated our purpose in for our clients our mission is to provide distinctive secure and successful experiences through touch and technology we achieved a major milestone along that journey with the launch of truist one banking our differentiated product suite that reimagines everyday banking and includes two new accounts that eliminate overdraft fees and provide greater access to credit these accounts meaningfully advance financial inclusion in our communities and were very encouraged by the positive reception theyve received from new and existing clients alike based on august through december data which reflects truist one branch checking production increased from a year ago period and we achieved this result despite having around fewer branches the truist one suite now also includes our new cash reserve depositbased credit line up to which launched in mid december and expands our commitment to our clients and communities our ability to innovate at the intersection of touch and technology was greatly enhanced by the opening of our new innovation technology center which brings our crossfunctional teams together with clients and large tech companies to reimagine banking experiences for everyone weve already realized the benefits of the itc as truist one banking and the new digital and hybrid investment capabilities launched throughout the year were all cocreated with clients in our client journey rooms we also continued to deliver on our mission for our teammates in october we took a bold step to improve the lives of our teammates by raising our minimum wage to an hour in the three months since this took effect weve experienced improved teammate recruitment retention lower turnover expenses better execution and an allaround better client experience we also enhanced our total rewards program to include an employee stock purchase program to further align our teammates interest with those of our shareholders as a company that champions diversity equity and inclusion we achieved our goal to increase ethnically diverse representation in senior leadership roles a year early with aspirations for further progress truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 finally truist has made a significant impact on the communities we serve by meeting and in some categories exceeding our billion community benefits plan our first inspirational commitment as truist and one that has served as a framework for similar plans across the industry the execution of this plan was a testament to our purpose of building better lives and communities by elevating low and moderate income in minority communities through material support for affordable housing nonprofit small business and community development lending in summary were delivering on our purpose and the significance of what our teammates have accomplished is just outstanding well continue to raise the bar and i look forward to the year ahead as we actualize our purpose advance integrated relationship management positively impact clients and communities through continued investment in touch and technology and make truist an even better place to work now turning to slide selected items for the quarter totaled million pretax and included our final charges related to the moe now that our integration activities are complete moe costs will exit our run rate going forward this is a positive development for shareholders that underscores our pivot to execution and will simplify our narrative enhance our earnings quality and improve capital generation turning to our fourth quarter performance highlights on slide truist delivered strong fourth quarter earnings of billion or per share on a reported basis adjusted earnings totaled billion or per share up sequentially as strong ppnr growth was partially offset by higher provision expense adjusted rotce was and even excluding aoci was both data points are very strong net interest income grew to billion a new high for truist supported by strong loan growth and significant margin expansion resulted from higher shortterm rates and wellcontrolled deposit cost fee income rebounded primarily due to insurance seasonality a full quarter of benefitmall results and investment banking adjusted expenses increased sequentially mostly as expected as the impacts of higher minimum wage acquisitions and targeted investments were partially offset by the final leg of some of our cost saving efforts together these factors drove a increase in adjusted ppnr exceeding our guidance this performance also resulted in basis points of adjusted operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter of our strongest operating leverage result for the year our adjusted efficiency ratio was our best quarterly performance in truist thus far asset quality remains strong and a sequential increase in provision expense primarily reflects moderately slower economic assumptions we also deployed basis points of capital as a result of strong organic loan growth and the bankdirect acquisition our capital position remained strong relative to our risk and profitability profile and we remain confident in our ability to withstand and outperform in a range of economic scenarios turning to our full year highlights on slide gaap eps was relatively stable yearoveryear as significantly lower mergerrelated costs were offset by higher and more normal provision levels adjusted eps declined year overyear as solid adjusted ppnr growth was more than offset by the billion increase in loan loss provision expense importantly however we delivered basis points of adjusted and basis points of gaap operating leverage for the full year which was a primary metric to which we held ourselves accountable to in this was our first truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 year of operating leverage as truist and it establishes a firm foundation from which we can accelerate as we head into turning to slide digital engagement rose steadily through as a result of changing client preferences and our improved agility as truist we experienced strong growth in digital transactions and zelle in particular as transaction volume increased since the beginning of the year zelle continues to represent an increasing percentage of our overall transaction mix and highlights the importance of continuing to invest in money movement capabilities our agility and responsiveness have improved tremendously since weve migrated to one digital platform built in the cloud resulting in better client experiences we delivered three times as many production releases across retail business and wealth in as we did in and as a result our mobile app was rated an average of stars on android and ios at year end up materially from a year ago we introduced many new digital capabilities and solutions to clients in from truist one banking truist assist and expanded digital investment capabilities some of which are highlighted on the right side of the slide in our goal was to more fully activate those capabilities with our clients to improve acquisition retention and reduce cost in addition to enhanced digital capabilities for our clients our digital and technology team successfully completed the largest bank merger in years decommissioned three data centers successfully piloted a new deposit product on a nextgen realtime cloudbased core enhanced credit decisioning and underwriting across certain consumer lending platforms and upgraded our contact center technology stack and completed a network and branch wifi pilot program we have a great digital and technology team and theyve been battletested and have demonstrated an incredible agility in responding to client needs during the integration period while also keeping their eyes on the future turning to loans and leases on slide average loan balances increased a strong billion or sequentially approximately of which came from the bankdirect acquisition the improved loan growth weve experienced from recent quarters reflects our shift to execution and truists greater competitiveness for clients due to our size and capabilities as well as broader industry trends ci grew billion or overall and increased excluding bankdirect as balances increased across most cib industry verticals and product groups and ccb at recent quarters growth continues to be strong within our asset finance group as we continue to build that business with more talent product capabilities and a larger balance sheet macro trends such as supply chain management infrastructure spending inflation and choppy capital markets are also supporting growth here cib delivered growth across most industry verticals due to our combination of new client acquisition uptiering our position with existing clients acquisition activity and businessasusual liquidity management commercial community banks ci balances grew reflecting the strength of our markets and our teams focus on execution residential mortgage balances increased billion or sequentially due to previous correspondent channel production and lower prepayments excluding mortgage consumer and card balances decreased on an endof period basis primarily reflecting continued runoff in our student loan portfolio as well as our decision to pivot away from lowerreturn portfolios such as prime auto truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 at the same time we continue to invest in higherreturn consumer finance businesses such as service finance lightstream and sheffield service finance continues to grow and ended the year with over billion worth of loans ahead of the high expectations at the time of the acquisition going forward loan growth will moderate from the robust levels in as clients respond to the impact of higher rates high inflation and a slowing economy in addition we also expect growth in residential mortgage and prime auto to continue to slow as we focus our capital on higherreturn opportunities truist remains wellpositioned to advise clients across a range of economic scenarios given our broad capability talented teammates and increased capacity post integration now turning to deposits on slide average deposit balances decreased sequentially as effects of tighter monetary policy inflation and higher rate alternatives continue to weigh on balances deposit costs remained wellcontrolled reflecting the strength of our deposit franchise and our strategy to be attentive to client needs and relationships while maximizing value outside of rate paid during the fourth quarter interestbearing deposit costs increased basis points contributing to our cumulative interestbearing deposit beta of thus far as the interest rate environment evolves well continue to take a balanced approach to maintaining and managing deposit growth and rate paid given our broad access to alternative forms of funding our continued rollout of truist one and ongoing investments in treasury and payments will be key areas of focus going forward as we look to acquire new and deepen existing relationships and maximize highquality deposit growth now with that let me turn it over to mike michael b maguire chief financial officer truist financial corp great thank you bill and good morning everyone im going to be begin on slide for the fourth for the quarter taxable equivalent net interest income rose a very strong to billion primarily due to ongoing margin expansion and strong loan growth deposit costs were wellcontrolled and reflect the strength of our deposit franchise purchase accounting accretion decreased million and is expected to continue to gradually diminish reported net interest margin increased basis points and core net interest margin improved basis points as a result of higher shortterm interest rates alongside wellcontrolled deposit costs overall we maintain a balanced approach to managing interest rate risk maintaining modest upside to higher shortterm interest rates while having some downside protection when and if interest rates begin to decline looking to slide fee income rebounded during the quarter increasing million or sequentially the improvement was largely attributable to seasonality in insurance and the benefitmall acquisition as well as higher investment banking and lendingrelated fee income insurance income increased million largely due to seasonality and a full quarter of benefitmall results organic revenue for the full year grew driven by a firm pricing environment new business and strong retention investment banking and trading income increased million as higher investment banking fees and strong core trading results in the quarter were partially offset by negative impacts from cvadva truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 for the full year investment banking income declined which we believe it compares favorably to overall industry fee performance as the partnership between cib and other lines of business continues to grow and our momentum builds strategic hiring within cib over the past two years has also led to improved lead table ph standards fee income declined compared to a year ago primarily driven by declines in marketsensitive businesses such as investment banking wealth and mortgage and partially offset by organic and inorganic growth in insurance overdraft fees also declined from approximately million in to approximately million in as a result of the actions we took last year to eliminate a host of overdraftrelated fees and the continued introduction of truist one banking to new and existing clients we expect overdraft fees to decline another as we move from yearend to yearend while fee income remains below its potential were optimistic that our investments in key areas such as insurance investment banking and wealth will pay off as markets normalize and our irm execution continues to progress turning to slide reported noninterest expense increased million or sequentially merger and restructuring costs rose million linkedquarter and exceeded our october guide by million due to higher thanexpected restructuring charges related to planned facility and branch reductions that will occur in these were businessasusual decisions unrelated to the moe and have solid financial returns as bill indicated we will have no more restructuring charges or incremental operating expenses related to the moe going forward we would anticipate restructuring costs related to prior acquisition activity and other ph bauexpensed normal rationalization efforts it is difficult to forecast these with accuracy but we would anticipate approximately million to million for adjusted noninterest expense increased million or primarily due to the effects of our nonqualified plan excluding changes associated with the nonqualified plan adjusted expense rose sequentially fairly consistent with our outlook from october personnel expense increased million half of which was from changes in the nonqualified plan and half of which was from the recent increase in our minimum wage these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in marketing expense and a million reduction in other expense the decline in other expense was driven by lower operational losses which have decreased for two consecutive quarters as recent investments in talent technology and process have begun to mitigate our fraudrelated costs compared to the fourth quarter of adjusted noninterest expenses grew by as a result of the increase in minimum wage investments in revenuegenerating businesses technology and acquisitions higher call center staffing to support our clients postmerger and a normalizing te spend for the full year adjusted expenses were billion up modestly from the billion baseline in this performance is strong reflecting the achievement of the billion net cost save target overall we continue to focus on generating expense reductions in certain areas to fund longerterm investments in talent and technology and to generate ongoing operating leverage below the line our fourth quarter results also reflected an effective tax rate of down from in the third quarter primarily due to annual trueups for state income tax returns truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 moving to slide asset quality is strong reflecting our prudent risk culture and diverse loan portfolio net chargeoffs increased basis points to basis points largely due to seasonality in indirect auto and lower recoveries the allowance increased million reflecting strong loan growth and alll ratio was stable at as the effects of a moderately slower economic outlook were offset by highquality organic loan growth and the bankdirect acquisition excluding the bankdirect portfolio which has extremely low losses recycles the alll ratio would have increased approximately basis points continuing to slide our cet1 ratio decreased from to as we deployed capital to support strong organic loan growth and closed the bankdirect acquisition we also continue to pay a strong dividend at per share overall our capital position remains strong relative to our risk and profitability profile we expect organic capital generation to improve in due to the elimination of moerelated costs and more focused loan growth all of which will provide additional flexibility and opportunities for truist finally our liquidity position remains strong with an average lcr of and access to multiple funding sources our securities portfolio remains high quality at governmentguaranteed and continues to produce approximately billion of cash flow per quarter which has supported our loan growth turning to slide where ill provide guidance for the first quarter and full year looking into we expect revenues to decline to relative to primarily driven by two fewer days impacting net interest income in addition to typical seasonal patterns in investment banking card and payments and service charges amongst other factors adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase to as higher pension expense and fdic premiums along with seasonally higher personnel expenses are partially offset by ongoing cost discipline for the full year we expect revenues to increase to driven largely by strong net interest income growth and modestly improving fees adjusted expenses are anticipated to increase to as a result of higher pension expense higher fdic premiums the full annual impact of our minimum wage increase and the acquisitions that closed throughout these four factors drive about of our yearoveryear increase given these factors we are targeting adjusted operating leverage to be basis points or greater which will be more than three times our pace in we also expect the net chargeoff ratio to be between and basis points in given our expectations for continued normalization across the loan portfolio lastly excluding discrete items we expect our effective tax rate will be approximately which translates to approximately if you model it on a taxable equivalent basis now ill hand it back to bill for some final remarks william h rogers jr chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great thanks mike and continuing on slide the fourth quarter was a strong finish to a year that was strategic and financial turning point for truist the pivot from integrating to operating is real its palpable and it can be evidenced across a number of dimensions truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 loan production in the fourth quarter was near the highest its been at truist this is despite some intentional reductions in certain consumer categories commercial community bank loan and deposit production in both the fourth quarter and full year was the strongest weve had at truist importantly leftlead relationships within ccb were up in reflecting our increased strategic relevance and advisory capabilities with clients branch deposit and checking unit production in the fourth quarter increased and respectively compared to the year ago quarter as teammates become more confident with processes and systems but also improved solutions and capabilities our wealth line of business has had three consecutive quarters of adding net new advisors and organic asset flows continue to be positive integrated relationship management activity across the company gained momentum throughout the year as a result of more focus increased alignment and improved reporting as we ended the year with a increase in qualified referral activity excluding mortgage relative to average client satisfaction scores for retail and small business banking are ascending and in the fourth quarter reached their highest levels for the year in key areas that include our branches call centers retail digital experiences and small business our digital app ratings ended the year as one of the leaders in our peer group after starting near the bottom the financial benefits of this momentum can be seen with the fourth quarter operating leverage being the strongest of the year and adjusted ppnr building each quarter so to conclude on slide our fourth quarter results reaffirm that truist is on the right path and im highly optimistic about our ability to realize our significant postintegration potential as summarized on our investment thesis our goal financially is to produce strong growth and profitability and to do so with less volatility than our peers will be our first full year as truist with zero integration activity and our priorities are very clear core execution to actualize truist and our purpose harvesting irm opportunities continuing to digitize and automate our processes and operations and maintaining a strong profitability profile well also raise the bar on ourselves focusing on the kpis that drive total shareholder return and ensuring executive compensation targets reflects our potential not just our business mix while economic uncertainty remains high truist is in a position of strength across a broad range of outcomes because of our diverse business mix conservative credit culture balanced approach to interest rate risk management strong profitability profile and our strong riskadjusted capital position and most notably our significant performance momentum as we continue to shift from integration to executional excellence and purposeful growth ankur let me turn it back over to you and begin the qa ankur vyas executive vice president headinvestor relations truist financial corp thanks bill jess at this time if you would explain how our listeners can participate in the qa session as you do that id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary question and one followup so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible today truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and another reminder to please limit yourself to one question and one followup question operator instructions our first question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo securities your line is open please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi can you hear me william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah we got you mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great so it looks like im going to push the corvette analogy it looks like youre guiding for your corvette of a franchise to go from first to second gear or maybe its second to third but youre guiding for twice as much revenue growth youre guiding for three times more operating leverage but i and others are going to be unsure if youre going to be able to get that given your head counts up quarteroverquarter in the fourth quarter you have nii pressures from deposits and you have capital market headwinds so i guess the question is whats your degree of confidence with this guidance given some of the pressures and the internal expenses and along with that your merger saves are they all in now or do you still get some ph hale effect that you benefit in the first quarter i know you disconnected three data centers thanks william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah yeah mike let me start with the last one first yes theyre all done so were entering the year with a positive aspect of not sort of having those adjustments every quarter to talk about and then as it relates to the confidence in our guidance there is a lot of market uncertainty so we have to accept that i mean theres things could change the inflation what are clients going to be doing but we will have our own internal momentum we talked about it i mean your analogy of first second or third or fourth i dont how many gears a corvette has but we continue to grind through that so we have our momentum that were creating and you saw that in some of the production numbers i think you see that in some of the deposit betas you see that in terms of our ability to i think outperform both in the asset liability performance of our company as well as in the stability of some of the fee businesses so got a great insurance business weve got great momentum within our investment banking business it isnt just marketdriven i mean these are also relationships that were developing with our commercial core businesses so were expanding our capabilities and our prowess truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 so while there are headwinds and we accept those and understand those we have enough of our own tailwinds i sort of call it the truist tailwind thats just our increased performance our increased capacity and when i offset those mike thats what sort of gives me the confidence in the guidance is i can feel enough tailwinds to know that we can offset some of the headwinds that we may be facing mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then a followup youve mentioned good insurance maybe this is for you bill and mike you have an insurance operation where publicly comparable peers trade at like three times the valuation of truist so a lot of press no comments from you guys although you did present in boston about this business how do you think about monetizing some of that unrealized value that trapped value so that shareholders might benefit more or is this just part of your firm forever and you would never consider a move like that william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah mike i mean i think one i respect the question but i think youve got to respect that as it relates to specific market rumors or speculation i just cant comment on that but i can comment in fact that we really like the insurance business and weve been in the insurance business for a long time just celebrated the 100th year anniversary so that was sort of cool weve been supporting the insurance business from acquisitions so theyve been able to grow both i think very competitively from a organic and inorganic basis but its also a consolidating business we want to make sure that were always providing the right level of support for that insurance business to continue to grow and continue to be really valuable contribution for our shareholders mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i was just wondering if you can provide us little breakdown detail between inside your revenue growth guide to the year just generally speaking what are you expecting for nii versus fees and what curve rate curve are you using in your nii forecast michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp hey ken its mike ill take that one i guess starting with the last question on the rate curve our outlook is that well see two rate hikes in the first quarter ph basis points a piece in february and march and see a policy rate stable until november where we would expect a cut which obviously at the end of the year probably doesnt have much of an impact on our nii perspective breaking revenue for the year into two components from an nii perspective the way i think about it is we obviously had really strong growth in the second half in particular also had very nice margin expansion truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 so we have a really nice exit velocity from an nii perspective we believe we have a little bit of asset sensitivity left so we do have the opportunity to realize some of the upside of the hikes in the first quarter and well have as bill mentioned slowing loan growth but those two factors combined we think give us a stable outlook for q1 nii and then for the rest of the year that we believe will stay relatively stable some pressure on in the nims offset by some modest amount of loan growth on a yearoveryear basis just given the average loan growth that we would expect thatll be we think very nice growth and frankly will drive the majority of the growth potential in the revenue guide from a fee perspective i think a couple of put and a few takes we expect to continue to have good performance from the insurance business which is growing nicely on an organic basis as well as realizing the full benefit of the acquisitions that we completed in our investment banking business we believe has some potential to benefit from improvements in market conditions probably more likely in the second half than the first half and then i think well have a little bit of pressure we would expect there to be pressure on the residential mortgage business as well as the service charges and overdraft fees on deposits ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay great and then a followup on deposits cumulative interestbearing deposit beta through the fourth quarter you guys were in the mid last time i dont think yet youve given us an idea of what you think the cumulative to be this cycle do you have any views on that at this point in terms of the direction and the endpoint thank you michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah ken ill take that one again look have been very pleased by how the betas have been performed so far theyve outperformed our expectations on a pretty consistent basis we obviously are seeing some acceleration of rate pursuing behaviors and seeing pressure on balances well unchartered territory in many respects we think we will get through the last cycle perhaps even high approaching and even hitting by the time were to the last hike william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp and ken its bill the other thing id add is just the strength of our deposit franchise so you sort of asked about our relative deposit beta performance but were really experiencing what we hope we would experience as truist were sitting in great markets weve got a average share our competitors are mainly large banks weve introduced some great new product capability in truist one our branch productions up our teammates are really doing a great job the ubiquity or presence the ability to amortize your marketing and be more effective so our just strength of our overall deposit franchise is starting to manifest itself and show itself of what we thought we could create and create in truist ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay thank you guys operator our next question comes from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open please go ahead truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning can you talk about your capital priorities and remind us what your nearterm capital target is please william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah matt our priorities remain the same in terms of the top four priorities i mean the first is to continue to invest in our business and weve seen a lot of opportunity to do that i mean youve seen the asset growth in our business and rwa growth and we feel really good about the opportunities to invest in that the second is to have a secure and growing dividend base thats important to our both our institutional and our retail shareholders so thats a critical and then the third is ma opportunities ph and organic opportunities and youve seen weve been active thereve been some have been smaller by nature but weve seen opportunities to enhance our businesses mostly in the insurance business but also on the technology side and some capability side and some talent side that weve added in those areas and then the fourth is the is share repurchase and for us that just hasnt been as big a priority because weve done a lot in the first three of those priorities and as it relates to target i mean weve been sort of careful to say were really we like where were operating at right now so we think weve got the capacity to do the things we need to do we think given our risk profile given our stressadjusted risk profile we think were in a really strong position from a capital perspective but also as mike noted in his comments we accrete if you think about our earnings profile but also the fact that our moe expenses come off were sort of in a unique position to accrete capital so well accrete about basis points worth of capital weve been using some of that for those first two three priorities that we talked about so i think on balance well probably see capital increase but were comfortable that weve enough capital to execute our strategies and support our businesses matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay and then so hypothetically if you say won the lottery for billion what would you do with that capital i dont think youre going to change your organic growth the dividend is kind of capped by regulation so youre left with the last two buckets of ma and buybacks and if you walk into that billion what would you do with it william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp i dont want to answer a hypothetical lottery question because were not lottery ticket buyers thats not part of our strategy ph well i think weve got thats based on can we support our businesses longterm and can we provide the capital they need to grow and were going to use all of our strategies and all of our capabilities to ensure that were supporting businesses in their growth matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp thanks matt operator our next question comes from john mcdonald at autonomous research your line is open please go ahead john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research yes hi good morning was wondering if you could give us some color on how you see credit unfolding for truist this year and what youve baked into the chargeoff guidance that you give for this year william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah clarke can you take that clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp john this is clarke ill take that one as you saw we have basis points in losses in q4 that reflected primarily seasonality normal seasonality in our consumer segments and a little bit of normalization and as mike mentioned we had lower recoveries in our wholesale areas so thats what the delta was from q3 to q4 and then what the so were seeing is the consumer segments are normalizing and also just remind you all that the whole industrys had anemic wholesale and cre losses over the last couple years so were pretty similar to that so therefore wed expect losses to return toward the lower range of our longterm loss range of to basis points as we go through and it just depends upon how the economy performs and thats why you see that reflected in our guidance of to bps john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay thanks clarke and then for mike mike on the expense outlook for adjusted expense growth midsingle digits how much of that is kind of pulling through acquisitions you added at the end of last year and how much of that is kind of core expense growth and investments thanks michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp sure in i believe the annualized ma impact was 127orso million dollars so thats about of that growth as youll recall in the guide we talked about these four components that were where we have quite a bit of visibility into and frankly not much flexibility and thats the pension the ma impact the annualized impact of minimum wage and the fdic expense and those components in the aggregate are about hope that helps john mcdonald q analyst autonomous research okay got it yeah thats great thank you truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala at bank of america your line is open please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning i guess just wanted to william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc follow up bill on the capital allocation question one just given there are obviously a lot of speculation when you talk to investors around the insurance business if you can talk to given the multiple difference between insurance companies creating a times fee do you still think it makes sense in terms of deploying capital to do more acquisitions on the insurance front as opposed to buying back stock and on the other hand i would love to hear how you would think about maybe moving away from that business but giving up a very defensive revenue stream william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ebrahim and again im not going to comment on sort of where we are from a speculative standpoint other than to say we love the insurance business we want the insurance business to grow weve done im staring at john probably acquisitions over time so weve got a really good framework in assisting that business to grow but as i mentioned in my earlier comments it is a consolidating business so we want to make sure that weve got all the flexibility and capability to create capital and support all of our businesses and their growth ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess just taking a step back with the merger integration done the cost behind you remind us in terms of what weve not heard so far on the call is the scale benefits as we think about goforward in terms of picking up bigger deals on the lending side on the fee revenue side just remind us of the revenue synergies we should expect from the truist franchise on a goforward basis and why you can outperform just the peers within the market or within your asset size set william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah great question and one of them i talked about just a minute ago was the deposit franchise so the scale and the ubiquity and the size and the prowess that we have in our markets i think is a distinct advantage and you see that the other component of that is the markets that were in so not only is it scale but its scale in the right places so we have markets that i think will sustain sort of any economic environment with a higher beta to the upside and a lower beta to the downside so markets where we have a lot of inmigration versus outmigration and business development and growth so thats one component truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 you mentioned the capital markets side and i talked about the community bank the prowess that weve seen there increase and leftleads and those type of things that comes from scale that comes from an ability to be more relevant to our clients to have discussions with them that we werent having before to be more strategic and to be in that leftlead spot versus that rightlead spot and we all know the economics of that i mean the economics of multiples of where you are in the spectrum so our relevance is not only related to our scale but also related to our product and capabilities weve tried to sort of put a number on them and id say indiscernible sort of back of the envelope kind of math i mean its at least of sort of the growth that weve seen in our investment banking business we can attribute to being more scaleoriented again not taking outsized positions but taking positions that are on the left versus the right and the economics that come along with that and then everything to do with all the operations and efficiency so everything to do with the base that we operate from we just have more opportunity to create more efficiency so when we do something that has previously had tens of millions of dollars of impact today it can have million and million of impact because youre doing it across a bigger base and a bigger capability the ability to negotiate better contracts with our providers and our partners and we saw a lot of that in the merger our ability to go in and be more relevant and more important to them get terms that we think better reflect that mike what else am i forgetting and that list because its a long list i mean its a great question and one we probably ought to talk more about michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah i think ph its really moving more relevant on capabilities more relevant on size youre seeing it in the results whether it be the ability to manage expenses indiscernible william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp financial markets pricing on debt deals indiscernible michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah no exactly right william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah so the list is pretty long ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc all right thank you operator our next question comes from stephen scouten at piper sandley sic piper sandler your line is open

relations truist financial corp stephen are you there maybe jess we go to the next person and see if stephen can get back in after operator absolutely we will do that well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning bill and good morning mike william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp gerard how are you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us youve got some good guidance on the operating leverage for being i think mike you said about three times the level of what you achieved in but i noticed that in the third and fourth quarters the operating leverage was higher than what youre hoping to achieve in can you share with us why there seems to be some slowdown in that net operating leverage relative to the fourth quarter or third quarters of michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah sure gerard as we look into i think a couple of factors one weve obviously was a year where we had outsized particularly in the second half loan growth and net interest margin expansion which obviously was a great tailwind on the revenue side as we look into we expect to continue to have nice growth from a yearoveryear perspective but we are expecting that nii trend to really stabilize and frankly were going to begin to experience some pressure on the nim side probably in the second quarter from an expense perspective we also mentioned there are few just structural expenses that are in the plan for that when combined add up to about yearoveryear change now we obviously intend to make investments beyond those four categories in our clients in our teammates and in other strategic investment priorities but that structural expense growth is there so again feel good about that sort of with upside operating leverage guide and feel good about our frankly our revenue guide as well so hopefully thats helpful to you gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good no i appreciate that and then as a followup many of you and many of your peers and yourselves are obviously building up loan loss reserves the outlooks that people are using are calling for a weaker economy but we dont seem to be seeing that yet in any of the numbers and if you look at the spreads in the highyield market they havent blown out one of your competitors or peers just they pointed out that the spreads on commercial loans still are pretty tight so i dont know bill if when you talk to your customers what are they truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 seeing that maybe we might not see as much of a downturn as everybodys kind of forecasting right now later this year william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah i mean i think you pointed it out i mean the data are confusing theres just no doubt about that i mean you see some positives and you see some negatives if you look at just think about the last few days retail sales were not really very strong sort of a poor christmas selling season youve seen inflation being a bigger part of what people do and supply chain seems to sort of be reconciling itself so i think its more of a prospective just there has to be higher impact from higher inflation and whether thats reduced hiring from our clients whether thats reduced capital investment and all those type things and in fairness its a little more prospective so we talk to our clients and we look at our portfolios today things are great i mean as clarke mentioned our commercial portfolio looks fantastic our clients are in really good shape but rents will come due things will payments will come due things will change over time so i think its just a little more of trying to understand where the economys ph pucks going versus where it is today because i think today it actually looks pretty strong and clarke what would add to that clarke r starnes iii a vice chair chief risk officer truist financial corp well i would just say to your point bill clients balance sheets their liquidity their financial positions are very good going into this obviously depending on what happens in the economy the impact of higher rates input costs all of these things were monitoring very closely with our clients ph toward were looking at things like cre and the term risk and things like ph office so i think were just looking out what could be some of those impacts from the if the economy does slow and obviously thats reflected in everyones provisioning models but to your point the actual performance today and the nearterm outlook is still strong william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp we didnt talk about the consumer side i mean on the consumer side it is normalizing and in some cases normalized to where we are right now so you do start to see some of that weve done a lot of work looking at sort of our lower income borrowers and some of the challenges that they may be facing from inflation maybe theyre not facing it today but thats starting to build as they start to withdraw a little more deposit so it is more of a prospective thing than a current thing and were all trying to find the right calibration of where things might land and we dont want to undershoot that runway i mean we want to be conservative we want to be appropriate and think through all the risks that could exist in the portfolio gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you appreciate the color william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp great truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi i just want to understand a little bit more i know we touched it in a couple of different ways but youve got the revenue outlook for up to and what im hearing is loan growth slowing slightly from the level you have now but really not that much and that the fees fee growth will be lower due to some of the things youve mentioned around mortgage but that loan growth is likely to be a little above that adjusted revenue number with the pressure coming a little bit in fees and then also nim pulling up in the back of the year is that a fair summary william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah betsy i think ive said it maybe a little bit differently and i think mike was trying to make this point i mean were sort of if you look at sort of nii for the fourth quarter were assuming thats sort of stable through the year so thats the big driver maybe if you think about whats the big bus in the revenue guidance its nii being stable and thats not loan growth at the kind of revenue numbers i mean that loan growths going to pull back a little bit some of thats going to be intentional on our part a lot of its going to be returnoriented just making sure that we have got really really great relevance with our clients and in some cases the fee businesses we expect to be up we expect insurance to be up we expect it to continue in its sort of highsingledigit organic growth we still have some inorganic momentum from some of the acquisitions weve go we expect investment banking to actually return and increase its revenue growth thatll probably be a little more backendweighted in fairness but as we see where markets come out but the big driver is sort of the nii fourth quarter where we are and that moving forward on a stabilized basis thats the biggest driver betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and i know in the press release you talked a bit about having managing your deposit costs well and tightly et cetera can you give us a sense as to how you think about the trajectory of that line item as we go through william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp yeah ill do it at a high level i mean it will be continue to be slightly down so i mean i think thats that trend will continue i think on a relative basis were showing deposit betas that are more reflective of our opportunity and as the costs continue to grow i mean deposit betas will increase mike i dont know if you want to comment sort of specifically how were thinking about that truist financial corp tfc corrected transcript q4 earnings call 19jan2023 michael b maguire a chief financial officer truist financial corp yeah we mentioned in an earlier question that we see betas increasing whether they reached the level or not well see id say the other trend betsy which is consistent with what others are expecting and whats consistent with our expectation is were still seeing a remixing from dda and interestbearing so that makes sense and were still well above where we were sort of prestimulus we were in the high we peaked during the sort of height of stimulus in the were back at like right now and going to and probably approaching over time and i think bill you hit it right i mean i think were seeing some deposit balance pressure in the aggregate and we would expect that to continue in perhaps moderate a bit betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay got it all right william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp indiscernible betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah william h rogers jr a chairman chief executive officer truist financial corp you got it thats great
