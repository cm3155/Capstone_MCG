high level commentary regarding the quarter earnings documents including forwardlooking statements are available under the investor relations section of our website these disclosures cover our presentation materials prepared comments and the qa segment of todays call with that ill now turn it over to john john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp thank you dana and thank you all for joining our call today before we get started i want to mention that were taking a slightly different approach to our call today rather than walk you through our results in detail we will speak to key highlights we think are most important and then open it up for your questions hopefully youll find this approach to be a little more efficient use of your time we are very pleased with our third quarter results we reported earnings of million resulting in earnings per share of a increase over the prior year we continue to experience nice revenue growth while prudently managing expenses generating the highest adjusted pretax preprovision income in over a decade our core banking operations remain strong we achieved record levels of deposits with growth across all three business segments we continue to see growth in consumer and small business checking accounts and despite the uncertain environment our customers appear to be relatively healthy and are appropriately adapting their spending habits as a result most credit metrics improved and weve been very pleased with a significant decline in loan deferrals our customer assistance program appears to have worked as intended with the vast majority of customers who previously received deferrals now return to normal payment schedule our results also reflect the success of simplify and grow our continuous improvement initiative we continue to carefully manage expenses while making strategic investments to grow our business our third quarter adjusted efficiency ratio was the lowest in years and our investments in mortgage and digital are paying off yeartodate mortgage production is more than double that of last year our focus on enhancing the digital experience is also resonating with customers digital logins are up mobile deposits are up and digital account openings are up and our recently redesigned iphone app currently has a star rating thus far the southeast seems to have fared generally better economically during the pandemic than other areas of the country states across our footprint were among the last to shelterinplace and the first to reopen as a result the unemployment rate has generally been around basis points below the national average contributing to a relatively stronger gdp we remain cautiously optimistic about the pace of economic recovery regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 and our footprint and client sentiment continues to improve as a result given what we know today we believe the credit risk in our loan portfolio is appropriately reserved and losses will be manageable before i turn the call over to david i want to recognize barb godin earlier this quarter barb announced her plan to retire by the end of the year so this will be barbs last earnings call barbara will retire after years in banking she joined regions in and was named chief credit officer during the height of the financial crisis over the last years as chief credit officer barb has done a terrific job leading our credit risk organization through a period of tremendous change over that time barbs contribution was recognized by the american banker as one of the most powerful women in banking shes truly done a great job for regions and well miss her presence every day i hope you all will join me in thanking barb for all shes done and congratulating her on a welldeserved retirement thank you barb with that i thank you for your time and attention and well now turn it over to david david jackson turner chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp thank you john lets start with balance sheet average adjusted loans decreased while commercial pipelines remain healthy business customers continue to deleverage and repay their defensive draws taken earlier in the year while commitments have not changed appreciably line utilization is at historic lows consumer growth was driven by very strong mortgage production which has been more than double yeartodate versus the prior year with respect to deposits balances increased record levels again this quarter growth in corporate bank deposits was driven by clients consolidating their liquidity as well as increased benefit from supply chain efficiencies and declines in working asset levels consumer deposits also increased as we continued to grow consumer checking accounts and customers have adjusted spending and savings behaviors lets shift to net interest income and margin which remains a source of stability for regions despite a challenging market interest rate backdrop linked quarter net interest income increased aided by our hedging program the deployment of excess cash into securities and a number of items that may not repeat which are described on the slide these benefits were offset by lower loan balances elevated cash levels impacted net interest margin which declined to strong deposit growth drove cash levels at the federal reserve higher averaging roughly billion this coupled with billion of average low spread ppp loans reduced the margin by basis points within the quarter and basis points linked quarter we continued to work on reducing elevated cash levels and added approximately billion of agency mortgage backed securities and agency commercial mortgage backed securities additionally we reduced wholesale borrowings through a billion bank debt tender and the early extinguishment of approximately million of fhlb advances given that the majority of our hedges are now active and our ability to further reduce deposit cost our balance sheet is largely insulated from the low shortterm rate environment in fact additional income from lower shortterm rates helped to offset some of the longterm rate degradation loan hedges added approximately million to net interest income and basis points to the margin recall our hedges have roughly fiveyear tenures and at quarter end pretax unrealized market valuation of billion an important differentiator and source of regulatory capital in the coming years lower longterm interest rates regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 negatively impacted net interest income and net interest margin for an increase in securities premium amortization and the continued reinvestment of our portfolio of fixedrate loans and securities premium amortization was million and included the impact of ginnie mae buyouts that arent likely to repeat at the same level looking ahead to the fourth quarter uncertainty about the timing of ppp loan forgiveness and the related fee acceleration may create volatility in net interest income after level setting for third quarter items that may not repeat and excluding ppp loan forgiveness we expect net interest income to be relatively flat to modestly lower as hedging benefits and further declines in deposit cost will help to offset continued pressure from longterm rates asset remixing and runoff excluding ppp and excess cash our core net interest margin is expected to stabilize in the notably our shift to deploy billion of cash into securities will reduce the normalized margin by basis points but benefit net interest income now lets take a look at fee revenue and expense adjusted noninterest income increased quarterover quarter repeat record mortgage income and had another solid quarter in capital markets service charges increased but remained below prioryear levels while improving we believe changes in customer behavior could keep service charges below prepandemic levels we estimate consumer service charges will remain approximately million to million per quarter behind prioryear levels card and atm fees have recovered compared to the prior year primarily driven by increased debit card spend however credit card spend continues to be slightly behind prioryear levels lets move on to noninterest expense adjusted noninterest expenses were million and represented a decrease quarteroverquarter excluding covidrelated expenses and the impact of changes in market valuation on employee benefit accounts adjusted expenses were million we have a proven track record of prudent expense management since announcing our continuous improvement initiative in weve held adjusted expenses relatively flat while continuing to invest in technology products and people to grow our business continuous improvement is ingrained in our culture we have completed approximately of the current list of initiatives and are continuing to identify new opportunities every day we are facing an uncertain operating environment and to the extent revenue is challenged we will look for additional efficiency opportunities and from an asset quality perspective overall credit remains generally in line with our expectations from the second quarter the credit loss provision totaled million resulting in an allowance equal to of total loans and of total nonaccrual loans excluding ppp loans our allowance for credit losses increased to of total loans nonperforming loans increased basis points to of total loans primarily attributable to downgrades in retail investor real estate and energy business services criticized loans and total delinquencies decreased and respectively while troubled debt restructured loans increased the improvements in criticized loans were generally in retail where we noted improvements due to strong anchor tenants additionally some improvements were experienced in aspects of energy and manufacturing annualized net chargeoffs were basis points a basis point improvement over the prior quarter we are cautiously optimistic about the pace of the economic recovery in our footprint however we also recognize we remain in the highly uncertain environment assuming positive trends continue we do not believe further increases to the allowance are necessary reductions in the allowance will depend on the timing of chargeoffs regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 and greater certainty with respect to the path of the economic recovery while chargeoffs can be volatile we currently expect the fourth quarter to range from to basis points this range reflects the historical pattern of elevated consumer chargeoffs in the fourth quarter predicting the timing of net chargeoffs depends on many variables including any additional stimulus however based on what we know today we would expect chargeoffs to peak around mid2021 we continued to refine our view of highrisk portfolios through ongoing conversations with customers and market observations the portion of our portfolio considered to be at the highest risk of potential loss due to the pandemic declined from billion at the end of last quarter to billion at september a roll forward of the highrisk portfolios is included in the appendix wrapping up the capital our common equity tier ratio increased approximately basis points to an estimated and capital ratios are expected to continue increasing over the next several quarters so in summary we feel really good about the quarter pretax preprovision income remains strong expenses are wellcontrolled credit quality is showing resilience capital and liquidity are solid and we are optimistic on the prospect for the economic recovery to continue in our markets with that were happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you the floor is now open for questions operator instructions your first question is from ken usdin of jefferies john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning ken ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey good morning everyone i was wondering if you could and congratulations and best of luck to barb i should say on behalf of everyone just on the loan side obviously customers as you mentioned building liquidity you saw the ci continue to decline as the industry did can you just talk to us about when you make the point about the footprint acting better relative to other parts of the country what you see as far as that delicate balance between customers holding liquidity and then starting to see activity and the need for borrowing increase especially as you think about the ci portfolio thanks david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah ken this is david so as we think through generally our bank in terms of loan growth weve been kind of a gdp plus a little bit has been our expectation clearly with the liquidity sitting in the hands of customers theyre going to use that first before theyll tap into committed lines of credit if youre a business or spending or borrowing money if youre on the consumer side what were looking at is our production our production continues to be robust on the commercial side but our utilization is very low and it is low for everybody we dont know when that will bottom out some have called it already were not real sure but we think given the commitment there that it is just a matter of time you start regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 getting infrastructure spending you get a little momentum going in the economy we could see loan growth picking up in were probably not going to see that in our fourth quarter which is why weve given you the guide on nii that we have john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah i would just add ken i think we get past the election i think we get a little more sense about the direction of the economy there are a number of our customers who are have adapted their operations to the covid environment are doing fine and are thinking about potentially expanding their business or they are seeing a need to increase inventories because they are at generally low alltime low levels and yet theyre not in a hurry to do that until theres a little more uncertainty about what happens postelection so i think itll be as david said early in before we have a better feel for whether we see loan growth exceeding gdp ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and a followup question on the swaps portfolio just looking back at a slide you showed last quarter theres still like billion to still come online correct that arent live yet so versus the million that you saw in nii this quarter how much more increment add do you still expect to come from the additional swaps that havent gone live yet thank you david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah ken so the youre right the last tranche will come due in the fourth quarter getting the full run rate from what we did last quarter and benefiting the next slug coming in in the fourth quarter we think that million goes to 97ish million million so well get million million more per quarter and of course all these are fiveyear tenors from the date they become active so couple million dollars i guess is the answer ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thanks a lot operator your next question is from michael rose of raymond james john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning can you hear me john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yes we can regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey how are you yeah so im sorry if i missed this i got on a little bit late but can you walk through some of the deposit repricing opportunities you may have in coming quarters and how should we think about the loan to deposit ratio as we move into a more normalized backdrop hopefully later next year is there a certain level that you guys would want to run at i know excess liquidity tends to stick around in these zero interest rate environments but just looking for ways that you can potentially deploy some of that excess liquidity thanks david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp sure so our deposit growth continues to be very strong thats coming through the growth in consumer checking accounts operating accounts for businesses its businesses bringing cash back to regions and so i would say our deposit growth has been a little quicker little faster than we had anticipated and that could persist into the fourth quarter i think youre right to point out that our deposit cost while basis points now we believe theres still running room to take that down a couple basis points over time if you look at our interestbearing deposit cost at basis points i think we have running room there more so than we probably have in the past weve if you look at the peers that are released thus far everybody is bringing that down quite a bit we probably could pick that up a bit were going to challenge ourselves as we go into the fourth quarter and into was there another part of the question a loan to deposit david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp oh loan to deposit ratio mike we really dont solve for that thats kind of an outcome weve historically run a lower loan to deposit ratio than our peers because of our deposit franchise which is really our competitive advantage if we could be perfect deploying it i think being in the low range would be great but weve kind of been in that middle for a long time of course everybody is lower today and so we have the liquidity to make all the loans to creditworthy borrowers today were excited about that just loan growth good loan growth is hard to come by at this point but were like a cold spring ready when we believe that infrastructure spending happens michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc thats very helpful maybe just as one followup the deposit service charges came back a little bit further than i would have thought this quarter i think some of that obviously has to do with some of the deposit growth but can you just give us an update on how the normalization of service charges and maybe credit card usage has ramped up here and how you expect it to play out into next year thanks david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 yeah so our service charges did come back a bit were seeing strength still in the consumer were seeing spending pick up a bit our debit card spend is ahead of where we were last year not so much on credit card spend its still percentage points behind where weve been in the past right now our run rate and weve put in our comments probably million to million a month behind prepandemic levels which is million million per quarter we dont forecast that improving appreciably at this juncture well have to see we got a new potential wave of stimulus which will continue to put that pressure and maintain that pressure at that run rate level so i would not count on that at this point coming back to the prepandemic level john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah were seeing change in customer behavior which i think ultimately is a good thing so we are depending upon growth in consumer checking accounts as real catalyst for driving additional fee income and the good news is that consumer checking accounts are growing and as a result of that were seeing a pickup in fee income associated with those accounts michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc exactly okay thank you so much for the color john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah operator your next question is from john pancari of evercore isi john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning john david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning on the credit front i know your guidance and you indicated that losses are likely to continue to rise here and given that expectation if you do see chargeoffs continue to rise you do expect that given what you know now that that could lead to incremental reserve releases from here david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp well let me start and ill let barb kind of weigh in want to be careful about the word reserve releases we clearly believe we have our allowance established at the appropriate math to cover losses in our portfolio through the life of the loan as we go forward were going to have chargeoffs if we did it right those chargeoffs are completely reserved for and so youll see reductions in the reserve as a result of that event the question is then what do regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 you do with the remaining reserve and how does that reserve whats the adequacy of that reserve for whats left and right now we think we have it well have to continue to evaluate that at the end of each quarter looking at all the variables which include loan growth or not how the portfolio mix may have changed with the macroeconomic variables theres a host of things that go into that when you say the word reserve release that contemplates i reserved today and tomorrow i figured out i only need so i take into income we dont anticipate that movement at this juncture theres still uncertainty out there we need to be real careful about that and make sure weve established loan loss reserves at the appropriate level which we believe we have done john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it thanks david thats helpful yet im just i should have really said all else equal so barring a change in the outlook and aside from reserves for new loan production just as chargeoffs go against what youve reserved at that should imply that youve already reserved for that and there could be reductions for that like you said so thats fine my other question on the credit front was your does the reserve already factor in some the likelihood of incremental credit migration into criticized assets in other words if we do see a continued upward trend there that do you expect that that could drive incremental additions or is that factored in david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah so when we look at life of loan we obviously have a lot of migration studies and analysis weve looked at so we can tell you when things start to age whats going to happen and theyll go into special mention and substandard doubtful loss and so we contemplate that as we establish our reserve levels so unless theres a change of what weve already estimated we wouldnt have incremental reserves for that migration john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay got it all right thank you and then if i could just ask one more sorry on the loan growth front does your comment to ken regarding the loan growth outlook near term does it imply that we could potentially see some incremental declines in loan balances near term or do you expect more stable david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp i think that for in the short term were doing a couple of things question is has the repayment of the lines bottomed out yet or not some have called that it has were not so sure so thats a piece of the risk that we have on loan growth our production is nice we do have some runoff portfolios as you know and i think netnet probably not going to see a lot of loan growth to maybe some downward and thats what equates to the maybe we have nii flat to modestly lower so all thats baked in together john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right david thank you operator your next question is from matt oconnor of deutsche bank regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning matt matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc i just want to follow up on the comments about the timing of net chargeoffs peaking maybe mid next year weve heard kind of a similar theme from other banks mid next year or back half next year is that more just like a placeholder since you dont expect a material increase in the near term or is there something kind of in the kind of what youre seeing in the commercial and consumer side that gives you confidence in that mid next year barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp hey matt its barb ill take that question yeah the reason that we say mid next year is given all of the deferral programs that are out there and again we have a uncertainty as to whats going to happen will we get a second set of relief from the government or not relative to the programs they have etcetera but based on what we know and just the way that things roll through the various delinquency buckets we would think that mid next year sometime in the second quarter probably toward the end of the second quarter could even push into the third quarter so theres just a lot of uncertainty and volatility and thats the reason we think based on all of that its probably a midyear event next year david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp barb is it fair to say the ci book its more potentially more predictable but even there with small business because of the relief thats in currently circulating through the economy its still hard to predict so more a placeholder than necessarily a indiscernible barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp thats right matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc and then on the commercial real estate does that end up being longer tailed than maybe traditional ci and consumer just given some of the dynamics with real estate and i think a lot of the commercial real estate out there is kind of pretty low ltv so there should be some patience on the part of the banks to help work that out regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp there is and were spending a lot of time with our customers on a one by one basis making amendments where we need to helping them get through what is a rough period we dont want to be fair weather bankers by any stretch but we are taking a very prudent approach in our discussions with our customers if we see that at the end of the day there isnt a light at the end of the tunnel then were having those hard discussions with them now but in general the discussions have been very very good relative to all of us working together to get through the other side of this david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp and i would say the thing that comes through in our commercial real estate portfolio is since the financial crisis weve remade that business weve significantly reduced the amount of exposure we have weve rebuilt the teams that are originating commercial real estate loans were banking very experienced regional and national developers that have good access to capital a lot of liquidity theyre involved in quality projects and really solid markets strong loan to values a combination of all those things comes together and we feel good about our investor real estate portfolio matthew oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you operator your next question is from betsy graseck of morgan stanley john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp hey betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc first barb congratulations its been great working with you all these years so really appreciate it one question for you maybe i missed it in the prepared remarks but youve got the nco guide for im sorry for in the to bps range and i thought last quarter was looking more for so im wondering is this step down in expectation for ncos something that you think is temporary given everything weve discussed with the stimulus or do you feel like theres the run rate is going to be a little bit lower than what you had been anticipating before regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp thank you very much betsy firstly i thought growing old would take a lot longer than it did but i guess its common secondly relative to your question yeah we started off the quarter we had a different view of the quarter we thought that things would not turn out as they did with our customers our customers made a lot of changes to the way in which theyre managing their finances etcetera they seem to be holding up better than what we thought having said all of that theres still a lot of volatility and so our issue is more one around timing and so as we look at that and we look at what the impacts of these deferral programs and other things are we do think that theres still going to be an impact but its just going to be pushed out sometime into now betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay no thats helpful thanks and then just followup is just a question about the footprint and what youre seeing youre in a warmer part of the country im wondering if youre seeing any kind of inmigration are you seeing business trends in the southern regions accelerate a routine faster speeds than what you see in the northern part of your region and maybe you could give us some color on that im just asking the question with the backdrop of when you could start to see some loan growth pickup as well and should you be advantaged given your footprint maybe you could speak to that thanks david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah its a great question i would say specifically about the states in the southeast where plus or minus of our deposits are those states were some of the last to shelterinplace and the first to reopen their economies in fact of the states we operate of the states we operate in were amongst the first to reopen their economies and as a result of that generally speaking the unemployment rates in those states was basis points less than the national average while the totals were still high number of small businesses that closed were more like to of small businesses versus a higher number for the national average and id say today we anticipate to of small businesses have reopened so the economies seem to be a little better than lets say the northeast where its my impression anyway based upon what i hear the number of small businesses there reopening hasnt been as has occurred as quickly as it has lets say in the south or even in the midwest markets that we operate in and were cautiously optimistic recognize that the economy still is fragile there are health issues there are social issues there are economic issues unsure about the political environment but based upon what we see there is an inmigration of people into the southeastern markets in particular leaving some of the larger cities in the north and midwest and coming to the south and so real estate values while increasing are solid we dont see a real imbalance there or runup in pricing but a lot of demand and theres availability for jobs workers here in the south and so i think again we feel pretty good cautiously optimistic about the economy recognizing there still is a lot of uncertainty betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you operator your next question is from stephen scouten of piper sandler regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co yeah thank you guys i wanted to follow back around maybe thinking about the loan loss reserve and the kind of cecl methodology appreciating not wanting to call it releasing reserves but im wondering how we could think about whats maybe elevated due to the pandemic and what would be a more normalized level if we didnt have maybe some elevated allocations to expected losses here in the near term and where that could kind of normalize over time david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp well i do think one of the things you can look at as we show you an allocation in our q of our allowance by major loan category and you can see how that compares to the allowance that existed prepandemic and thatll give you an indication of where were seeing elevated loss expectations the problem with cecl is youre having to guess through the entire life of the loan we use a twoyear reasonable and supportable period of time were in the middle of a pandemic theres a lot of volatility with macroeconomic variables theres a lot of volatility with certain industries quick serve restaurant energy transportation certain elements of transportation hospitality all those things require a lot of input to try to figure out what the allowance should be so if you looked at our highrisk areas and you started seeing that improvement which we improved billion of the highrisk category to billion you could look at those categories go back and look at the allocation of the reserve and thatll give you some idea as to where that reserve exists for us today and where those improvements over time might come from until we see more clarity with regards to the economy we dont see any need to change the reserves that we have already calculated and that can change from quartertoquarter stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co right okay but if the pandemic werent occurring instead of in a cecl environment would you think your reserve would warrant maybe sort of range or is that just too difficult to say david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp well its too difficult to say but an indicator if you want to is go back and look at our prepandemic levels that we had our adoption of cecl of this year and that will give you an idea of what we think because at that time the pandemic hadnt happened at least not in the united states stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co got it david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp so thats what we thought the actual reserve level ought to be regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co perfect helpful and then one last question just on the excess liquidity you talked about you might see additional deposit growth this quarter but how are you guys i guess thinking about that and the stickiness of that excess liquidity maybe over the next year and what you might do in the fourth quarter and beyond in terms of uses of that liquidity much as you did this quarter david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah thats kind of centered on an earlier question but i think that the growth in our deposits have come from growth in checking accounts and operating accounts in addition to existing customers that had cash that was off balance sheet looking for better return a better yield than we were paying at the time and because rates have gone down theres really no place to go so the cash has come back to us in the form of deposits also our customers are generating income our commercial customers are generating income and theyre not spending that at the pace they had before so the cash is piling up on their balance sheets theyve worked on their working capital theyre turning receivables and inventory much faster all that improves the cash cycle which ends up as deposits on our balance sheet so the question is at what point will they start using that and i think its when we get back to feeling much better about the economy they start spending fixed capital investment whatever the case may be to utilize that excess cash if you will first and then it gets into loan growth for us after that part of the reason were not spending or putting to work the excess cash we have at the fed which is about billion in round numbers is because to take the duration risk today you dont get paid a whole lot incrementally more than basis points at the fed but we think there is prospects for steepening of the yield curve regardless of who wins the election and with that and higher inflation can give us a better opportunity to deploy that excess cash than we have today if we see deposits continuing to grow at a faster clip then well step up our investments into the securities book as you just saw us do with the billion this past quarter so its a very its a balancing act that were trying to take with obviously our liquidity is very good but trying to get yield and opportunity or opportunity costs to make sure we can deploy that best we can stephen kendall scouten q analyst piper sandler co thanks thats a lot of really good color appreciate the time david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp okay operator your next question is from peter winter of wedbush securities peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc good morning regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning peter peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc you guys have obviously done a great job managing expenses such as the simplify and grow and still invest i know its early but would you expect to hold expenses relatively flat again next year and what are some of the things that youre looking at for additional expense initiatives david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah so its a great question weve done we think a really good job of holding our expenses relatively stable up over the past several years a few years less than were going to continue to work on that as we get into and well give you better guidance as we get towards the end of the year but the things that we look at were certainly wanting to leverage our continuous improvement process that john turner put in had us put in that really forces us to get better at whatever were doing every day process improvement leveraging technology the drivers of our cost base clearly number one is salaries are salaries and benefits its people cost its still of our expense base so how do we control our head count matters and as we think about that clearly theres a lot of people almost half of our people are in our branch network and weve consolidated an awful lot of branches over time we continue to look at branch consolidations we think thats been a big driver of our cost savings we have now got it down path we know when we consolidate a branch what that means for revenue and customers and so our consumer teams doing a great job of evaluating every one of our branches to see how tight we can continue to make that and as we do well save in terms of head count there were looking every area has to look at spans and layers and the commitment to head count how can we leverage technology so that when we have attrition we have technology that can take place and we wont have to backfill that person occupancy is another area again thats tied to both branches and the back office weve continued to work on consolidating square footage and were happy about that as we get our head count down furniture fixtures and equipment which are computers that people have also comes down thirdparty spend we have a head of procurement thats pretty tough on our vendors and hes also pretty tough on all of us because its a demand management approach where we think we might need a consultant and he says are you sure about that and that goes for all of us in the company i know hes smiling at that but we really have to watch that spend we have to watch travel and entertainment and thats coming down because of covid so we have places and levers to pull on expenses its really hard because we have to make investments in technology in digital in people to continue to grow revenue and grow customers for our company so while were doing that how do we keep our expenses flat and its all the things we just mentioned are areas that were focusing on peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 thats great thanks and if i could just ask one more can you guys just give an update on your thoughts around bank ma when we get a more certain environment john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp yeah our views about ma havent changed peter to this point i mean we will continue to focus on bank ma weve made a number of successful acquisitions of smaller firms that provide additional capabilities in wealth management and capital markets and the mortgage business acquiring mortgage servicing rights low income housing tax credit syndicator ma advisory firm things that youre aware of and we continue to have aspirations to do that having said that we believe that we are still in an environment where its in our best interest to just focus on executing our plan with respect to bank ma if we do that then we believe that our shareholders will benefit that will be reflected in our share price the multiple that we trade at and then we can talk about whether or not we have some interest in bank ma but today our focus is still on executing our plan peter j winter q analyst wedbush securities inc thats great thanks for taking my questions operator your next question is from erika najarian of bank of america merrill lynch erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp morning erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc so david just one followup question for me as we think about a starting point on the net interest margin ex some of the nonrecurring items of how should we think about audio gap origin of clearly youre doing a great job in terms of defending the margin and i guess how should we think about the excess cash and what you need to see in the marketplace to more aggressively deploy that excess cash so that your gap nim more reflects that core nim that you point out david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah so its a good question its a balancing act that were trying to make with regards to being paid for duration and putting that excess cash to work there or waiting for the yield curve to steepen a bit which we think if were regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 just a little bit patient we can actually have a better earning asset we understand every day we wait though were trading off change for basis points we did put some of that excess cash to work as we mentioned and kind of perversely that when we give you our core nim right anything thats sitting at the fed and the fed account were carving out from our margin but when we deploy some of that as we did our billion thats earning that weighs on our core nim it helps us on nii but it hurts our nim so whereas we were in the high before we decided to deploy the cash we think were going to be in that 330ish range so that deployment actually cost us basis points of nim but it helped our nii so i wouldnt get too wound up on the nim calculation just yet i would look at the ability to grow net interest income and having the dry powder to deploy and better loan growth when that comes along or steeper yield curve when that happens erika najarian q analyst bofa securities inc got it thank you congratulations barb barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp thank you operator your next question is from gerard cassidy of rbc john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning john good morning david david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc maybe you guys can share with us and barb congratulations on your retirement and your insights over the years and the first question is about credit i mean we all understand what the government has done has been pretty impressive in terms of the stimulus relief the federal reserve has obviously aggressively moved to bring in spreads in the open market and we have the forbearance program can you guys share with us what had been the big differences between credit because the economy collapsed and all the metrics we became accustomed to like the unemployment rate leading to higher consumer net chargeoffs those relationships havent held up in this downturn and im wondering what other than the programs i mentioned maybe thats the answer whats so different about this downturn do you think versus what we saw in and going into regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yes gerard ill take that its barb and i do think the stimulus relief is really the linchpin here its the largest thing but also our consumers and our businesses have changed their habits as well for example for consumers what were seeing is theyre not spending their money on things like the vacation that money is now just going into the bank and putting it away for i put quotes around the word a rainy day the rainy day is here but theyre being very prudent with their money of course the stimulus has really helped with that to make sure they build a bit of a nest egg for themselves as they work their way through to better times but were seeing that on the consumer side most definitely and i thought perhaps maybe we would therefore see a lot of drawdowns in things like on the consumer side our home equity lines we havent seen that or cash out refis on our mortgages we havent seen that neither so theyre being consumers are being very very good about the way theyre going about spending their money on the business side its the same thing businesses have sat back and theyve enjoyed several years of good profitability they too are looking at what does this mean for them what does this mean for their business what do i have to do to make the changes now so ive been pretty impressed with the resiliency of our economy particularly here in the south where we are where weve seen a lot of businesses and the consumers make the appropriate changes so thats whats really different than last time as well last time around as we all know gerard it was a meltdown in the mortgage the housing market thats not happened this time if anything the mortgage market is a little bit on fire relative to purchase as well as refi and thats all because of the low rates so that too is something that were also keeping our eye out for david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp gerard let me to add that so as you think about the southeastern regions in particular commercial real estate is nothing like it was one we dont have near the commitment to it that we had at that time second is the real estate values havent collapsed to barbs point that was a massive change in values on not only consumers and mortgages but on homebuilders and things of that nature we dont have that today if you go look at disposable income disposable income for consumers continues to grow as you look at the financial obligation ratio so the percentage of payments of disposable income thats been used for debt payment is very low and a part of that is the leverages while the total leverage is actually higher in consumer the ability to pay is much lower because the rate environment is so low and then the last thing would be unemployment isnt all that even either so you have to think about where is that really happening as john mentioned the unemployment rate for us in our markets is a couple hundred basis points lower than other parts of the country so its the major metros that seemed to have fared worse on that unemployment than kind of secondtier markets where we happen to operate a lot of our business gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you i appreciate the color and then as a followup david can you share with us your margin and your net interest income you guys have done a very good job in managing it as you described for us what kind of interest rate environment in lets say or would be less favorable to the way youre positioned today regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 what are you kind of on the lookout for in terms of rates going forward that could be less favorable than what youre seeing today david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp well i think not just for us but for most banks a flat yield curve is pretty is problematic we have no expectations of short rates moving either way and frankly we really dont care where they go because were virtually insulated on the low rates our biggest risk is kind of in the middle to the end of the curve where were having to redeploy our maturing fixed rate loans and securities and for us thats about billion over a month period of time so taking those cash flows and reinvesting them in this kind of rate environment where the years at lower at 70whatever basis points today its tough to make money and so if we can get a steepener going which we think we can with infrastructure spending again it doesnt matter who really wins the election on that maybe the democrats do it quicker but well see but i think a steepening yield curve is what wed like to see but flat is bad gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and barb i hope on your goingaway party theyll order you some main lobsters david and john barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp thanks gerard operator our next question is from saul martinez of ubs saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc hey john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp morning saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc good morning good morning couple quick followups first i know youre not assuming any acceleration in ppp forgiveness income in the fourth quarter but can you just tell us what your best guess is currently for forgiveness rates and what the timing of that forgiveness could be over the first half of and maybe even into the second half of if you could just kind of give us what your best estimate is right now david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah so as we think about the fourth quarter early on we thought we would see a reasonable amount of forgiveness in the fourth quarter weve had some but it hadnt been enough to really talk about we think thats regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 been pushed into the first quarter i think we get through the election maybe we get a little bit more clarity they have come up with a forgiveness form thats fairly tight that i think could be helpful well see what we havent seen is the borrowers actually calling and saying im ready for my forgiveness theyre kind of hanging out because its not really costing them anything at this point so we need if we get a little bit of pressure there maybe we start getting a little more requests for forgiveness is it the first quarter second quarter third quarter i mean we dont know today we earn a little less than off of the ppp loan and that is the rate plus a portion of the fees that we have to recognize on the effective interest method so it weighs on our margin which is why we carve it out for the analysis and weve given you the dollar amount now right at million so i dont know when that could happen but probably the middle of saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc right but just to be absolutely clear your guidance for the fourth quarter thats not assuming any acceleration in ppp fee income david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp thats correct saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc and okay all right and then if i could just pivot and ask you about your reserving and kind of go into the waterfall your acl waterfall i mean your reserve levels were flat and so essentially what you term as portfolio risk imbalances one for one offset chargeoffs and i guess an improved economic outlook and im just curious what that portfolio risk imbalances entails because in an environment where you had falling loans and its not clear that your mix became riskier and more tilted towards high loss content loans that effectively keeping reserves flat effectively means that youre reserving more on your back book and youre estimating higher loss content on your back book so im just curious if we should view that more as sort of a mindset where you dont think its appropriate yet to reduce reserves and note that i didnt use reserve releases but see falling reserves or is there something else and i guess the adjunct to that is what would make you confident enough to the point where you actually start to see falling acl levels and lower absolute dollar sort of levels barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp yeah that would be right now we theres a lot of uncertainty as we talked about already in the call relative to what we think whats going to happen in the economy we really dont know and so with that heightened level of uncertainty it doesnt give us a warm feeling that we should go ahead and start releasing reserves we just dont know its going to happen a lot of volatility that comes with uncertainty of course the two go handinhand and so we just dont think its prudent or appropriate at this point in the economic cycle that were in for us to go ahead and start releasing less or providing less so thats what the thinking is behind that david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 yeah and we do have production of new loans every quarter even though the gross number may not change we do have a production we do have some of our as you mentioned bad book we do have some that weve increased reserves on we have certain loans we look at loan by loan some wed look at portfolios and there are certain of those that we added to this particular quarter and as i said its just hard to tell what will happen next quarter we have to get to the end and see what the facts and circumstances are at that time saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc yeah i mean its just simply a function of you just feeling confident that the economy is on a more sound footing and at that point you would feel comfortable reducing reserves because effectively it almost seems like reducing reserves is almost calling the end of the credit cycle right now and so im just like curious if thats the way you look at it is it just really simply a function of having a more clear outlook on the glide path of the economy and feeling more strongly about it david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah to the extent you ignore the reduction in reserves that come through chargeoffs because thats a given the rest of it yeah reducing reserves after that wed have to have more clarity with regards to the economy and the performance of our portfolios over their remaining life of the loans thats exactly right saul martinez q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thanks operator your next question is from bill carcache of wolfe research john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp good morning bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc i wanted to ask about the return on tangible common equity trajectory when we pull all of the pieces together that youve all discussed on the call so putting up the lowest efficiency ratio in over a decade in this environment obviously stands out layering in the expense savings that you discussed from branch optimization and everything else and then the nii benefits from noninterest bearing deposit mix rising to the highest level weve seen at and it seems like we can kind of see your rotce continue to rise to alltime highs as we look ahead feels a little bit unusual to be talking about high rotces in a recession where we havent even seen losses rise yet i was hoping you could give a little bit of color around when we pull all the pieces together and think about rotce how you see that trajectory david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah i think if you were to look at generally commercial banking in this environment normalize provisioning for this environment it is a low rate environment so we think returns are in that to range you can get a given quarter that would be outside of those boundaries but if you kind of look all in we think thats a reasonable regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 return i think banks can earn their more than their cost of capital and generate shareholder value just not at the level we would have if we had a much higher steeper yield curve where we could have margins that are in that basis points to basis points range we talked about at our investor day some years ago that drove returns much higher than that to so i think thats probably where we are at the moment but were continuing to work hard to make it better and thats what our continuous improvements are all about bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood and following up on your earlier comments about a steepener and the benefits there can you give a little bit more color on your exposure to the short versus the long end of the curve and any sensitivities in terms of benefit to nii would be really helpful david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp along the short rates we really dont have any exposure there were pretty much mitigated there its the long and kind of the middle of the curve that pose most of the risk to us and again its because we have billion of cash flows coming out of our fixed rate loan and securities portfolios that we have to reinvest that caused the biggest challenge to us there and the front book back book if you want to call it that is about one point different difference between whats rolling off and what we can put it to work at in a reasonable way today thats where the risk is bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp okay operator do we have any more questions do we her on operator im sorry your final question is from jennifer demba of truist securities john m turner a president chief executive officer director regions financial corp okay great thank you morning david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp morning jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc good morning congratulations barb im going to miss working with you barbara i godin a senior executive vice president deputy chief risk officer and chief credit officer regions financial corp regions financial corp rf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 20oct2020 thank you so much jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc my question is on mortgage banking fees theyve obviously been at record levels for a couple of quarters what are you guys seeing in terms of production trends in the fourth quarter and beyond as this home buying frenzy continues david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp yeah so weve been very pleased we hit a record this quarter in terms of mortgage if you go back to a list of these earnings calls where we say mortgage is strong and it should be strong next quarter it got even stronger and really benefiting from the consumer banking groups decision to hire mortgage loan originators couple years ago in preparation for a low rate environment like we anticipated so were benefiting from that we think the fourth quarter based on whats in the pipeline is going to be strong whether it can be as strong as the third quarter dont yet know but we think its set up for a very strong and a big reason for that confidence is that as you know historically weve been a purchase shop and mainly to today our mix is about in terms of refinance and purchase both of them are strong refis wont continue forever we understand that but weve been a pretty strong purchase shop unlike others who had actually refi purchase so we think the fourth quarter will be good we think all of will be pretty good too whether we meet the levels were at right now dont know jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks very much david jackson turner a chief financial officer senior executive vp regions financial corp okay john m turner president chief executive officer director regions financial corp well i think thats the last call we had so really appreciate your interest and thank you for participating in the
