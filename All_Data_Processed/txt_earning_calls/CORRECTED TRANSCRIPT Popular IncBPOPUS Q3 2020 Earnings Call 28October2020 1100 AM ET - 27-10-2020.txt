unprecedented level of federal stimulus our strong results also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and prudent risk management please turn to slide for an update on the current business environment in puerto rico following a strict lockdown between midmarch and late may that helped curtail the initial spreads of pandemic many of the restrictions that were in place were gradually

down significantly compared to last year but have also begun to improve total nonfarm employment has increased by since april but remains below september level new auto sales have rebounded sharply and in the third quarter were up yearover year while demand for automobiles remains strong lack of inventory may impact sales going forward cement sales increased in the third quarter both sequentially and as compared to the yearago period debit and credit card sales increased by compared to the second quarter of and by versus last years third quarter yeartodate sales were up compared to similarly bpprs third quarter mortgage originations have rebounded increasing by compared to the third quarter of tourism is improving slowly but it continues to lag other areas of the local

our returntowork protocol to ensure a safe transition back to onpremise activities when possible which we currently plan will be no earlier than january during the quarter we paid a second special bonus to our branch employees in recognition of the unique challenges they face during this period were also focused on supporting our customers in this uncertain environment during the initial periods of the pandemic we offered payment relief to our retail and commercial customers and continue to work with those clients who still needs help with respect to the ppp program we have deployed an online platform for customers to request loan forgiveness of the total loans originate are below qualifying them for the simplified process we expect that the forgiveness process will be substantially completed through the fourth quarter of we continue to have more than million monthly active users on our mi banco digital platform in puerto rico we captured of deposits in the third quarter to digital channels yeartodate of our deposits have been captured digitally compared to in finally and most impressively given puerto ricos recent demographic trends our customer base continues to grow increasing by in the third quarter to million customers please turn to slide our quarterly net income of million was million higher than the second quarter and million higher than the same quarter last year third quarter results were driven by higher revenues and lower provision partially offset by higher operating expenses the increase in net interest income was driven by popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 an increase in our investment portfolio and lower deposit costs credit quality trends were solid in the quarter however we remain vigilant as the economic outlook is still uncertain in the quarter we completed a series of bulk mortgage repurchase transactions from our gse servicing portfolio totaling million these transactions along with a shift of a portion of our shortterm investments to agency mortgagebacked securities were excluded in order to deploy liquidity to increase interest income and improve our margins please turn to slide before turning it over to carlos i want to comment on a series of actions to realign our new york metro branch network as part of this realignment of our lower performing branches in the new york metro area will be closed we anticipate the closure of these locations to be completed by the end of january these actions will impact employees who will be receiving severance and transition assistance we remain committed to the new york metro market and will maintain our presence in most of the current communities providing ph critical accessibility to financial products and services that our customers rely on eight of the branches we are closing are within miles of another one of our branches we will continue to operate branches throughout the new york metro area our largest retail network in the mainland united states this difficult decision was made following a detailed review of our current network including foot traffic branch proximity customer needs and accessibility of supplemental services the branch realignment will allow us to reduce operating expenses leverage resources to focus on small and mediumsized businesses and enhance our digital offering to support changing customer behaviors as a result of these actions we expect to record a pretax charge of approximately million with million to be reflected in the fourth quarter of going forward we estimate annual savings will be million with an expected payback period of approximately two years we are confident that are our branch repositioning strategy will strengthen our operations in new york as we continue to meet the growing and diverse needs of our customers employees and the communities that we serve i will now turn the call over to carlos carlos j vázquez executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you ignacio good morning please turn to slide as usual additional information is provided in the appendix to the slide deck todays earnings press release details variances from the second quarter net interest income for the third quarter was million an increase of million from the second quarter noninterest income increased by million to million in q3 driven by the reinstatement during the quarter of certain service charges and late fees which were waived in q2 as part of our response to the pandemic deposit service charges were higher by million mainly in puerto rico due to higher transaction volumes and other service fees were also higher by million as customer activity increased debit and credit card fees by million in addition there was a positive adjustment of million to indemnity reserves on previously sold loans mainly due to reserve releases related to the mortgage loan repurchases these items were partially offset by a lower mortgage banking income by million primarily driven by a negative msr adjustment and the impact of the bulk loan repurchases popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 while not yet there we continue to move towards our historical normalized noninterest income run rate of million to million per quarter in the short term we may settle at slightly lower quarterly levels as high deposit bonds has continued to reduce some depositrelated fees provision expense for the quarter was million which is million lower than in q2 lidio will expand later total operating expenses were million million higher than the prior quarter as client activity increased during the quarter we saw a corresponding increase in associated costs we had higher volumerelated expenses in two categories processing and technology by million as well as card processing and interchange by million equipment expenses increased by million mainly due to higher amortization expense we also had an increase in reserves for operational losses of million and a higher provision for unused commitments by million these increases were partially offset by lower audit and tax fees as well as lower writedowns of foreclosed auto and personnel cost was decreased by million due to lower comp expense partially offset by higher productionrelated commissions and bonuses in the first quarter we announced that in response to lower interest rates and the effect of the pandemic we implemented various costsaving initiatives we now expect to exceed the targeted million in savings during and project our average quarterly expenses for the year to be around million lower than our prior guidance of million per quarter and lower than our original expense guidance for the year of million per quarter in q4 we are forecasting operating expenses of approximately million excluding the costs associated with the branch actions announced today our effective tax rate for the quarter was in q4 we expect our effective tax rate to be between and please turn to slide before i move to net interest income and margin dynamics id like to discuss in more detail the bulk mortgage repurchase transactions that were completed in q3 delinquencies and deferrals have increased then population of serviced loans eligible for repurchase in q3 we executed million of bulk mortgage repurchases from our gse loan servicing portfolios in order to limit future servicing advances and sundry losses and to increase interest income these transactions resulted in a net expense of million during the quarter the impact is reflected in various lines of our income statement as noted in the slide the most significant portion of the charge is related to the msr asset as well as interest payments we had advanced to the gnma pools that we do not expect to collect under the fha guaranty these expenses were offset by servicing income for these loans and the release of the indemnity recourse reserve for the acquired fannie mae loans based on the net yield of for the repurchased assets we expect to recover the expense in less than six months through net interest income please turn to slide the net interest income for the quarter was million an increase of million from q2 the three primary drivers of this increase were increased balances in the investment portfolio primarily driven by higher levels of deposits in puerto rico income recognized from loans issued under the ppp program by million million higher than q2 and lower deposit costs primarily at popular bank we saw deposit growth of billion in the quarter this increase was once again across all client segments in puerto rico but in q3 it was led by retail and commercial deposits not public deposits about million of this increase was related to our bulk mortgage repurchases and left the bank early in the fourth quarter nim decreased by basis points to in q3 on a taxable equivalent basis net interest margin was a decrease of basis points loan yields and deposit costs dropped by similar amounts basis points and popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 basis points respectively just like in q2 the lower nim is related to asset mix the increase in average deposits which are invested mostly in overnight fed funds and shortterm us treasuries and higher average balances in ppp loans of billion compared to million in q2 for the fourth quarter nim will be impacted by the pace at which ppp loans are forgiven and also by additional changes in our asset mix the remaining unamortized portion of the fees related to ppp loans is approximately million as of the end of the third quarter puerto rico public deposits were roughly billion about million higher than in q2 we continue to expect public deposits to come down over the mid to long term under the cares act for example assistance funds provided to the commonwealth of puerto rico must be used by yearend however the potential for assistance additional covidrelated federal assistance could increase balances in the near term our average loan balances increased slightly in the quarter growing by million this growth was primarily driven by lower yielding ppp loans partially offset by lower levels of higher yielding consumer balances at bppr ph ending balances also increased by a portion of the mortgage repurchases completed at the end of the quarter in q3 we continue to see strong demand in mortgage and auto loans and leases while balances in our personal loan and credit card portfolios continue to show net prepayments economic health and business uncertainties make it difficult to predict loan balances for the fourth quarter and onwards we expect loan balances to move lower due to ppp forgiveness as well as limited demand fueled by unprecedented levels of clients liquidity please turn to slide our capital levels remained strong relative to mainland peers as well as with respect to wellcapitalized regulatory requirements our common equity tier ratio in q3 was up basis points from q2 tangible book value increased by per share to this increase was driven by our quarterly net income offset somewhat by dividend payments in this slide we repeat an update a calculation of our pro forma capital ratios applying the loss ratio of our last published dfast severely adverse stress test from in this simulation we still end up with a very strong cet1 ratio of this calculation is a pointintime estimate not a fullblown stress test so it does not include the nine quarters or future ppnr that is typical on a full stress test for the third quarter our allowance for credit losses represents of this dfast loss estimate our return on average tangible equity was we will continue to pursue our target of doubledigit return on tangible equity as discussed last quarter we expect to engage with our regulators about our capital plan early next year and continue to target being able to make capitalrelated announcement in april of with that i turn the call over to lidio lidio v soriano chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc thank you carlos and good morning overall our credit performance remained stable during the third quarter of aided by payment deferrals government stimulus and the resumption of collection efforts given current uncertainties were monitoring the impact of the pandemic on our entire loan portfolio yet certain commercial segments are more sensitive are highlighted on slide number popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 within the cre nonretail segment the exposure in puerto rico is mainly comprised of office space while the exposure in the us is mainly multifamily the average original loantovalue in puerto rico is while in the us is office space and multifamily occupancy and collection have remained stable through the pandemic todate there have been a moderate number of downgrades in these segments the utilization deferrals mainly relates to consumer strategy to strengthen liquidity of the customers that have exited relief of accounts are current in the healthcare facilities segment our puerto rico exposure is mainly to hospitals while our us exposure is to skilled nursing facilities for both regions federal and local assistance have supported the industry operations today there have been a limited number of deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio within nonessential retail the shelterinplace orders curtailed activity of this segment as a result we have experienced a significant number of deferrals and downgrades most within ph dfastrated category of the customers that have exited deferrals of accounts are current the average original loanto value for this segment is in general based on borrower surveys conducted in the second quarter occupancy has remained stable compared to precovid levels strip malls reported an occupancy and collection rate while shopping centers reported an occupancy and a collection rate regarding auto retail in puerto rico this activity was subject to the lockdown order and sales decreased significantly in the second quarter upon the authorization to resume sales the segment reported strong sales during the third quarter regarding the construction segment most of our exposure is in the us and principally in the new york metro region the majority of our projects are in late stage of completion have low loantocost and average original loantovalue of and nominal exposure to highend residential todate there have been a limited number of deferral requests and downgrades in this portfolio during the quarter inflows of npls increased by million driven by two relationships one in puerto rico and one in new york both relationships exhibited difficulties prior to the covid crisis and the risk profile continue to deteriorate which prompted our decision to place them in nonaccrual status our hotel exposure is mostly in puerto rico at the end of the quarter our total exposure stood at million with an average of original loantovalue of this segment has experienced elevated levels of stress due to limited business and leisure travel most of the original deferrals expire in the third quarter but given the challenges of the industry we foresee additional extensions to support our borrowers during the quarter we downgraded million of accounts in this segment after having downgraded million in the second quarter restaurant balances were ph million at quarter end this segment has experienced stress given by the shelterinplace order the majority of our restaurant borrowers particularly quickservice or fast food continue to operate to delivery and carryout in the governors latest lockdown order restaurants can operate at capacity once the economy fully reopens we expect this segment to rebound at a faster pace especially the quickservice restaurants of the customers that have exited deferrals of accounts are current todate this segment has had a significant number of deferrals and downgrades most within dfast category to finalize let me also discuss the segment to which we are not exposed to we do not have a material credit exposure to energy airlines or shared national credits turning to slide number we have provided relief to our customer through loan modification consisting of deferrals forbearance or extensions we granted assistance to approximately customer accounts popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 representing billion of loans and of total balances of customers have exited relief and approximately of these accounts remain current although encouraged by these trends most of the deferrals which ended in the third quarter impacted delinquency levels favorably we remain attentive to delinquency trends and expect their visibility next quarter please turn to page number to discuss credit metrics nonperforming assets decreased by million to million mainly driven by an npl decrease of million coupled with another decrease of million the npl decrease was driven by reduction of million in puerto rico due to lower mortgage by million ph oreo by million and commercial by million offset in part by the million construction npl inflow previously mentioned in the us npls increased by million driven by the million construction relationship mentioned earlier the oreo decrease was driven by the resumption of sales activity and the suspension of foreclosure activity at the end of the quarter the ratio of npls to total loans was compared to in the previous quarter please turn to slide number to discuss npl inflows compared to the second quarter npl inflows excluding consumer loans increased by million driven by an increase of million in the us due to the previously mentioned construction loan coupled with an million relationship that mature and reach days while in the renewal process the loan renewal was completed during the quarter and the loan was returned to accrual status before the quarter ended the increase was offset in part by a decrease of million in puerto rico driven by a decrease of million in mortgage offset in part by an increase in the commercial construction inflows of million due to a construction relationship mentioned earlier turning to slide number net chargeoff amounted to million or an annualized basis points compared to million or basis points in the previous quarter in puerto rico net chargeoff decreased by million mainly due to lower consumer by million mostly related to auto loans the governments stimulus deferrals granted and the resumption of collection activity has had a significant impact in the delinquency of our portfolios about of our credit clients in puerto rico also have deposit relationships at the bank on average these clients have increased their liquidity by since the pandemic began we do not expect to see changes in net chargeoff onto the first half of next year everything else being equal given the cecl methodology net charge offs are already are reflected in our reserve and thus the pl impact has been accounted for the corporation allowance for credit losses increased slightly by million to million driven mainly by an increase in the us cre portfolio the ratio of allowance for credit losses to loans held in portfolio remained flat at in the third quarter the ratio of allowance for credit losses to npls was compared to in the prior quarter the provision for credit losses decreased by million to million due to significantly lower net chargeoffs the provision to net chargeoff ratio was compared to in the previous quarter please turn to slide to discuss the allowance for credit losses we adopted cecl on january since the adoption our allowance for credit losses related to loans has increased by million or driven by the day one adoption impact changes to macroeconomic scenarios and loan portfolio changes at the end of the third quarter the allowance for credit losses increased by million compared to the prior quarter variances were driven by economic outlook changes to portfolio balances and portfolio credit quality while we used single economic scenarios in q1 and q2 given that one economic outlook is inherently uncertain we enhanced our process for the third quarter and introduced probability weights of different scenarios in our estimation we combined moodys analytics septembers s1 optimistic baseline and s3 pessimistic scenarios probability weights were applied to each scenario output as part of the acl estimation process when compared popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 to the second quarter baseline scenario the third quarter baseline assumes a more favorable increase in economic activity from the first quarter of to the second quarter of with continued growth thereafter among the three scenarios using the acl the baseline scenario is assigned the highest probability followed by the s3 scenario given the uncertainties in the economic outlook and downside risk the s1 scenario is considered but carries a lowest weight the implementation of probability weight and changes in macroeconomic scenarios caused the acl to increase by million this increase was offset in part by the net chargeoff activity and portfolio changes to summarize our loan portfolio attributed stable credit quality metrics during the third quarter aided by the payment deferrals governments stimulus and the resumption of collection efforts however as the effects of the pandemic continue to evolve and remain fluid the full extent of the economic disruption is uncertain we will continue to carefully monitor the exposure of the portfolios to pandemicrelated risk changes in the economic outlook and how delinquencies and net chargeoffs evolve over the next few quarters with that i would like to turn the call over to ignacio for his concluding remarks thank you ignacio alvarez president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you lidio and carlos for your updates while the economic scenario remains uncertain we generated million earnings in the third quarter reflecting the economic rebound fueled by the unprecedented level of federal stimulus our strong results also reflect our diversified sources of revenue and our prudent risk management deposits continue to grow and our capital liquidity levels are robust we are wellpositioned to continue to serve our customers as they manage through these uncertain times this month marks populars 127th anniversary and despite the current challenges we have much to celebrate we are blessed to be part of a team of talented and dedicated colleagues who have met the current challenges with courage and resilience we have a loyal customer base that continues to grow and we are an integral part of the communities we serve this commitment was recognized earlier in the month by the american bankers association which selected us as one of only seven banks nationwide to receive the community commitment award for our financial education program we are very proud of this achievement for all these reasons we look forward to the future with a renewed sense of purpose and optimism were now ready to answer your questions popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 question and answer section operator well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions the first question is from alex twerdahl from piper sandler please go ahead alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co morning guys ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co first off i wanted to circle back to something you said lidio in your prepared remarks i think you said that you didnt expect net chargeoffs the level of net chargeoffs to change meaningfully into the middle of next year i was wondering one if i heard that correctly and two if based on the loans that are coming off deferral and collection efforts and things like that what gives you the confidence that the chargeoff levels will remain low and if we should extrapolate that into progression of the provision over the next couple of quarters as well lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc i mentioned indiscernible meaningful i mentioned change we expect changes to net chargeoff in the first half of next year everything else being equal i think we had a significant high level of chargeoffs in the second quarter and significantly low level of chargeoffs in the third quarter so you can try to use those as guidepost onto the first half of next year alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then i noticed the mortgage activities that mortgage activity was pretty strong and seen some reports recently on highend real estate in puerto rico rebounding pretty meaningfully yearoveryear i was wondering if you can give us some commentary on what youre seeing in the housing market just in general in puerto rico if it is rebounding and strong the way we see stateside ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes this is ignacio yes in general it is rebounding i mean obviously youve read about the highend dorado and bahia i mean clearly theyre very strong but we have seen a recovery across many of the different areas and especially in the metropolitan area so generally were seeing demand up for housing there hasnt been a popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 lot of supply new supply in the recent years so it is increasing weve seen it in our operations the originations are way up applications are way up ph weve seen oreo sales so were definitely seeing improvement in the residential market especially in the metro area and especially in the middle and higher income neighborhoods but really across the board but i would say mostly the metropolitan area alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co all right thats helpful and then just a final question for me just carlos as you think about the moving parts in nii obviously the nim is going to be pretty volatile with ppp forgiveness over the next couple of quarters but when i look at your margin and i look at the amount of cash and liquidity on the balance sheet and then i sort of pair that against some time deposits that still seem like theyre paying rates that are much higher than youd expect given the rate environment does that represent a pretty big opportunity over the next couple of quarters for the cost of deposits to continue coming lower and providing all the more juice to nii carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean when you look at the margin actually this quarter was not too different from last quarter in that almost the totality or the vast majority of our reduction in margin was really linked to asset mix as opposed to rates or anything else with respect to deposit costs we have just two answers to that question alex when you look at puerto rico we have interestbearing deposit costs of basis points total deposit costs of basis points thats our bestin class and while theres always room and we will continue to look at opportunities there is not immense amount of room to continue to lower deposit costs in puerto rico we have had more room in the states and thats where a lot of the deposit costs drop happened this quarter we dropped around basis points in total cost deposit costs in the us this quarter so we will continue to pursue the effort in the us so is there opportunity yes but the opportunity is larger in our smaller deposit book which is the one in the states alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just a final question for me during the quarter there were some rumors that evertec was potentially exploring the sale and thats obviously a pretty big ph realized gain on your balance sheet if that were to happen would that change the ability to return capital for you guys in or the amount of capital you could return lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc yeah one i wouldnt want to speculate whats going to happen with evertec but obviously if we have more capital that would come into our capital plan and well look at it i wouldnt necessarily assume that any onetime capital ph shot we get from any sort that the fed will necessarily let us distribute it out immediately so thats about all i think we could say on that ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 alexander roberts huxley twerdahl q analyst piper sandler co well thank you for taking my questions ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks alex operator the next question comes from brock vandervliet from usb sic ubs please go ahead brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thank you ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hey brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc hey just a big picture question first anything new in terms of population growth trends on the island ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no we havent seen anything the most recent migration trends show that the number of people leaving the island had decreased dramatically i dont know how much that is tied to the pandemic obviously ph if foot traffic together with that definitely people to the extent that economic opportunities in the states arent great right now ph its less than incentive for people to leave and also the federal stimulus was very generous so its natural to see why that decreased those statistics lag a little bit and there hasnt been much movement on new birth which is obviously something thats very important too our birth rate has gone down as in many parts of the world but that is something we havent been able to change very much so i think in general the positive less migration but still the birth rate is generally low lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc and despite the sort of flat by the way compared to the last years a flat population is pretty good for us but its always important to not forget that even though we have a flat roughly a flat population rate probably for the last yearandahalf or two we continued to grow our clients ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah and i think one thing that people dont realize is that even with a flat population scenario home households do increase obviously not at the same rates so independent households children go out and buy their own homes and were seeing that in puerto rico weve talked about it earlier there is a healthy demand now for mortgages but in as opposed to in the states or maybe a refinance in puerto rico its still about popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 so theres a strong demand for homes there hasnt been a lot of supply so even if the households increase slowly thats creating a good momentum for the households for the housing sector brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay and shifting over to the loan book if you could just remind me what your total construction book is and the mix between puerto rico and the us and average loan to cost carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc our total loan book is million of which the majority is in the us million is in the usa so the rest will be in puerto rico loan to costs i mean i didnt provide that in sort of my prepared remarks but it will be in the ph starts with a thereabout brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc got it okay thank you thanks for the color ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thank you operator the next question comes from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning gentlemen ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc hello how are you gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good can you give us an update i think the trump administration came out in september and announced a billion aid package for puerto rico from hurricane maria is that money in addition to what was promised puerto rico when the hurricane hit about three years ago or is this just part of that original plan and how do you see the money flowing into the economy ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc no that was actually part of the original plan i mean the numbers we have right now basically for hurricane relief is about billion was allocated and about billion has been dispersed so the difference is there to be dispersed also independent of the hurricane relief we have the cares act relief for the covid which was about billion and this is these estimates are now as strong as the first ones ph you can get it from the popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 website but we estimate about billion of indiscernible so theres about billion that number you heard is about billion of federal aid left to be spent now i believe i dont believe that the pace is picking up as you saw they reached an agreement with the federal government for the restoration of the electrical system which was the single biggest ticket item out there and its progressing albeit slowly but its progressing faster than it was these monies especially the hurricane relief money will not be spent in a year two years three years even four years i mean it may take years to spend this money so itll be there for a while the covid relief is a bit different a lot of that was supposed to be spent by december so well see what happens with that ph weve got a little rush to spend it or lose some of it or it gets extended so thats obviously theres a lot of money to be spent there in that x if theres a federal stimulus package for the whole country and if we get treated more or less equal to the states as we were in the last one we can expect therell be a lot more money coming in the way also gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc and could you quickly whats the gross state product of puerto rico just to put it in context because obviously its an enormous amount of money that will put a support in the economy over a multiyear period do you have about what the gross state product is of puerto rico ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yeah the gross domestic product includes pharmaceuticals and that is about billion gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great okay and you mentioned in your prepared remarks that cement sales were quite strong ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you kind of share with us is it more due to federal programs like were talking about now or is it more in the private sector and is it more commercial versus consumerrelated ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc i think theres a little i want to give you a sort of a political answer its a little bit of everything there are obviously some of the fema money is beginning to come out for infrastructure projects and municipal projects but youre also seeing an immense amount of home improvement in puerto rico as you are in the states as peoples liquidity went up and they couldnt travel people are fixing up their homes theyre building pools theyre doing things that require cement popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 so and youre seeing buildings being rebuilt after the hurricanes some from insurance indiscernible came out a year ago so for example the ritz hotel in isla verde has just announced that they had settled with the insurance companies not too many months ago and havent even begun to rebuild so we really have a little bit of everything its just not government there is a lot of ph competitors and a lot of home rebuilding going on in puerto rico right now home improvement gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then shifting over to your comments about the branch closures in the five boroughs of new york can you share with us did the covid problem accelerate plans to close these branches and what metrics do you use to determine to close these branches or is it foot traffic i know you mentioned a lower profitability but what metrics were you guys focused on and could you use any of this type of an analysis in either florida or even in even on the island in puerto rico ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc yes gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc just to make it more efficient ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well we looked at a number of metrics like you said foot traffic the level of deposits profitability sales in those branches we looked at all of those and basically these were our most underperforming branches so we really in the end we felt that they probably subtracted more than they added to the retail or the strength of the retail franchise and so it was a very detailed analysis we do this kind of analysis for all of our branches we dont see in florida we have only branches and all of our branches in florida are profitable so we dont really see much there and in puerto rico the same thing i mean in puerto rico we our branches are our source of strength they are large deposit gatherers but even more importantly theyre large centers of sales for our consumer loan products people dont recognize that the percentage of branches in puerto rico compared to the united states is much lower in the united states the most recent numbers that i saw is that we have branches for every inhabitants in puerto rico that number is in puerto rico since with the consolidation the population of puerto rico has decreased by the number of branches has decreased by so our branches still in puerto rico have a lot of transactional activity theyre sales generators and theyre very low cost to operate compared to the new york market our real estate costs here are very low and even our personnel costs are lower thats ph something were always looking and maybe there could be a handful of branches down the road that we could close but we are looking at the same metrics but they just pan out differently in both puerto rico and florida gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great and just final question carlos i think in your prepared remarks you touched on the capital action plans will be addressed in the spring of right now as we all know the federal reserve for the largest banks has popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 suspended the share repurchase programs through the end of the year if that suspension remains in place through lets say june of next year would that influence your guidance decision on your capital action plans of doing another buyback for example carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc well i mean were going to by the end of the year when the fed comments on the ccar resubmission of the largest banks were going to get a lot more information on how the fed is thinking about banks and capital plans and dividends and share repurchases so well add that to our analysis and how we structure our discussions with them there are increasingly there is a while the restriction is there and very clear for the largest banks theres an increasing number of banks smaller banks that have reinstituted their buybacks i mean increasing number of banks over billion in the beginning they were all under billion in assets now significant number of banks over billion are securing it and while the fed has been very clear that they want to be conservative on bank capital theyve also stated the intent to continue to make the ph case decisions on a bankbybank basis so at the end of the day no banks in our asset range that i know of have tested that intent and with the information well gain between now and yearend well try to make an intelligent judgment of what makes sense obviously we have a very strong capital position and that starting point will be reflected in our discussions with them gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you everyone carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thank you operator operator instructions the next question comes from glen manna from keefe bruyette and woods please go ahead glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hi good morning ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc good morning glen carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc good morning lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc good morning popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc we heard anecdotally from a bank on the mainland that the sba had hired about people to work on the loan forgiveness program which i guess given the size of the program theyre going to be really busy so what gives you confidence that the bulk of the forgiveness process will be substantially completed by ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc well basically this is our best estimate or guess based on our consultations with our clients many of our clients are eager to get this done now thats not a guarantee this is a new process weve put in a portal ph with the help perhaps the sba can process these things but basically based mostly on our conversations with clients and their desire to get this thing wrapped up as quickly as possible glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and i guess regardless of the timing i would assume that you guys would be getting a pretty big check from the federal government from all these loan forgivenesses and that would kind of increase your excess liquidity would you have any plans for kind of deploying that would you put it into the securities book or would you kind of i know some of the excess liquidities have been kept short term related to the government deposits but is this something that you might feel a little bit more comfortable kind of extending duration on ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc carlos can you answer that carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean we have already done some of that glen and its a little bit lost because youre looking at variances in our investment portfolio in a more aggregate level but we have already moved some of the cash and the investments we had in shorterterm treasuries to longer duration agency mbss thats about we shifted about billion that way in the third quarter were always in our weekly alco committee we continue to reassess we should extend more of our cash and that decisions are made dynamically but the answer to your question weve done some of it already and we will continue to reassess if we should do more moving forward and we have to be attentive as we mentioned as ignacio mentioned first the government of puerto rico has a lot of money in their accounts related to the cares act and again theoretically if that is not used by yearend it is supposed to be given back some way now the congress may legislate to extend that a lot of things may change between now and then but there could be significant outflows that happen and we have to be attentive as well but bottom line yes we dynamically we assess our investment portfolio yes we actually have extended maturity already during the third quarter for significant amount and we will continue to considerate it in the fourth quarter glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 okay great thanks and just remind me again where we have the possibility of a change of administrations here on the mainland and one of the candidates plan could be an increase in the corporate tax rate and just remind me again that increase in the rate would only be applicable to your mainlandsourced income carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah that is correct what you have to keep an eye on is that our legislators in puerto rico tend to be a little bit of copycats so sometimes when the rates go up in the states they want to follow suit but as it stands now that is correct the change in federal taxes will affect only the income our us based mainland usbased income lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc keep in mind that our corporate tax rates in puerto rico are higher so i dont think theyll go down that road here ph not sure glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i would hope not it would almost get confiscatory at some point over lidio v soriano a chief risk officer executive vice president popular inc we have higher rates over here in puerto rico so glen manna q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay thank you for taking my questions ignacio alvarez a president chief executive officer director popular inc thanks glen operator the next question is a followup from gerard cassidy from rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you one last question carlos on your slide which is really helpful in looking at capital relative to dfast losses do you guys have an idea when you might update the dfast number to a more updated number carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc yeah i mean the we referred to that one simply because its the last one we published gerard we actually have done dfast stress severely adverse stress test every year since its just that we havent published it and were in the process of doing it right now for this year as well since were not required to publish this we popular inc bpop corrected transcript q3 earnings call 28oct2020 havent published it but one of the reasons we felt okay with using this number is that while we havent published details on the later ones theyre in the right ballpark so you can use that number with some level of comfort gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good okay thank you carlos j vázquez a executive vice president chief financial officer popular inc thanks operator there are no
