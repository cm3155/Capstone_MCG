director discover financial services thanks eric and thanks to our listeners for joining todays call last april if you told me that a year into the pandemic wed be reporting excellent credit performance positive sales trends and solid earnings growth i wouldnt have believed it while the pandemic is far from over and there may be twists and turns ahead as a nation we have made tremendous progress toward addressing the health crisis and reopening the economy this quarter we earned billion after tax or per share im very pleased with these results which reflect our robust business model strong execution including a disciplined approach to managing credit improving economic trends and the impact of federal support for us consumers since the end of our view on economic conditions has improved the rapid pace of the recovery has lessened our concern of job losses spreading to the whitecollar workforce and there has also been substantial support for the us consumer through stimulus in january and in march our current expectation is that credit losses in will be flat to down yearoveryear this improved economic view combined with lower loan balances and continued strong credit performance were the primary drivers of the million reserve release in the quarter as discussed in previous quarters the strong credit performance was accompanied by elevated payment rates that continue to put pressure on loan discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 balances which were down yearoveryear payment rates were over basis points higher than last year and at their highest level since the year while the impact from stimulus payments should abate over the next few months we expect payment rates will remain elevated for the rest of the year as households use savings to meet debt obligations and continue to benefit from payment relief programs such as federal student loan and mortgage payment forbearance despite this pressure we still expect modest loan growth this year supported by several factors first there has been a significant increase in sales volume up from a year ago and up from the first quarter of improving trends in categories like retail and restaurants are positive signs for future growth additionally based on our credit performance and our current outlook for macro conditions we have begun to migrate our credit standards back to prepandemic levels this is particularly true in card where our value proposition centered on bestinclass customer service valuable rewards and no fees continues to resonate strongly among consumers were also expanding credit standards in personal loans but not quite back to norms to offset the higher payment rate as well as leverage these credit actions we intend to increase our marketing spending through the rest of this year outside of marketing we expect that expenses will be relatively flat year overyear as we remain committed to expense management were reinvesting some of the benefits from our strong credit performance and efficiency gains into technology and analytics to further improve our account acquisition targeting fraud detection and collections capabilities the rapid pace of the economic recovery and strong credit performance may provide additional opportunities to lean further into growth we intend to take advantage of these opportunities and may make additional marketing and nonmarketing investments that will create longterm value on the payment side we continued strong performance in our pulse business with volumes up driven by stimulus payments in the first quarter and higher average spend per transaction we also continue to expand our global acceptance through network partnerships and this quarter we signed new partners in jordan and malaysia our digital banking model generates high returns and we remain committed to returning capital to our shareholders this quarter we restarted our share repurchase program with million in buybacks in line with the regulatory restrictions still in place looking at our strong credit performance and robust earnings we see an opportunity to revisit our capital return to shareholders in the second half of the year as i look towards the future im excited about discovers prospects our products continue to bring value to our customers we remain flexible as we support our employees and their families through the pandemic and we are well positioned to continue driving longterm value for our shareholders before i turn it over to john one last thing you may not know it but our clo wanji walcott sits in on these calls and is a great part of the team today is her birthday so i want to wish wanji a very happy birthday with that ill now ask john to discuss key aspects of our financial results in more detail john t greene chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 thank you roger happy birthday wanji and good morning everyone ill begin by addressing our summary financial results on slide as roger indicated the results this period reflects many of the same dynamics weve seen over the past few quarters the influence of stimulus resulted in elevated payment rates which pressured loan growth it also contributed to the strong asset quality and our significant reserve release in the quarter revenue net of interest expense decreased from the prior year mainly from lower net interest income this was driven by a decline in average receivables and lower market rates partially offset by a reduction in funding costs as we continued to manage deposit pricing and optimize our funding mix noninterest income was lower primarily due to a million net gain from the sale of an equity investment in the prior year consistent with our excellent credit quality lower loan fee income reflects the decline in late fees while net discount and interchange revenue was up from the prior year reflecting the increased sales volume the provision for credit losses was billion lower than the prior year mainly due to an million reserve release in the current quarter compared to a billion reserve build in the prior year our improved economic outlook lower loan balances and strong credit ph drove the release additionally net chargeoffs decreased or million from the prior year operating expenses decreased yearoveryear as we remained disciplined on expense management other than compensation all other expenses were down from the prior year led by marketing which decreased yearoveryear looking ahead we intend to accelerate marketing investments over the remainder of the year well go into details on our spending outlook in a few moments moving to loan growth on slide total loans were down from the prior year driven by a decrease in card receivables the reduction in card receivables was driven by two primary factors first the payment rate remains elevated driven by the latest round of stimulus and improved household cash flows second promotional balances have continued to decline reflecting the actions we took at the onset of the pandemic to tighten credit as a result these balances were approximately basis points lower than the prior year although we expect new account growth will cause promotional balances to begin to stabilize as the economy reopens further we believe consumer spending and prudent expansion of our credit box should drive profitable loan growth going forward looking at our other lending products organic student loans increased from the prior year and originations returned to prepandemic levels we continued to gain market share through the ph many peak seasons personal loans were down primarily due to actions we took early in the pandemic to minimize credit loss as weve previously mentioned we see opportunity to expand credit a bit given the strong performance of this portfolio moving to slide the net interest margin was up basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially compared to the prior quarter the improvement in net interest margin was driven by lower deposit pricing as we cut our online savings rates from basis points to basis points during the quarter we also continue to benefit from the maturity of higher rate cds and a favorable shift in funding mix our funding from consumer deposits is now at discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 future deposit pricing actions will be dependent upon our funding needs and competitor pricing average consumer deposits were up yearoveryear and flat to the prior quarter consumer cds were down from the prior quarter while savings and money markets increased loan yield was flat to the prior year seasonal revolve rate favorability and a lower mix of promotional rate balances were offset by the impact of reduced pricing on personal loans looking at slide total noninterest income was million down million or yearoveryear driven by the onetime gain in the prior year that i previously mentioned excluding this noninterest income was up net discount and interchange revenue increased as revenue from higher sales volume was partially offset by higher rewards cost the decrease in loan fee income was driven by lower late fees which move in line with delinquency trends looking at slide total operating expenses are down million or from the prior year marketing and business development decreased million or yearoveryear the reduction reflects actions we implemented in march of last year to align marketing spend with tightened credit criteria however we accelerated our marketing spend late in the first quarter and plan to continue this through the year these investments will drive new account acquisition and loan growth the yearoveryear decrease in other expenses was mainly driven by lower fraud volume due to enhanced analytics around disputed transactions and decreased fraud in deposits this improvement demonstrates a small part of the benefit we expect from the investments weve made in analytics over the past few years partially offsetting the favorability was a million increase in employment compensation that was driven by two factors million from a higher bonus accrual in the current year the remaining increase was driven by higher average salaries reflecting talent build in our technology and analytics team moving to slide we had another strong quarter of very strong credit performance the total chargeoffs were down basis points yearoveryear and up basis points sequentially the card net chargeoff rate was basis points lower than the prior year with the net chargeoffs dollars down million or sequentially the card net chargeoff rate increased basis points and net chargeoff dollars were up million the increase in card net chargeoffs from the prior quarter was driven by accounts that have been in skipapay and did not cure the program ended six months ago and at this time most of the accounts that were in skipa pay have returned to making payments looking forward we expect minimal impacts to chargeoffs from this population the card 30plus delinquency rate was down basis points from the prior year and basis points lower sequentially with the influence of the skipapay group now largely complete we think that delinquencies are the most clear indicator of our loss trajectory over the short term credit remains strong in private student loans net chargeoffs were down basis points yearoveryear and basis points compared to the prior quarter the 30plus delinquency rate improved basis points from the prior year and basis points sequentially in personal loans net chargeoffs were down basis points yearover year with a 30plus delinquency rate down basis points from the prior year and basis points from the prior quarter the positive impact of additional stimulus combined with an improved economic outlook have shifted our expectation on the timing of losses we had previously expected losses will increase in the second half of this discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 year and remain elevated into that is no longer the case based on our current delinquency trends we believe the losses are likely to be flat to down this year with the possibility of some increase in that said a material shift in the economic environment could alter the timing and magnitude of losses moving to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we released million from the allowance this reflected several factors including favorable changes to our macro assumptions a moderate decrease in our loan balance a continued decline in delinquencies and lower losses relative to our view in january the economic outlook has continued to improve as weve done in prior quarters weve modeled several different scenarios and took a conservative but more optimistic view our assumptions on unemployment were at year end rate of with a return to full employment in late we assume gdp growth of about our reserve assumptions did not contemplate any additional stimulus direct to consumers but did anticipate broader economic benefits from infrastructure spending beginning in the second half of this year the modest increase to reserves in our student loan portfolio was driven by loan growth coming out of the ph many peak seasons looking at slide our common equity tier ratio increased basis points sequentially to well above our internal target of we have continued to fund our quarterly dividend at per share and repurchased million of common stock during the quarter our board of directors previously authorized up to billion of repurchases we will likely accelerate our share repurchases in the second quarter and we see the potential for capital returns to increase in the second half of the year as i mentioned earlier we continue to optimize our funding mix and consumer deposits now make up of total funding our goal remains to have to of our funding from deposits which we feel is achievable though we expect some quartertoquarter variability in this figure moving to slide our perspectives on have evolved from last quarter we continue to anticipate modest positive loan growth for the year we are investing in new account acquisition and have already seen strong sales growth through the first quarter high payment rates will continue to pressure loan growth near term but should become less of a headwind over the course of the year versus the first quarter level we expect our nim to remain in a relatively narrow range over the rest of the year while well continue to benefit from improved funding cost and mix we may experience modest yield pressure over the next few quarters from variability in the revolve rate our commitment to expense management has not changed but as roger mentioned we believe there is an opportunity to drive longterm growth through increased marketing and further investments in data and analytics excluding marketing expenses should be near flat from the prior year credit performance has remained stronger than originally anticipated and we now expect credit losses to be flat to down compared to lastly we remain committed to returning capital to shareholders through dividend and buybacks given the level of reserve release and the strength of our fundamental performance we plan to revisit our capital plan capital return levels for the second half of this year in summary were pleased with our first quarter results our sales trend credit expansion and marketing investments position us well for growth going forward we released million of reserves nim continue to improve driven by lower funding costs and expenses were down but well invest in marketing and analytics that will drive revenue as well as operating and credit cost improvements over the longer term discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 as the economy reopens im positive regarding the opportunities for growth we have a strong value proposition that resonates with our consumers and our digital banking model positions us well for strong returns going forward with that ill turn the call back to our operator maria to open the line for qa question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions we will take our first question from sanjay sakhrani of kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning have a question on loan growth and marketing roger you talked about moving standards to prepandemic levels maybe you can just talk about the opportunities for growth relative to and how we should think about the marketing budget in relation to that and then maybe you could just also tie in your confidence level on the loan growth given the stimulus i mean it seems like you guys have kept it flat in terms of loan growth expectations so maybe just elaborate on that thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure thanks for the question sanjay maybe starting then with the stimulus clearly one of the biggest differences versus is the payment rate and thats partly driven by the cash payments to consumers the savings rate but also the relief they get be it on their federal student loans or other payments they have to make and so thats a real headwind against loan growth and as i mentioned on the call its actually at the highest level since the year in terms of marketing we feel very good about the cost per accounts about the projected returns well get on those have widened our credit box ph back to prepandemic although as you recall we had been tightening for a couple years and i would say continue to remain conservative in our overall credit approach so i really think its a headwind from payment rates that has kept us from being even more enthusiastic about loan growth sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc and when we think about the marketing amount relative to is there any context you could provide for that sorry for the followup roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah i think part of it and john indicated this i think were probably more comfortable giving you some view around where we expect total expenses to be but also it will depend on what we see in the back half of the year and so to the extent we see opportunities to deploy more capital against organic growth weve been clear thats our top priority and so thats why well were continuously revisiting where and how much we should allocate to marketing discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator our next question comes from line of ryan nash of goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so roger john on capital post this quarters performance youre at cet1 you talked about reevaluating in the second half of the year i guess given the outlook for credit potential for further reserve releases i think its safe to say you guys are going to be building capital in the near term so how should we think about the timeframe of getting back to that cet1 level and how does cecl day one factor into that and i guess roger as a followup to that just given all the capital sitting around does it at all change the way you think about acquisitions and if so what would be the priority thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services okay hey ryan thanks thanks for the question ill start it and then ill turn it over to roger for the second piece of the question so really really strong performance and the economy has strengthened beyond our expectations as we said in our prepared remarks so we came into the year somewhat optimistic but also cautious given the amount of uncertainty what were seeing is kind of a broad base improvement in the economy our credit fundamentals have been extremely strong as a result we made a decision to an appropriate decision to release about million of reserve taking the obviously cet1 ratio well above our internal target of were looking to come back to that point were not going to do it overnight we know the cecl transition is somewhere between and basis points on cet1 but that still leaves ample room for actions in terms of dividends buybacks and targeted ma when and if appropriate so specifics around timing getting back to i would broadly say medium term but were certainly committed to that target and well do a number of efforts including revisiting our buyback levels in the second half of this year to get there and the followup might be what do we expect the buyback levels to be incrementalized to were not going to give specifics but i will give a little bit of history if you go back and our level of buybacks was about billion im not saying history is going to repeat it will be subject to a bunch of conversations with our team internally and obviously board approval but will continue to evaluate so roger do you want to roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 yeah and on the ma front we try and be disciplined and so i would say would not let extra money burn a hole in our pocket for those of us for those of you whove been with us for longer youll recall we had significant excess capital post the financial crisis were limited by the payout ratios and the ccar process but as said we will return it over time and stay disciplined so as we think about ma opportunities on the banking side not much out there that fits with our digital model youre seeing acquisitions that are branch mergers cost takeout which doesnt fit and then on the payment side while valuations have come in theyre still really high and so we lean a bit more towards partnerships potentially smaller minority investments so again i think you can expect no change to our disciplined approach around returning capital to our shareholders ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and if i could squeeze in one other so on the slightly higher expenses john can you maybe just help us what is the base for that is it gaap or adjusted and then second roger theres numerous mentions of accelerating investments in data analytics and account growth can you maybe just give us a sense for what you would need to see for those for you to bring those investments on in term whether its in the macro account acquisition or what would you expect to drive that thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services great real quick first part of your question the expense growth relative to gaap last year ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc yeah roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services and then on the investment side a lot of those are on capabilities especially in the data and analytic area that just enhance all parts of our operations whether its the credit underwriting the marketing targeting personalization collections et cetera and so they have given the return profile part of it is just bandwidth and talent i would say are more gating factors but were really excited about the benefits and then in terms of putting more dollars to work on the marketing side itll vary competitive activity has a bit of an impact on that but we will just look at on the new account side what were seeing across different channels and carefully at those marginal opportunities and the returns they generate ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color operator our next question comes from the line of john pancari of evercore isi john pancari q analyst evercore group llc discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john pancari q analyst evercore group llc given your commentary on expenses and your plan to invest selectively there on the marketing side can you perhaps maybe help us think about the efficiency trend longer term i know you came in around in terms of the ratio this quarter did you think about what is a reasonable longterm expectation as we look out thanks john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah happy to cover that so as we went through the pandemic we really scrutinized the expense base and theres been a long history of expense discipline in this company and through the pandemic we found certain opportunities so as we think about the balance this year next year and going forward were going to continue to focus on controlling corporate costs so that we can invest savings back into overall growth levers and weve done that and were going to continue to do that as we think about the efficiency ratio well come in this year somewhere around where we finished last year i think assuming revenue comes in with the modest growth we talked about in loans and going forward i would expect somewhere in the upper would be a reasonable spot that will indicate that were driving efficiencies and still investing into business roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services any followup john operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache of wolfe research bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc roger and john theres a lot of debate taking place around whats going to happen with rates whether we get more steepening at the long end and when well get liftoff at the short end is discovers ability to get to a mid rotce at all impacted and what happens with rates maybe another way to ask it is can you talk about your confidence level and being able to get to a say mid25 type rotce even if reserve remains in place john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thanks bill so specific to rates so if rates begin to increase theres indications that a number of different things are happening in the economy so you would expect inflation to be increasing a very very low level of unemployment probably near full employment for the economy and a robustness that might rival kind of the pre pandemic levels on a sustained basis and so you have to believe that a lot of different things are going to happen and that the fed also will take some actions to control inflation discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 now weve seen this over a number of years now that the fed and overall interest rate environment has been on a sustained basis very very low as we look forward to and my expectation is rates will remain low and well enjoy the benefits of an economy thats continuing to grow beyond that it gets different it is more difficult to call in terms of total return levels itll depend on a number of factors rate is just one of those credit obviously would be an important item but certainly longer term we think that were in a position to drive high returns for our shareholders consistent with what weve done historically and our hope is when we come back to that target that thatll further enhance overall returns bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it thank you as a followup can you discuss the opportunity in the student lending space among customers who may not have been thinking about refinancing their student debt to lower rate when their loans went forbearance but as well as start to exit forbearance is there going to be an opportunity for you guys to see an acceleration there roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so we dont really participate in the student loan refi market the pricing doesnt really meet our return hurdles to the extent there is more activity it can marginally impact the payment rate for student loans but we feel really good about where were positioned and i think last year was very challenging as a lot of kids either deferred for a year or had reduced expenses because they didnt have meals or housing et cetera so again we feel good about what this peak season should bring and our ability to continue gaining share bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my questions roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services thanks bill operator our next question comes from line of betsy graseck of morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services good morning discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc couple of questions one you were talking earlier about widening standards in particular in card and i just wanted to get a sense as to what youre expecting that will drive is that both an increase in accounts as well as higher lines extended to your existing accounts and then could you give us some color on how you expect to pull in the new clients given the fact that the consumer is in a fantastic spot are you pulling from other folks or do you feel like this is generating new demand from maybe a younger cohort thats not been borrowing yet some color on that could be helpful thanks roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so in terms of the credit expansion its probably more heavily impacting new accounts but also encompasses sort of our line increase in other criteria on the portfolio side as well in terms of what we expect i would say in all times we give cards to consumers who are in good shape but we do have particularly strong appeal to millennials and students our secured card is performing well in the marketplace but then also the traditional prime revolver segment that discovers always targeted its a very competitive business it always has been so its about differentiation and there a superior customer experience a great rewards program focus on value those traditional things are what allow us to continue gaining share and booking new accounts betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc its interesting because your value prop very clear especially versus other card lenders with no fee et cetera how do you think youre positioned against the fintechs who also have a light or low or no fee proposition betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc so there arent that many of the fintechs that are active yet in the card space by and large they do loans of different types and so weve yet to see a significant i would say fintech player in the card space and most of our competition tends to be the traditional leaders in the marketplace betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and if i could squeeze one in for john you mentioned in answer to the prior question or two ago around the total expense outlook that youre thinking about for the full year and i think you mentioned that youre expecting to come in similar to the end of and then from there as we look to and beyond migrate back towards like the high could you just give us some color as to the end of expense ratio that youre thinking about because theres a couple different ways that you could slice it based on onetimers is that a run rate thats north of on the efficiency side maybe you can help us understand your sizing there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so we used a gaap basis on that and so the onetimers that were included in underlying number that actually we didnt publish but we called out the underlying numbers it was about million so the operating efficiency is going to be dependent upon what we see in terms of loan growth payment rate and new account discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 generation which as roger said and ill echo the comment were very positive about how were positioned to drive growth in this especially in the second half of the year as the payment rate abates a bit so what you can expect here and im trying to try to provide as much detail as i can is that outside of the marketing investments we talked about some select investments in data and analytics were looking to keep all other costs flat and were going to manage that envelope as we see opportunities but well be able to use that as a jumpingoff point to drive further improvements and efficiencies in and beyond betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and so the million is what we should ex out to get to operating ph on the expense side john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services subject to growth and what we see is opportunities betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc great john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services so theres no absolutes but and as time goes on well have more clarity on the opportunities betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc and 4then if i look prepandemic right roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so betsy we do want to do betsy we do have some other questions to get to betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc all right roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so well follow up later thanks betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc bye operator our next question comes from the line of mark devries of barclays discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc thanks just hoping you could give us some color on where we should expect the reserve ratio to migrate to is it appropriate to think about it going back to kind of the cecl dayone level and if so at what pace could we get there john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah thank you so we took a meaningful chunk out of the reserve levels this quarter honestly the credit outlook and our models indicated that there was a range of different outcomes we could have made on that and what we tried to do was take a chunk out of the reserves that made sense given the level of absolute uncertainty in the economy as we look forward the absolute reserve level or reserve rate will depend on what we see in the macros how the portfolio is performing and what we do in terms of account growth loan balance but overall as we think about where the provision levels could be i would use the day one cecl rate as a decent proxy and subject to how the portfolio is performing it could migrate up or down from there what we did last year in the first quarter and the second quarter was react to an incredibly dynamic and changing macro environment and we prudently put up an incremental billion so the portfolio performs over time we could get back to that cecl day one and perhaps a little bit lower with excellent portfolio management now timing im not going to be specific at mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc okay thats helpful thank you operator our next question comes from the line of don fandetti of wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning roger as we went through the pandemic obviously theres more ecommerce spend and is there anything that youve learned in terms of like how you would position the company differently it seems like big tech and technology are continuing to gain more touch points with customers is there anything strategically that you want to lean into or youve learned roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah great question i think it really accelerated a lot of trends that were existing prior to pandemic right so consumers were already migrating more and more of their shopping online but thats moved even quicker their customer interactions were moving more towards digital that accelerated even further so i think that it has recommitted to the path we were on and looking to accelerate some of the functionality certainly there were some specific things around the tapandgo cards a lot of small dollar transactions migrating from cash to debit that benefited our pulse volumes but i would say in general not so much new trends but three four or fiveyear accelerations of trends that were already there and that we had been positioning the company to take advantage of discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it and on the potential investments or partnerships would those be accretive or could they potentially be more technology investments roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services where we traditionally made them on the payment side is with partners they either add capabilities or to cement a relationship that will drive volume over our network on the technology side we found plenty of great partnersvendors out there that you dont need people dont need money in the current environment and so thats why weve tended not to do investments in pure technology companies that arent payments related donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc thank you operator our next question comes from the line of rick shane of jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc as you look forward to loan growth how much opportunity is there to categoryspecific rebound thats more ph in depth to borrow like travel for example roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services great question i think that will be constructive some of the categories that were strongest through the downturn though had a pretty good revolve rate so you think about home improvement that was really doing well so a lot of it i think will be in the restaurant and travel segment but i wouldnt necessarily expect a huge boost to revolve rate just given again some of the categories that were strong in the downturn richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it okay thank you very much operator our next question comes from the line of mihir bhatia of bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my question just really quickly i wanted to ask about competitive intensity first are you seeing any impact on cost of acquisition as customers have come back i know that has trended very well last year and thats an area you will be making investments in and then maybe ill just ask my the related question i had on that last year discovers no annual fee no cashback card was just really well suited for the backdrop as we reopen and maybe travel rewards become more relevant for consumers are you seeing any impact on your usage any early indicators from consumers who had discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 maybe moved your card to top of wallet last year and what youre seeing so just i guess competitive intensity more broadly thank you roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so ill start with the second one we are not seeing an impact and we think the lesson learned in the pandemic of the utility of cash rewards hopefully will last and we feel very good about even the newer redemption offers weve added so the ability to redeem at point of sale at paypal with amazon we just announced the ability to redeem for carbon offsets which we think will be popular with millennials so no real change to that in terms of competitive intensity we talked about i would say just extraordinarily attractive cost per account last year as there was a significant pullback i think were now moving towards more normalized levels of competition and my guess is well see that increase but our job is to grow the business in face of competition thats there and so while i missed the cpas from last year we feel good about the returns well generate from our marketing even in a more intense environment mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you operator our next question comes from the line of john hecht of jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc good morning guys thanks very much for taking my question roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services good morning john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc first question roger you addressed some of this with respect to loan growth maybe you talked about it being a mix of line utilization new customers im wondering is there one bigger contribution to that relative to the others and whats the cadence is this more of a second half factor or is this going to be balanced over the course of the year roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services yeah so on the cadence i do expect marketing expenses to ramp up over the course of the year they werent overly large q1 but again with the wider credit box well get more leverage for the marketing spend so we would expect a ramp but well look at that continuously and make adjustments as we see fit in terms of the impact of the credit changes its probably more heavily weighted towards the new account side versus portfolio but we always look for a blend of those two as we think about growth discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay and then john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services and then john hecht q analyst jefferies llc john with the sorry john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services sorry go ahead john please go ahead john hecht q analyst jefferies llc id just say john i guess more of a kind of constant question is were a year into cecl now and obviously its had a pretty big impact in how things have turned out from a gaap perspective how do you stack the major decisionmaking factors with respect to your all now is it the moodys model is that unemployment is it just your internal opinion of your performance trends how have things changed with respect to the way you look at that all level john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah good question so certainly evolving so we use moodys and also two other providers so the broad macros are very important the portfolio performance itself is also obviously a key input and we have a team of technical modelers that run various scenarios regression sort of scenarios to help make a determination on what overall life of loan losses could be which is a key input because theres probably to different variables that go into that model that help do the projection and then the other piece is your loan balance right and what you have on the balance sheet as of the measurement date in order to set reserve so i would say all of those factors are important and then finally one other one is recovery rate which actually also does go into the model so four important factors and weve taken a measured approach to ensure that our balance sheet is appropriately stated and were on the conservative end of the judgment calls john hecht q analyst jefferies llc appreciate the content thank you discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 operator our next question comes from the line of meng jiao of deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hi good morning thanks for taking my call indiscernible travel and restaurants and retail seem to have pretty much materially accelerated from february into march and in any way for restaurants have you guys seen that carrying over into april as well john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah yeah we have actually incredibly the sales performance the first three weeks of april versus overall were up about and its three weeks into the month so things can change and then versus last year was certainly dented significantly by the pandemic were up on sales so really strong there and then the mix between revolvers and transactors obviously transactors are up higher than revolvers but revolvers are up almost near doubledigits versus prior year so all good meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thank you operator our next question comes from the line of moshe orenbuch of credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks most of my questions actually have been already asked and answered but maybe if you could just follow up on two quick points one is the payment rate stubborn stubbornly high payment rates and how that will likely decline i mean is there i guess maybe the question is how much of that is a function of the actual stimulus dollars versus some of the ongoing impacts that you highlighted whether its enhanced unemployment benefits or student loan interest forbearance in terms of thinking about the pace of that decline and then just very quickly you talked about the cecl day one just conceptually do you think that the life of loan has a higher or lower likelihood on january of a nearterm recession you did on january roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services so ill cover the first part and ill let john forecast recessions in terms of the elevated payment rate it is a mixed but you are seeing a lot of it come from the governmental support and so we do expect it to come down over the course of the year but remain elevated compared to historic levels and this is because households have a lot of savings withdrawn and there are just a lot of other forms of support so its not it is a headwind against loan growth its really being driven by external factors so i would say were not overly alarmed about it and again we would expect it to start drifting downward as we get further past the really extraordinary levels of government stimulus and ill pass it to john for questions on reserves john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 great so yeah i think what youre getting at is what will be our macro assumptions at the end of this year forecasting out the so today obviously theres no perfect answer or perfect insight i will say this the pent up demand for consumers i believe is fairly pronounced and will continue to drive spending activity through this year and well into next year so that to me indicates that the macros should be positive through beyond its really difficult to call at this point moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome thanks thanks for the questions operator our next question comes from the line of kevin barker of piper sandler kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co good morning could you give us a little bit more detail on some of the investments that youre making on data analytics and driving account growth and also is there any way to quantify how much incremental spend youre putting into that and returns that are being generated from that whether its additional growth or other trends that we can identify to quantify the growth or the investment returns that youre getting john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah great so ill hit the second part of that question first so in terms of returns we have a rigorous process where we take a look at incremental investments to ensure that they deliver strong cash on cash returns and in terms of roes or return thresholds i wont be specific but very very strong doubledigits ph on those in line with what you can expect from the company on a normalized basis in terms of return on capital in terms of what were investing in data analytics on specifically on looking at attrition from the portfolio we feel like theres an opportunity to reduce attrition level through some early identification of customers who may not be maximizing the usage of the card we have data analytics projects going on in collections i mentioned in our prepared remarks in fraud and fraud analytics so theres frankly theres almost insatiable demand for these sorts of programs and what we are were being very very selective in terms of making sure that we prioritize the highest returning ones in the current year kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services youre welcome discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 eric wasserstrom a vice president head of investor relations discover financial services maria why dont we make this our last question please operator our final question comes from the line of dominick gabriele of oppenheimer dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thank you so much for taking my question i just wanted to go back to the expenses and sorry i dont mean to beat the dead horse here if you look at the gaap operating expenses in the fourth quarter of they were almost about billion are we expecting a quarter that could be that high or just because there was it seemed to be a little i got a little confused on one of the comments there so is that reasonable to think that one of the quarters could be near that billion level john t greene a chief financial officer executive vice president discover financial services yeah so im certainly not in the business of forecasting quarterly i will tell you this from an expense standpoint the marketing expense for the balance of the year we expect will continue to grow into the kind of that envelope we talked about earlier the quarteroverquarter comparisons are frankly relatively challenging given what happened in in terms of our focused approach to look at every single dollar that potentially was going out of the out the door on an expense item so i would just focus on the broad numbers and the quarterly breakouts ill leave it to you to figure out what makes the most sense we hear and were looking at that and and dont specifically try to manage to any particularly particular quarter quarterly number dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc makes sense and then i guess if you kind of look at what happened this quarter with the kind of benefits that you guys have with having not only a lending business but one that also gains interchange that really helped offset some of the slowdown in loans i guess do you expect that we could see that discovers proprietary network being much higher as far as a growth base is going forward yearoveryear versus your loan growth in do you expect that divergence to be there for at least a few quarters thanks so much guys really appreciate it roger c hochschild a president chief executive officer director discover financial services sure so our total network spend is benefiting from growth in some of our thirdparty payments areas if you include the debit side pulse is growing very strongly and so thats helpful but we also believe that having a proprietary network is an important differentiator and gives us a whole series of capabilities that helps us grow our banking business so again total volume will depend somewhat on some of the partners and we are a little skewed towards debit for the thirdparties but were going to work for a continued robust volume growth dominick gabriele q analyst oppenheimer co inc okay thanks so much discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q1 earnings call 22apr2021 eric wasserstrom vice president head of investor
