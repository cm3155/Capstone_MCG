is truly an honor and a privilege to talk to you today for the first time as the ceo of synchrony building on our strong foundation i believe synchrony is exceptionally well positioned for this next chapter of our growth journey there is strong momentum in the business driven by the ongoing implementation of our strategy and the unwavering hard work and commitment of our people while this past year has been challenging and unprecedented in many ways we are starting to see positive signs of recovery and we are seeing the benefits of the strategic initiatives that we accelerated in the new programs that we launched last year i am very optimistic and excited about the opportunities ahead and im honored to lead synchrony into the future and with that id like to get into some of the highlights of our first quarter results earnings were billion or per diluted share an increase of over last year the resilience of our business has been evident as we navigated the pandemic from the underlying fundamentals of our business including diverse programs and networks and solid underwriting to our ability to quickly adapt to meet the moment with easily integrated seamless digital solutions we have demonstrated that our business is structured to execute even in the most challenging operating environments and as we begin to emerge from this challenging period we have seen many of our growth drivers outperform prepandemic levels experienced during the first quarter of last year importantly purchase volume increased a strong over last year with a substantial increase in purchase volume per account of 18while were seeing strong trends on purchase volume loan receivables were down to billion given elevated payment rates with the infusion of additional stimulus this quarter though average balances per account have rebounded increasing over the first quarter of last year as have new accounts which were up net interest margin was down basis points to as further stimulus continued to elevate payment rates which lowered our receivable mix and yield the efficiency ratio was for the quarter we are on track with our strategic plans to reduce our expense base removing million of expenses by the end of the year credit continued to perform exceedingly well with net charge offs of this quarter compared to last year as a result of our liquidity and funding strategy in response to the covid19 impact on our balance sheet deposits were down billion or versus last year given our excess liquidity we have been slowing our overall deposit growth total deposits comprised of our funding as our direct deposit platform remains an important funding source our ability to service and provide digital tools to customers makes our bank attractive to depositors and we will continue to build out additional capabilities during the quarter we returned million in capital through share repurchases of million and million in common stock dividends we continue to have a solid pipeline of new opportunities across our platforms but synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 we are being very disciplined around risk and returns and it is critical to ensure that our partnerships are structured with strong alignment that benefits both parties having said that as we previously announced we will not renew our partnership with the gap as we were not able reach terms that made sense for our company we expect that exiting this partnership and redeploying the capital will be eps neutral relative to current program economics and accretive to proposed renewal terms we have been on a journey to grow with partners who leverage our digital capabilities to help them drive sales and meet the rapidly changing needs of their customers our ability to win programs with transformational digital innovations has been demonstrated with a number of recent wins and these capabilities are also integral to the success of all of our programs as consumers are rapidly adopting technologies that enable contactless commerce and expect engagement along their digital purchase journeys we are leveraging our vast digital assets as well as our strong data analytics capabilities to make the entire consumer experience more personalized and meaningful we have continued to expand our digital penetration across the customer journey from apply to buy to servicing approximately of our applications were done digitally during the first quarter and we grew in mobile channel applications in retail card of our sales occurred online and approximately of payments were made digital the investments we are making in digital and data analytics continue to pay off during the quarter we renewed programs including american eagle ashley homestore citgo and phillips we also added new programs including prime healthcare mercyhealth and emory healthcare which furthers our penetration of health systems and we are also expanding the utility of our carecredit card our patient financing app is now available on the epic app orchard this makes carecredit available to hundreds of health care organizations using epics mychart and enabling card holders to use carecredit to pay copays deductibles and medical expenses not covered by insurance not only does this technology integration provide a way to increase usage and acceptance of carecredit but also helps health services and hospital providers to run efficient financially healthy organizations by helping to improve revenue cycle management and reduce debt risk we are excited by the prospects to support patients beyond elective care as we expand to offer payment options for nonelective medical expenses in routine care ill spend a few minutes today outlining our carecredit strategy and providing a framework to think about the opportunities that lie ahead over the last several years weve been transforming carecredit to become a more comprehensive solution for consumer financing and payments in healthcare pet care and wellness by expanding our relationships with providers retailers payers and pharmacies we have unparalleled scale and depth in this space with billion in receivables and acceptance at approximately enrolled provider health and wellness retail locations the card is used by more than million cardholders we are in more than of dental offices nationwide and over healthcare specialties of which we entered into since we see big opportunity in health systems and hospitals and have rapidly expanded our reach by launching eight new programs in bringing our total to with the growth in our pet vertical we are now in over of vet practices and have grown pets in force by since our acquisition of the pets best insurance business two years ago synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 a big part of our success is the engagement we have with our cardholders our cardholders give us high marks as we have increased our customer satisfaction score to from back in our net promoter score is nearly double the credit card industry average and as proof of the value our cardholders place on the card weve been able to increase our repeat sales to nearly that is a testament to the hard work that weve put in to creating a strong value proposition for the card and for increasing utility as we build our network one office and provider at a time and our growth numbers reflect these efforts and the position we hold in the space our receivables have increased in seven years we have also increased the breadth of our business with an increase in provider locations to in that timeframe and active accounts currently stand at million another doubledigit increase in seven years we have built an incredible platform for growth and we are in an enviable position as we chart the course forward continuing to evolve to capture further opportunity theres still tremendous opportunity to continue to unlock growth in dental veterinary and specialty industries we are making investments to simplify the customer and provider experience and leveraging technology to support more consumerdriven selfservice capabilities we have ample room for growth with increased penetration among our existing partners and through innovation to make it increasingly easy to engage with our network just recently we acquired allegro credit which has both deepened our penetration in audiology and other industries while also enabling new products and capabilities with a steady increase in outofpocket healthcare costs and the popularity of highdeductible healthcare plans consumers are assuming more of the financial responsibility for their healthcare this translates to a significant opportunity of more than billion in outof pocket health expenditures in the us but flexible and extended financing is only a small component of overall healthcare payments so there is significant runway for growth were also expanding beyond the traditional carecredit industries and capitalizing on the evolving healthcare landscape that has increased focus on overall wellness we have moved beyond elective care financing and now support patients by enabling them to pay for nonelective medical bills planned procedures and routine medical care as we expand into health systems and more healthcare specialties this will be enhanced by ongoing integrations with practice management software and the recent news about carecredit becoming available through epics app orchard further we have expanded our utility creating more ways to access healthcare services by partnering with pharmacies carecredit is already accepted at more than pharmacies nationwide and we recently announced that we will become the issuer of the walgreens cobranded credit card program in the us the first such credit program in the retail health sector and expect to launch the new program in the second half of we are also transforming our pet business to be a more comprehensive financial solution provider and to meet the needs of pet parents throughout their pet care journey now more than ever americans are invested in their pets with both pet ownership and cost increasing significantly over the past several years and that trend grew even more during the pandemic americans spend more than billion on pet expenditures there is a large market outside of vet practices with significant opportunity to provide new products financing alternatives and services carecredit supports a lifetime of care for pets and with the acquisition of pets best insurance we currently offer a complementary solution with veterinary care to support pet owners with simple flexible financial options we synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 continue to integrate the pets best insurance offering to capitalize on the payment and customer experience synergies and were also looking for ways to expand into other pet adjacencies through products and services in retail by focusing on the needs of our partners and customers and bringing substantial scale and expertise we believe we will drive royalty to the carecredit network and as a result should see outsized growth in the future with that ill turn the call over to brian brian j wenzel sr executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks brian and good morning everyone this is an important period of time for our company and the world as we continue to emerge from the pandemic our business and the actions weve taken over the past year leave us wellpositioned to take advantage of the opportunities which lie ahead of us i share brians sentiment of appreciation on the unwavering commitment of our people i want to thank all those involved in development delivery and administration of vaccines to help us emerge from this incredibly difficult period of time ill now provide an update on our first quarter results the pandemic and resulting government stimulus actions have impacted several key areas of our business over the past year however our business mix has helped us to mitigate some impact from the pandemic as certain areas have performed very well including digital homerelated products and services veterinary services electronics and appliances performance in these areas have provided support against the overall effects of the economic downturn as we exit the first quarter we are starting to see greater signs of economic recovery more broadly purchase volume increased versus last year and exceeded our expectations for the quarter from a macroeconomic perspective we have seen consumer confidence reach a oneyear high in march unemployment continued to improvement and easing of some of the remaining local restrictions this is evident in the increase in purchase volume per account which is up over last year average active accounts were down which marks a slowing in the rate of decline that remains impacted by the macroeconomic effects of the pandemic in and uneven recovery in the first quarter we did originate over million new accounts an increase of versus first quarter which is a positive sign and reflective of improved consumer sentiment loan receivables declined which is worse than our expectations the driver was higher than expected elevation in payment rates which resulted primarily from the recently enacted stimulus interest and fees on loans were down from last year driven by the elevated payment rate in addition to lower delinquencies dual and cobranded cards accounted for of the purchase volume in the first quarter and increased in the prior year on a loan receivable basis they accounted for of the portfolio and declined from the prior year overall we saw positive momentum in several of our growth metrics this quarter where higher payment rates is impacting loan receivable growth while were still cautious about the state of the pandemic with the recent rise in confirmed cases we are encouraged by the progress made with the national rollout of the vaccine and lifting of some of the remaining restrictions we remain optimistic of the positive momentum and continuing improvement as we progress through synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 rsas increased million or from last year rsas as a percentage of average receivables was for the quarter this was elevated from the historical average primarily due to the significant improvement in net charge offs we reduced our loan loss reserves this quarter due to an improved macroeconomic outlook combined with the decline in loan receivables this coupled with lower net chargeoffs resulted in significant decrease in the provision for credit losses of billion or from last year other income increased million mainly due to investment income other expense decreased million or from last year due to lower operational losses and lower marketing costs partially offset by an increase in employee costs moving to our platform results on slide our sales platforms continue to be impacted in varying degrees due to the pandemic restrictions and elevated payment rates their trajectories have been different based on factors such as business and partner mix digital concentration provider access and availability of hard line goods we have seen broadbased momentum in purchase volume as consumers become increasingly confident as we begin to exit the pandemic in retail card loan receivables declined but showed momentum with purchase volume increasing versus last year average active accounts were down and interest and fees were down due to the impact from the pandemic were excited with our renewal of the american eagle program and continue to see significant opportunity with our recently launched programs with verizon and venmo as those programs begin to build the strength of our power sports and home specialty and payment solutions continue to help offset some of the impact from pandemic shutdowns and higher payment rates during the quarter loan receivables declined and average active accounts were down interest and fees were down which was driven primarily by lower late fees finance charges and merchant discount all the resulted reduction in loan receivables we did see positive momentum in purchase volume which was up over last year our focus on growing this platform resulted in several new programs being signed and renewing key partnerships including ashley home furniture during the quarter we continue to drive organic growth through our partnerships and networks and added over new merchants during the quarter we also continue to drive higher card reuse which now stands at approximately of purchase volume excluding oil and gas although carecredit sustained the largest overall impact from the pandemic restrictions improvement in this platform has continued into as providers have increased elective and planned services from the trough in the second quarter of last year this improvement is evident in our purchase volume being flat to last year loan receivables were down this quarter and drove a decrease in interest and fees on loans of as we recorded lower late fees and merchant discounts during the quarter we continued to grow our carecredit network and enhanced the utility of our card the expansion of our network and acceptance strategy has helped us drive the reuse rate to of purchase volume in the first quarter this is a powerful growth platform for our business and we remain excited about the opportunities to drive future growth as the impact from the pandemic subsides ill move to slide and cover our net interest income and margin trends during the quarter recently enacted stimulus contributed to an elevation of payment rates which were up about percentage points on average synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 compared to the average payment rates we experienced prepandemic the difference was as high as percentage points in march when the most recent stimulus plan was enacted this has resulted in a reduction in loan receivables which has had an impact on net interest income and net interest margin in the first quarter net interest income decreased from last year driven by lower finance charges and late fees the net interest margin was compared to last years margin of largely driven by the impact of the pandemic on loan receivables and increase in liquidity and lower benchmark rates specifically the loan receivables yield of was down basis points versus last year and was a primary driver of 117basispoint reduction in our net interest margin the mix of loan receivables as a percent of total earning assets declined over percentage points from to driven by the higher liquidity held during the quarter this accounted for basis points of the net interest margin decline the liquidity yield declined as a result of lower benchmark rates and accounted for basis points reduction in our net interest margin these impacts were partially offset by a basis point decrease in the total interest bearing liabilities cost to primarily due to lower benchmark rates this provided a basis point increase in our net interest margin we continue to believe that in the second half of the year excess liquidity will begin to be deployed into asset growth and slowing payment rates should result in higher interest and fee yields leading to increasing net interest margin next ill cover key credit trends on slide in terms of specific dynamics for the quarter ill start with the delinquency trends our 30plus delinquency rate was compared to last year our 90plus delinquency rate was compared to last year higher payment rates continue to drive delinquency improvements focusing on net chargeoff trends our net chargeoff rate was compared to last year our reduction in net chargeoff rate was primarily driven by the improving delinquency trends as customer payment behavior improved over the last several quarters our allowance for credit losses as a percent of loan receivables was moving to slide ill cover our expenses for the quarter overall expenses were down million or from last year to million as we continue to execute on our strategic plan to reduce costs specifically the decrease was driven by lower operational losses and lower marketing and business development costs partially offset by higher employee costs the efficiency ratio for the first quarter was compared to last year the ratio was negatively impacted by lower revenue that resulted from lower receivables and lower interest and fee yield which was partially offset by a reduction in expenses moving to slide given the reduction in our loan receivables and strength in our deposit platform we continue to carry a higher level of liquidity while we believe its prudent to maintain a higher liquidity level during uncertain and volatile periods we are actively managing our funding profile to mitigate excess liquidity where appropriate as a result of this strategy theres a shift in the mix of our funding during the quarter our deposits declined by billion from last year our securitized and unsecured funding sources declined by billion this resulted in synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 deposits being of our funding compared to last year the securitized funding comprising and unsecured funding comprising of our funding sources at quarter end total liquidity including undrawn credit facilities was billion which equated to of our total assets up from last year before i provide details on our capital position it should be noted that we elected to take the benefit of the transition rules issued by the joint federal banking agencies which has two primary benefits first it delays the effect of the cecl transition adjustment for an incremental two years and second it allows for a portion of the current period provisioning to be deferred and amortized with the transition adjustment with this framework we ended the quarter at cet1 under the cecl transition rules basis points above last years level of the tier capital ratio was under the cecl transition rules compared to last year the total capital ratio increased basis points to and the tier capital plus reserve ratio on a fully phasedin basis increased to compared to last year reflecting the increase in the reserves as a result of implementing cecl during the quarter we returned million to shareholders which included million in share repurchases and paid a common stock dividend of per share given the continued uncertainty in the operating environment i thought itd be helpful to provide color on our current view on the key earnings drivers for which weve laid out on slide our views assume that the pressure from the pandemic and a slower economic recovery continues into the second quarter with the second half seeing the pandemic largely under control and the acceleration of the economic recovery first quarter purchase volume was stronger than we anticipated as we entered the year as local restrictions are lifted with consumer confidence improving so do consumers willingness to spend we currently believe these trends will hold and purchase volume will continue to recover across our platforms in the second quarter we will be comparing against a period of widespread shutdowns in the second half we anticipate improving growth trends as the pandemic impact moderates and macroeconomic growth accelerates regarding loan receivable growth we expect that stimulus will continue to have an impact on payment rates and therefore loan receivables into the next quarter in the second half of we assume payment rates will moderate as the effects of the stimulus abates and we return to more normalized consumer payment behavior patterns combining this with the expected increase in purchase volume from an improving macroeconomic environment this should contribute to loan receivable growth for net interest margin we expect the higher payment rates will continue to pressure loan receivables and generate excess liquidity impacting interest and fee yield and asset mix we continue to believe that excess liquidity will be reduced through asset growth and slowing payment rates in the second half of the year which will drive improving interest and fee yields and asset mix leading to increase in net interest margin with respect to credit delinquencies are expected to increase from their current levels so we now believe the peak will occur later than we anticipated likely in early while current delinquencies will result in lower net chargeoffs in the second quarter we expect net chargeoffs to rise resulting from the increases in delinquencies as we move through synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 given the magnitude of the stimulus that was deployed during the pandemic we believe the overall loss curve will be flatter than we initially thought but it remains volatile and difficult to forecast into the effects of the stimulus and industry forbearance has abated we expect reserves to be largely driven by asset growth impacts from any changes in credit and in our macroeconomic assumptions and certain combinations of these factors could result in further reserve releases this year we expect rsas to remain elevated into the second quarter primarily reflecting strong program performance including an improvement in net chargeoffs partially offset by lower revenue in the second half of the year we continue to expect lower rsas generally reflecting higher net chargeoffs partially offset by higher revenue as we outlined previously weve implemented cost reductions across the organization and im pleased to report that we are on a pace to achieve our expense savings target of million for the full year partially offsetting these cost reductions will be the expense increases ph for any growth in addition to anticipated increase in delinquent accounts we will continue to closely monitor how the pandemic develops and its impact to the macroeconomic environment at the foundations its our belief that we position ourselves well for the opportunities that will develop as the economic recovery takes from the hold further weve made the investments to support our partners as theyve been required to rapidly transform their businesses to meet the new digital realities and well continue to make investments in our people products technology and platforms to drive longterm value and continue to ensure the safety of our employees while meeting the needs of our partners merchants providers and cardholders ill now turn the call back over to brian for his final thoughts brian d doubles president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial thanks brian ill provide a quick overview of key themes for the quarter and then turn it over so we can begin qa clearly the pandemic has had significant impacts and has in many ways changed the way we do business this quarter made it evident that we are beginning to emerge on the other side of this period consumer sentiment has improved the unemployment rate has dropped and us retail posted the largest gain in months our business is showing its resilience as growth has accelerated with purchase volume up and million new accounts opened this quarter and although the solid growth metrics were tamped down by higher payment rates which impacted loan receivables and nim these are headwinds that we anticipate will soon abate credit performance has continued to outperform and we continue to expand our carecredit network delivering new products financing alternatives and experiences with a focus on overall wellness and pet the bottom line is that we demonstrated that we were able to rapidly adapt to operate in a new environment while continuing to keep our eye on the longterm positioning ourselves well for the future and in my opinion we have never been in a stronger position ill now turn the call back to jennifer to open the qa synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 jennifer church investor relations synchrony financial that concludes our comments for the quarter we will now begin the qa session so that we can accommodate as many of you as possible id like to ask the participants to please limit yourself to one primary and one follow up question if you have additional questions the investor relations team will be available after the call operator please start the qa session question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin our questionandanswer session operator instructions and our first question comes from moshe orenbuch with credit suisse moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great thanks brian i was hoping that you could talk just a little bit about the about this return to normalcy with respect to things like late fees and how thats impacted the net interest margin and the timing as well as perhaps the prepay speeds like what are the actual besides the injections of stimulus the ongoing effects like how should we think about the timeframe for both of those to get back to something approximating normal thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial thanks moshe and good morning so yeah clearly weve seen the headwind relative to stimulus we saw the cash flow really start back in midmarch around the indiscernible stimulus started to hit so from there we continue to see elevated payments they are starting to trend down a little bit now as we get into latter part of april obviously we have a converging factor with tax returns so stimulus clearly is the number one factor when you think about the late fee yield if you went back and looked at our number of delinquent accounts theyre down over from the period so prepandemic so again as you think about a rising net charge off or even just the return to normalcy when you think about the chargeoff environment that late fee yield will come back into the book and come in in advance of when the chargeoffs actually hit so we would expect to see that yield begin to increase in the back half of the year what id say moshe is a lot of people focus on the margin of the business were at today weve kind of guided people to call it the range in a normalized environment if you break down the components of that for a second the first piece is really the excess liquidity which i started with with the stimulus factors right so if you went back and looked at excess liquidity prepandemic applied that to the book today youll probably pick up about basis points of net interest margin from there we previously talked about theres probably or so basis points basis points in the benchmark rates which well see how prime comes and the residual amount right which is the mainly late fee yield and interest yield will come back into the book and that will rise so i think you can see a trajectory where this begins to accelerate in the back half of the year and begins to approach normalcy for us as we move into synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc great and as a followup you mentioned the million new accounts im assuming thats still with kind of sluggish retail openings could that number get better and any update that you can give us on the verizon and venmo programs specifically thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah moshe this is brian doubles i think we would certainly expect that number to continue to grow were not in a fully open economy right now as you know i think theres look theres a lot of reasons to be bullish when you look at the consumer you look at the trends on jobs unemployment back to i think consumer balance sheets are strong and theyre starting to spend again i think the fact that we saw purchase volume growth and of retail card is a really positive indicator but thats not where it should be in a fully functioning open economy and so i think theres still room across all the growth metrics to go further from here were still in the early innings in terms of a recovery but most of the trends that were seeing are pretty positive the fact that we grew purchase volume per account up is a really good indicator that consumers are spending again and i do think that will turn into more revolving behavior over time i mean the effects of the stimulus as brian said are going to theyre going to wane over time i think youre going to start to see that pretty soon as the confidence gets better you tend to see consumers take on more debt and revolve a little bit more which will help on balances and margins as well brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the only thing id add brian is as you think about the new account originations we havent touched the credit box brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial right brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i do think as we begin to continue to move through the year we are making credit refinements to expand credit but we havent done that in acquisition so that will also provide a tailwind as we move throughout the year moshe brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial and then moshe just on venmo and verizon a lot to be excited about on both of those programs venmo its still early but were ahead of our expectation in terms of new accounts and spend the feedback from customers on the card has just been phenomenal they love the val prop and the fact that it automatically optimizes the rewards for the spending categories where youre spending the most they love the card design the qr code so the feedback has just been terrific synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 and then verizon which is a little bit further along id say were seeing really good purchase volume its definitely behaving like a topofwallet card which is what we wanted so so far so good on both and i continue to believe that both can be top programs for us in the future moshe orenbuch q analyst credit suisse securities usa llc got it thank you very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial great thanks moshe have a good day operator we have our next question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning just want to followup on the comments on loan growth i guess when i think about your framework and outlook for the year do you feel like youre more constructive on loan growth as we look out for the rest of the year and then just specifically to that offline recovery are you guys anticipating an offline recovery because it would seem like it would impact that loan growth more significantly than others brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yes good morning sanjay yeah as we think about loan growth here we entered the quarter optimistic on the positioning as we exit the quarter were probably a bit more optimistic than that so weve seen broadbased recovery when you look at retail card up that is both the expansion of digital as well as some of the as you call them offline retailers kind of coming into play i think from a receivables standpoint we are seeing strong volume some of that is obviously buoyed by the stimulus dollars that came in in march but we saw strength across each of the months in the quarter so it outperformed what our expectations are and as i think about loan growth i think you probably will see an inflection point here in the second quarter and acceleration into the back part of the year so i do think youll see positivity come through the portfolio and again we have the tailwinds that still existed in the carecredit platform right as you have dental implant services opening up and you still have the supply chain issues in the payment solutions platform so theres a lot of tailwinds that are in place besides what weve already seen so again were optimistic about where we are and how the second quarter will play out and what weve seen to date in the quarter and then how the back half of the year looks sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great and just a followup brian doubles maybe you could just talk a little bit more about the gap relationship loss and sort of how you see it affecting the industry as a whole with newer players coming in and possibly doing synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 some aggressive pricing type stuff i mean how do you think that affects the future pipeline and are you seeing deals in your pipeline that look interesting brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah thanks sanjay look i think this was a bit of a unique situation id say we had a really good partnership for a number of years we had great feedback actually from the client on our partnership model our products our capabilities and i think at the end of the day this one just came down to terms and price and our competition was just a lot more aggressive on both there were some i would call them really out of market terms where they were looking for guaranteed revenue that increased annually regardless of how the program performed and for context just given the turnaround that theyve been working through the program had been shrinking and so theres really only so far you could go to guarantee those types of payments on a program like that so look we tried to reach an agreement at the end of the day there just wasnt a way for us to get our interests aligned but i do think this is a pretty unique situation i look at the pipeline today across all three platforms weve got really attractive opportunities with very strong partners at attractive returns where our interests are aligned and i think that is so important we talked about this for a number of years we want programs where our interests are aligned and growing the program were doing that in a way that benefits both parties so i still feel really good about the pipeline as i look across all three platforms sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial great thanks sanjay have a good day operator our next question is from ryan nash with goldman sachs ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial good morning ryan synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so brian youre running at cet1 if i look at this quarter you earned over billion reserves are likely coming down and even with the return to growth youre likely to accrete quarter capital in the coming quarters even using the existing billion buyback so i was wondering maybe could you just talk about the strategy for getting cet1 back towards peer levels and is there the potential for you to revisit your capital return as for the coming quarters thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks ryan so obviously in the first quarter we repurchased million of shares in the quarter that was part of the billion we announced in the early part of january and just to put that frame of reference obviously when we went to the board and discussed with the board that authorization that was in the december timeframe off the models as we move through the quarter clearly we have more information weve updated our scenarios we submitted our capital plan to the fed in march and look forward to their feedback later this quarter so obviously well see what the results of that come back but were optimistic with regard to their support for our capital plan its not lost on us that we have the excess capital ryan in the second quarter well again be subject to the limitations by the fed which will cap us out around million for the current quarter with regard to the amount of repurchases that we can do i would make the presumption we will be depending upon market conditions at that maximum and then well be back to you and talk about the capital plan that we submitted back to the fed that being said to the extent that the income profile of the business changes we have not in that capital plan dealt anything with gap and if that portfolio conveys that we would potentially revisit that and go back to the fed if its warranted so well continue those discussions and dialogues with the board and most certainly with our regulators so there is an opportunity with regard to your cadence question clearly we want to get back to our longterm goal being in line with peers and well do that as prudently as possible but obviously we want to do it with the support of all our constituents theyre not barriers to doing it we just want to do it in a prudent fashion and most certainly were not totally done with the pandemic here but well move as prudently as possible to execute that ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it and maybe just as a ph sanity check a followup to moshes question how should we think about the pacing of nii improvement relative to the pacing of loan growth given all the dynamics on margin and the normalization of credit over time as we see these factors abating should we see nii materially outpacing loan growth as we normalize thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah i would probably think theyre more moving in sequence as of in the early part of this quarter as you get to the back part of the year when you start seeing the late fee yield come in you may see the nii accelerate a little bit faster but it will really depend upon that delinquency formation ryan synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for taking my questions brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial thanks ryan brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks ryan have a good day operator our next question is from betsy graseck with morgan stanley betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial good morning betsy brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc a couple of questions just on the capital targets could you just give us a sense as to where you think optimized is for you over the next cycle here and part of the reason for the question is im trying to understand how youre going to be thinking about your capital to fund loan growth or on the flip side do you feel like your loan growth can be fully funded by the liquidity mix shift so just give us some color there would be helpful thanks brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah let me with the latter part of your question clearly the excess liquidity we have we believe sustains us with the loan growth that we see coming to the portfolio which again gets back to a more normalized level back half of the year weve talked about a potentially acceleration into as theres pent up demand and we believe the excess liquidity is ample enough to support that and most certainly with the earnings power of the business that we expect this year from a capital standpoint we should be able to support it with regard to the first part of your question with regard to those targets i mean we talked about peer targets so you think about the cap ones the discovers down in that to maybe range well see how the portfolio develops were optimistic we can get there in a reasonable period of time i think if you go back we exited ge with we made it down to before the pandemic hit and we think we can get back in a fairly synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 reasonable period of time and if you remember right before the pandemic hit we were on a path to execute a billion capital plan were billion into it so we think we can deploy it fairly rapidly once we feel comfortable betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thanks brian and then brian you were talking at the beginning of the call about carecredit and maybe you could help us understand the impact of the walgreens portfolio over time i think you mentioned that you could see verizon and venmo getting the top program maybe you could give us a sense as to how youre thinking about walgreens and then also how should we think about carecredit impact on rsas is it similar to the way that the retail program is run or is there any differences that we should be aware of thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah sure betsy i think look carecredit i think is probably the most exciting growth opportunity that weve got in the company today and we tried to lay that out for you in a couple of slides i think first just going after a market of this size thats growing as fast as it is obviously healthcare costs are rising high deductible plans are increasing in popularity so less and less is being covered by insurance and thats really where carecredit comes in were a big player in the space today but financing options in this space is still a very small fraction of the potential spend thats out there so there is just a ton of room for growth and i think about the growth in really three components one is growing the core were in carecredits accept in about locations today were in different specialties we just entered into new specialties just over the last two years and were in of dental offices of that so weve got a lot of scale but with that said theres still a lot of room to grow penetration inside of those providers because thirdparty financing options is still a relatively small percentage so a lot of room for growth there and then we talked a little bit about both health systems were in large health systems today thats a growing part of our business were paired up with big players like kaiser permanente cleveland clinic and then we talked about pets as really that third leg of the strategy were seeing just unbelievable growth in our pet insurance business that we bought a couple of years ago up since we bought it so just a lot to be excited about and then you touched on walgreens we had our carecredit cards were accepted at walgreens we expanded that relationship to launch a new program and i think similar to venmo and verizon this can be a top program for us and were tapping into million mywalgreens customers so the opportunity is just huge and were actively working to get that launched in the second half of the year betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and rsa sorry go ahead brian brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the rsa will operate similar to how you see things operate in the retail card platform so it would be a similar type of alignment synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial for walgreens brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial for walgreens betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and would you ever go after the opportunity with individual doctor practices for their personnel needs or is this going to stay at the business level just wondering brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah in terms of financing the actual practice betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc yeah exactly brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah yeah thats an adjacency weve looked at in the past its on the screen we dont have any immediate plans to go there but definitely something to consider in the future betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks betsy have a good day brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial thanks operator our next question is from john hecht with jefferies john hecht q analyst jefferies llc morning guys synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial hey john john hecht q analyst jefferies llc thanks for taking my questions how are you i guess just going a little bit more its clear you did emphasize carecredit in the prepared remarks im wondering and you talked about the scale maybe can you just give us an update i think from a competitive position perspective youre dramatically larger than the next largest i mean but maybe talk about the competitive framework and just given the growth momentum there how much bigger as a percentage of call it loans receivables might carecredit be over the next few years brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah john were certainly probably the biggest player in the space that does what we do but we have seen competition come and go into the space over time i love the fact that we have the scale that we have its taken us decades to build this kind of scale and get embedded in locations so i would expect going forward to see outsized growth in carecredit relative to the rest of the business so i definitely think this becomes a bigger part of the business going forward were also increasing the level of investment that were making in carecredit weve invested quite a bit obviously over the last years but id say just recently with acquisitions and pet insurance we just recently acquired allegro credit were definitely seeing a lot of opportunities to invest both organically and inorganically which i think will just accelerate the growth rate here relative to the rest of the business john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay and then you guys you cited some good trends with respect to account adds recently but clearly theres been some churn as there always is in the portfolio is there any change in characteristics of where youre seeing some of the churn come from brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah john i dont think we see anything different clearly the opening up of more traditional retail we see an influx there and a little bit through the door population but theres no real fundamental shifts john hecht q analyst jefferies llc okay thanks guys very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial thanks john synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks john have a good day operator and we have our next question from don fandetti with wells fargo donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning brian obviously theres been a big proliferation of fintech companies and i was just curious as you look at your three businesses is there one or how would you rank them in terms of where youre watching closer and id be curious on carecredit it seems like that could be susceptible to fintech players maybe more so than other areas but i could be wrong on that just wanted to get your thoughts brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah no look i think you cant limit it to just one of the platforms obviously its a very competitive space right now the fintech landscape is changing every minute and we have to stay all over it across all three of our businesses and i think the teams doing a really good job of doing that so i dont think that we feel it more acutely in one area than another i think what we tend to feel from fintechs is they tend to do one thing really well and thats a luxury that they have and we are given our scale we have to do a lot of things really well to compete with them but i feel like were doing that across all three of our platforms so look competitions good at the end of the day it makes us better i dont feel like were losing share in any of our three platforms we still got a lot of opportunity for growth but its something we got to stay all over our teams watch this theyre talking to our partners and when they see people come into the space were doing our best to keep them out and solidify our relationship so i feel really good about were positioned competitively but you can never let your guard down you got to stay all over this donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc yeah and then in terms of not really touching credit underwriting standards it seems like some of the peers have started to loosen up are you just being cautious or do you still need to see something to get comfortable brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial no so don the way i would think about it is we have started to make refinements in our credit underwriting if you remember when we started back in the pandemic we did attaining more on proactive type of credit extension so we shifted the cutoff down on our private label and dual card product mix we reduced the number of proactive credit line increases we reduced the number of invitation to apply and prescreen type offers on new accounts synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 as we move through into what we started to do in places where we obviously have known customers we begun to unwind a lot of those credit refinements so we are shifting the cutoffs so more people can get a dual card which would be a slightly higher line but most certainly stimulate some spend in the world we have begun a number of credit line increase type programs which are customers that weve known and seen credit behavior and payment behavior patterns and then weve also begun to upgrade accounts from private label to dual card that would have qualified for dual card a year ago so were doing a number of things proactively we just have not touched at the point of acquisition changed any cutoffs things like that but again we didnt do a lot of that last year so i dont really expect us to do a lot of it changes now but we have begun proactive increases and the good news is given our portfolio were able to do that with customers we know and were not taking incremental risk in our eyes donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks don have a good day operator our next question is from rick shane with jpmorgan richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc good morning guys thanks for taking my questions look when we think about the nature of private label there is more by category concentrated behavior than you would expect to see with for example general purpose when you look forward to where there are opportunities for further recovery how do you think the portfolio and the opportunity indexes against that brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah rick i think probably the best way to think about it is you have to look at i know theres obviously ph tes has a big pullback were a little bit less concentrated there but certainly our dual cards will benefit from that and our general purpose card will benefit from that i think the fact that brick and mortar stores are opening again i think were certainly wellpositioned to benefit from that and then i think frankly the digital trends that we saw over the last year while were going to have some tough comps theyre coming up over the next few quarters i feel like some of that shift was certainly permanent and will stay and well benefit there as well so look if you look across the portfolio the one thing that i think about quite a bit and we hear this from all of our partners including all the providers in carecredit is there is a real pentup demand right for pretty much everything this pentup desire to spend and get back to normal were talking to our providers in carecredit and they cant keep up with the appointments because so many people over the last year they postponed things that werent critical they didnt want to go into the practices and now youre seeing all of that start to flush through synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 so i think regardless of the category there is a ton of pentup desire to spend and i think if travel and entertainment dining those things come back i think that also spurs other types of spend that well see both on our dual cards but also in some of our adjacencies brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial i think its also brian as you kind of pointed out were so broadbased when you think about inside retail card which is up in the first quarter i mean think about the breadth of lifestylespecialty groups over there think about the not only the american eagles but the dicks sporting goods when you got to valueoriented retailers such as sams club et cetera tjx that are in there we have such a wide breadth of coverage with regard to where spend happens it actually is a fairly nice tailwind as we come out of this period richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it thats very helpful and brian you bring up a really interesting point in terms of carecredit and it leads to my followup question which is do you think that there are certain categories of spend that translate naturally into a higher percentage of borrow brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial a higher percentage of borrow is that what you said rick richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc yeah so for example people may be more inclined not to borrow on a gas card but certainly if its a larger transaction like you might see through carecredit there would be more revolve brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah certainly we would expect to see that in carecredit with some of the bigger ticket purchases we tend to see really good revolve rates there and i do think it does depend a little bit on the size of the ticket i mean if somebody is getting braces for their kids thats a big ticket item they typically dont want to tie up their general purpose card utility with that purchase and thats where carecredit comes in and that can be done on a equal pay installment loan it can be done on a promotional financing product and we tend to see really good revolve rates there as well richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc great thank you guys very much brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah thanks rick brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 thanks rick have a good day operator and we have our next question from mihir bhatia with bank of america mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc hi good morning and thank you for taking my questions maybe just to start i was hoping you could share some color on how youre currently thinking about just buy now pay later and im thinking more in terms of the pay in type program versus some of the larger ticket things like payment solutions where you basically have a buy now pay later solution im thinking more just the smaller ticket pay in just how are you thinking about it is that something youre considering should we be expecting you to be in the market with something like that any timeframes that you can share there thanks brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah look i can tell you its definitely going to be a product that we offer were going to have something to market with a couple of partners later this year just to take a step back more broadly our strategy is really to provide a full suite of products we have such a diverse array of partners that we really can have a one size fits all strategy weve got to be able to offer revolving products shortdated installment longerterm installment equal pay products buy now pay later products and we want to do that in a way that we can bring that full suite of products to our partners and basically allow them to choose which products are best for their customers based on not only their customer but what types of products are they selling so not surprisingly bigger ticket items tend to steer more towards the longerterm installment that can be on a revolving product or closed end and then smaller ticket it tends to be shorterterm either through a product like setpay or a pay in type product so thats really the strategy provide that comprehensive suite of products and then take that to our partners and really allow them to select from that menu in terms of what meets their customer needs based on the products that theyre selling in their strategy mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay and any timelines or anything i guess ill move on from that i just wanted to clarify in terms of just your comments on loan balances i just wanted to make sure i understood that right do you think loan balances have troughed or are pretty close to troughing at this point i guess what im asking is do you see more pressure from payment rates in or do you think that those balances start increasing from here and if youve seen anything in april that youd be willing to share that would be great too thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial yeah thanks mihir so i think as you think about the beginning part of april we continued to see elevated payment rates from historical average that has tended to trail down a little bit we expect that to burn off during this quarter so with regard to a loan receivable trough my expectation would be that we are going to trough here most certainly we have seen very strong sales in the first or so days of april so our hope would be that we trough here in the second quarter and begin that acceleration up synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc understood thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thank you have a good day operator we have our next question from david scharf with jmp securities david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc hi good morning and thanks for squeezing me in here brian i just had one followup on carecredit most questions have been addressed can you just provide a little more maybe granularity or specificity around just how the payment product is marketed awareness is created for the transitional transition to more kind of non elective procedures im just ive seen carecredit displays at vets the counter tops of vets and other elective outlets but im trying to understand how as a member myself of a large healthcare system how i would even become aware of this as a payment option how its going to be marketed to me brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah a lot of it is again weve built this business over decades and a lot of it is awareness at the point of sale so when youre sitting in the waiting room for a vet appointment or dental appointment you see the promotional financing offer you see carecredit we actually talk about it in the providers and talk about the benefits of it and so thats the primary channel and at least has been historically we also have a provider locator and what were trying to do is move up funnel a bit so that at the time that youre booking your appointment because a lot of that is now happening online youre actually getting youre seeing the promotional financing offer so that that becomes kind of part of how youre thinking about your treatment so its not once you actually get to your appointment that you become aware of it you can actually go through the whole process well in advance of your appointment and think about how youre going to pay for whether its braces or whatever your treatments going to be and we found that to be really successful so weve been building that brand awareness over time it originated largely inside of a providers office but has certainly expanded to be more digital in nature through direct marketing and other channels david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc no i see and i believe you may have mentioned mychart at one point i mean once again just reflecting on particularly with the pandemic the expenses over the last ph few years yeah brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah getting integrated into the practice management software system is huge for us that is a really important aspect of the growth strategy here and for health systems our integration with epic inside of the dentists and the synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 vets their practice management software regardless of what they use we want to be completely integrated there so that it becomes part of the process for the office manager thats working there and you can imagine with providers we have a wide range of big providers small providers and keeping carecredit top of mind as a payment option is really critical to the future growth of that business david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc got it and just one last followup more programspecific on venmo i know you had mentioned it its still very early stages and i think you had commented its modestly kind of exceeding kind of expectations at this time can you give us a little color though on perhaps what percentage of the venmo user base has initially been targeted just trying to get its obviously a very younger skewing demographic i got to believe a lot of venmo users have very thin credit files just trying to get a sense for how we should think about the opportunity there in terms of the mix of current users brian d doubles a president chief executive officer and director synchrony financial yeah nothing i can provide specifically but i mean this is a huge opportunity to tap into million venmo customers obviously they have to meet our underwriting criteria and our screen but thats just a its a huge opportunity for us again no doubt this is going to be a top program and the early returns in terms of what were seeing on spend and accounts is ahead of what we thought it would be and we had we were pretty aspirational in terms of our expectations so very positive even though its only been in full launch mode for a couple of months brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial the only other thing id add here this is another point of the strength that we have brian right which is the ability to get data from our providers so when you think about where venmo may know a customer for a period of time watch the payment velocity see how long theyve been affiliated they can pass us that information so it actually helps us even though they may have a ph same credit or bureau the richness of the data that they have with paypal and venmo may be a help for us as we underwrite david m scharf q analyst jmp securities llc got it thank you very much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial have a good day jennifer church a investor relations synchrony financial thanks david vanessa we have time for one more question operator thank you our last question comes from dominick gabriele with oppenheimer synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc hey thanks so much for taking my question if you think about i just want to go back to the total business and i really appreciate all the color on carecredit but if we think about the cet1 and where that can go versus the general purpose players i think historically theres been a buffer between private label and general purpose cet1s and so do you expect that spread to close and have you had conversations with the regulators of them feeling comfortable with that closure and then i just have a followup thanks so much brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks dominick i dont think weve had a conversation with regard to the product private label versus general purpose i think they look at the loss scenarios that we run right the stress scenarios that we run we are have a very unique feature in the rsas which provide a buffer against some of the outlays so i think when you look at the output of those we dont really view it differently than some of our competitors when you think about a capital one for argument sake with regard to how their stress capital buffer comes out so were in line with those its not really productoriented and most certainly for us as we have those conversations really demonstrating to them the resiliency of this business and this customer because of the point of origination we actually get stronger yields and riskadjusted returns off and again when you combine that with the rsa buffer it provides particular strength when it comes to having a lower capital ratio and those are the conversations were having with them dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc makes a lot of sense i would argue you should be below the general purpose players to some extent because of all those factors on a riskadjusted basis and then if you think about the efficiency of the business as we move forward theres obviously going to be some pressure from multiple factors on the loan book and obviously you could see some good cycle growth given some of the tailwinds of the overall economy but when we think of gap when we think about all the various factors of the size of your loan book how do you think about the long term efficiency of the business moving forward over the next few years is there some pressure on efficiency until you get back to maybe your more traditional average loan book size and is there some dynamics between the carecredit and the retail card there thanks so much i really appreciate being on the call thank you brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial officer synchrony financial thanks dominick so i think the way to think about efficiency is when we went through last year we underwent a strategic outlook that said if i look out to think about the mix of business im going to have think about trying to be a top roa profile company and i look at the revenue characteristics the loss content characteristics the rsa characteristics what is my expense and efficiency ratio have to be in order to be a top tier roa and ahead of all of our peers to really generate the investment thesis we then rolled that back into the plans that we put in place in the latter part of so i think weve engaged upon that part of thats delivering over million of benefit this year from a cost out perspective i think the greater pressure on the efficiency ratio in the shortterm to be honest with you is the revenue headwind that we have with the net interest margin and nii have been a little bit impacted or being impacted by stimulus and really terrific credit and late fee impact that comes from that thats a little bit ahead but i do think youre going to see this this business model right were built off of a foundation of running expenses at a very synchrony financial syf corrected transcript q1 earnings call 27apr2021 manageable level given the loan balance size i think as you see carecredit our business grow you should be able to get operating leverage because they run at higher average balances if you think about the bigger ticket size associated with those accounts and then what cant be lost is the fact that we dont have to spend as much on marketing as our peers relative to generate those new accounts so we are an industry probably best or very attractive cost to acquire customers which really puts us at a competitive advantage versus our peers so we will tightly manage the efficiency and while were doing this were going to continue to invest in the future the digital assets that we put in play over the last several years were going to continue to invest for our long term future so its a combination of investing and really having a business model and set of partners where we can leverage it and generate that operating efficiencies we probably grow above average with peers and have a higher return than average versus our peers thats how i would think about it dominick dominick gabriele q director senior analyst oppenheimer co inc all right great thanks so much i really appreciate it brian j wenzel sr a executive vice president chief financial
