weve seen a nice pickup in fixed income in both taxable and tax exempt and this level of performance is reflected in the or morningstar funds we offer globally with regard to flows in the quarter net outflows improved yearoveryear to billion which included about million of outflows from legacy insurance partners retail and model delivery net outflows were better at billion due to improved gross sales in both north america and emea as well as net inflows into etfs and model delivery we continue to evolve how we deliver our investment capabilities and over the last few years we have successfully built out our sma businesses with both traditional and taxefficient strategies and we are a top player in model delivery weve also been building out our etf business just added four active etfs to leverage our investment strength in equity income and credit were beginning to gain a good level of flows in these areas and well look to further expand our product line over time and in institutional excluding legacy insurance partners flows were flat in the quarter as we discussed the team is very focused on positioning the business for future growth were driving operational improvements and making necessary adjustments that include streamlining the organization in particular in the emea region in addition were improving and better leveraging our processes and technology systems globally were redeploying these savings to invest in the areas that will drive profitable growth ultimately were focused on better positioning asset management to adapt to changing market dynamics you can see some of the benefits in our results for the quarter that we will build upon next year bringing things back to the firm level ameriprise continues to consistently generate strong results our longterm record is excellent as an example just looking back over the last five years weve delivered compound annual growth in eps and return on equity consistently among the highest in the industry and our balance sheet remains a clear and important differentiator were proud of the level and consistency of our results that reflect the unique combination of capabilities that we have across ameriprise and the operating leverage and benefits that result from our teams working together firm wide are key to delivering our excellent client value proposition we are one firm using the strength and activities of the business working together and thats reflected in the consistency of the results weve delivered before i close youve asked about longterm care and whether theres an opportunity to do a risk transfer at this time based on market changes we thoroughly reviewed our options and believe that keeping the book at this time is in the best interest of shareholders walter will discuss this in more detail in closing last quarter we shared that ameriprise recognized years in business how we manage the firm is key to our longevity and legacy ameriprise regularly earns awards in the marketplace for our culture and how we operate including being recognized among the best managed companies on the wall street journal management top list forbes magazine named us as one of americas best large employers and ameriprise has also been ranked as one of americas greatest workplaces for women by newsweek ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 we also earn excellent recognition with our people internally yearafteryear and our annual engagement scores that we received in the quarter continue to exceed external benchmarks across industries across ameriprise were focused on serving clients well as we continue to build invest in and take the business forward ill now ask walter to provide his perspective in more detail on the quarter and then well take your questions walter s berman executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc thank you jim the diversified nature of our business and unique leverage points between them drives our strong consistent profitable growth and ability to navigate stress events adjusted operating eps increased to excluding unlocking and severance expense associated with the companys initiatives to enhance operating efficiencies and effectiveness to further strengthen the client experience and future shareholder value in addition to the severance costs we recognized additional expense of per share related severance program expenses and acceleration of the firms transition to cloudbased technology platforms higher compensation accruals relating to strong performance and marktomarket impacts on sharebased compensation this further demonstrates the strong underlying growth achieved in the quarter assets under management and administration increased to trillion benefiting from strong client flows over the past year and equity market appreciation this has resulted in strong revenue growth across our businesses ga expenses continued to be wellmanaged and demonstrate our focus on operational efficiency and effectiveness we continue to invest in areas that will drive future business growth particularly in wealth management while maintaining expense discipline to achieve shareholder objectives our returns remained strong with a consolidated margin of excluding unlocking and severance expenses and a bestinclass return on equity of balance sheet fundamentals including excess capital and liquidity are very strong our diversified business model benefits from significant and stable free cash flow contributions across all business segments we returned million of capital to shareholders in the quarter in we continue to expect to return of operating earnings to shareholders on slide you will see our integrated model leverages key business linkages to drive strong and consistent operating performance our business model is a key driver of profitable growth for our shareholders across market cycles ameriprise is one company with three business segments from which we gain leverage for the whole for example within our open network in wealth management columbia threadneedle and riversource provide important solutions to awm clients these relationships result in high levels of advisor and client satisfaction and retention another example is where we are able to leverage our asset management expertise at columbia threadneedle to manage the general and separate account assets for riversource the bank and certificate company and they have delivered highquality returns with strong credit performance ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 these segments benefit from the leverage of our corporate functions and capabilities which include technology ameriprise india and staff groups these capabilities enhance our ability to meet client needs in an efficient manner while driving growth and consistency across market cycles on slide you see the strong results from wealth management total client assets grew to an alltime high of trillion with wrap assets up to billion from strong net flows and market appreciation over the past year wrap flows were strong in the quarter at billion or on an annualized flow rate pretax adjusted operating earnings increased to million driven by quite strong yearoveryear core wealth management earnings growth offset by lower cash sweep earnings and margin remained strong at adjusted operating net revenues increased to billion from growth in client assets increased transactional activity and a increase in net investment income in the bank this drove revenue per advisors to a new high of up from a year ago total cash balances including thirdparty money market funds and broker cds was billion which was over of the clients assets clients remain heavily concentrated in yieldoriented products with highly liquid products like money market funds being more in favor than the term products like certificates and brokered cds we are beginning to see clients put more money back to work in wrap and other products on our platform and we expect this to continue over time as markets and rates normalize which creates a significant opportunity client cash sweep balances were stable at approximately billion bank assets grew to billion providing sustainable net investment income in this forecasted lower rate environment these trends continued in october adjusted operating expenses in the quarter increased with distribution expenses up reflecting business growth and increased transactional activity ga expenses were flat at million with higher volume related expenses in the current quarter and a regulatory accrual in the prior year quarter excluding the regulatory accrual in the yearago period ga expenses were up in the quarter consistent with expectations turning to asset management on slide financial results were very strong in the quarter the aum increased to billion primarily from higher equity market appreciation in the quarter operating earnings were quite strong and increased to million and our margin reached adjusted operating expenses increased with ga expenses improving from a year ago reflecting initial benefits from the companys initiatives to enhance operational effectiveness and efficiency to further enhance our ability to meet clients needs lets turn to slide retirement protection solutions continued to deliver good earnings and free cash flow generation reflecting the high quality of the business that has been built over a long period of time pretax adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking in the quarter increased to million reflecting the benefit from strong markets and higher interest rates partially offset by higher distribution expenses associated with strong sales levels yeartodate pretax adjusted operating earnings excluding unlocking were million which is on pace with our expected level of approximately million on an annual pretax basis ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 we completed our annual actuary assumption update in the quarter resulting in an unfavorable pretax impact of million primarily related to updates to persistency assumptions for variable annuities our lapse assumptions is now aligned with recent experience and we are very comfortable with this level overall retirement protective solutions sales improved in the quarter with protection sales up to million primarily in highermargin vul products variable annuity sales grew to billion with strong momentum in our structured product turning to the balance sheet on slide balance sheet fundamentals and free cash flow generation remained strong with billion of excess capital we have diversified sources of dividends from all our businesses enabled by strong underlying fundamentals this supports our ability to consistently return capital to shareholders and invest for future business growth ameriprises consistent capital return strategy drives longterm shareholder value in summary on slide ameriprise delivered excellent growth in the third quarter which is a continuation of our long track record to outperform our stated financial targets over the last months revenues grew earnings per share increased return on equity grew basis points excluding unlocking and we returned billion of capital to shareholders we had similar growth trends over the past five years with of revenue growth eps compounded annual growth return on equity improved nearly percentage points and we returned billion of capital to shareholders these trends are consistent over the longer term as well compared to most financial services companies this differentiated performance across multiple cycles speaks to the complementary nature of our business mix as well as our focus on profitable growth before we move to qa let me provide some additional insight into our decision to retain longterm care on slide as you are aware we have been in the process of assessing potential risk transfer opportunities related to longterm care in the quarter we completed this analysis and have concluded that retaining the business is in the best interest of our shareholders our analysis found that there is a substantial difference in value between retaining the block and reinsuring the block our assessment concluded that the market for standalone longterm care risk transfer deals has not matured and that highquality blocks like ours are not receiving an appropriate level of differentiation by counterparties our transaction will require us to include other books of business that would transfer tremendous value to a counterparty to offset unwarranted discounts applied to ltc let me be clear we feel very good about the quality of our longterm care business and it has performed better than our expectations over the past several years which we expect to continue going forward as you have seen the business has generated million of statutory earnings over the past five years and that trend should continue we have already seen the size of the book declined by with over terminating without a claim this business will continue to run off with over twothirds of the remaining book expected to run ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 off over the next years this extensive experience has supported our reserve process and that process has proven very accurate we will also be able to capture additional upside from future enhancements related to investment portfolio repositioning premium rate increases and other program actions to improve performance we will maintain a strong and differentiated capital position and we do not need to supplement our capital position with a reinsurance transaction in summary given the high quality of our block with million of capital as well as our credible experience and confidence in our reserves we do not believe there is a plausible scenario that could justify executing a risk transfer deal at these levels and taking on additional counterparty exposure in closing we had an excellent quarter and feel good about how we are positioned going forward with that well take your questions question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions well take our first question from suneet kamath at jefferies suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning i wanted to start with the retail flows in asset management i guess is there it was interesting you have that slide that talks about the synergies across businesses so i guess my question is is there anything that youre doing strategically structurally within asset management and advice wealth management to take advantage of the fact that you have these two businesses in terms of improving the flow outlook and if you could give some examples that would be helpful as well james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes suneet this is jim so as you saw and walter presented in the slide the awm business is a large distribution partner for colombia theyve established that over many years even in our open architecture and they are a valued partner and in that regard as we focus more on growing our thirdparty distribution globally and as well as institutional we havent put as much of focus as we used to on the awm business and i think there is an opportunity that ted and team are working on now to bring more product in to gear some of that product especially for the type of solutions that we need and we actually think that there is a great opportunity for him to increase his activity within the channel again and so hes working on a combination of current solutions that he has as well as bringing other solutions to bear that we think can go on a flows within the channel suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay and then just on the comment that you made about client cash moving into money market funds as opposed to the term products what is your read in terms of whats going on there is it that the advisors are sort of positioning for a rotation into these other longer duration sort of wealth wrap products or who do you think is going on thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so we saw like a increase into wrap flows again in diversified portfolios which includes fixed income and so its a nice rebalancing occurring there and flow increase and so what we did see just more broadly is a move out of brokered cds and certificates even though the cash levels didnt go down in total it moved into money markets and what that says is really that people arent going to are locking less up into these what i would call just pure interest earning assets and into vehicles that then they could possibly move back into things like wrap or other fixed income products that have longer duration suneet kamath q analyst jefferies llc got it okay thanks operator well go next to alex blostein at goldman sachs alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey everybody good morning thank you for the question i was hoping you guys could talk about your outlook for cash revenues within awm in totality so i know in the past you kind of referred to bank more on a standalone basis and jim you made some comments earlier this morning regarding kind of ways you could still aim to kind of keep nii stable to growing within the bank but maybe just expand that a little bit and we think about the certs business the bank the brokerdealer or the thirdparty like kind of putting it together given the forward curve trajectory and current cash balances what are your thoughts for the revenue trends there for walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well as i indicated its walter for the bank yes on the revenue trends and the net interest income we do see that is going to be stable or actually increase and we feel very good about that positioning we do see as jim mentioned certainly were hoping that money will stop moving and we believe it will from the third party money market and thirdparty cds and we are probably youll see some continued softening in cds depending on again how drastic the rate is but overall i think the bulk of our earnings coming from the will be from the bank and certainly sweep will be impacted as the rates come down but the and the certs but and then hope we will get that rotation out of the money market and thirdparty cds to go back into product james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and alex from the bank perspective we will be launching bank cds that would be another cash alternative where clients are holding cash out in the banks well be offering a fixed loan pledge this quarter well also be launching helocs at the beginning of next year and putting in checking accounts later in the year so again that could ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 bring more cash activities from current bank accounts that our clients are holding to having more cash here as well that they can utilize or save so those things again will be gradual builds but i think theyll be nice and complementary and we think we can garner both savings as well as lending activities from our clients because we know they have a lot out there and they have a lot of lending and loan books that we can take in alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc i got you that makes sense thanks guys for that for my followup i wanted to spend a minute on the asset management business margins and the ga expense trajectory there so you guys are on track i think for a second year in a row of declining expenses in that business speaking to the efficiencies obviously that you talked about despite record market and your record aum levels pushing margins i think to plus now how sustainable do you think this level of profitability is in this segment maybe give us a sense of how you think the additional efficiencies you still expect in that business to impact the ga dollars in that segment over the next call it several quarters to a year walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc sure again its walter so looking at the actions we take on transformation and the impact its had in we certainly see that will continue in and now again i cant predict where the markets will be but based on our controllables that weve taken action on and improve the and at the same time improve our client servicing with i think you could see margins certainly stay with a good market staying at the levels probably be in the to range for sure alexander blostein q analyst goldman sachs co llc all right thank you operator well move next to wilma burdis at raymond james wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning i guess you guys are on track for kind of capital return this year can you walk us through how you think about that level for and beyond thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well right now were talking for that well be at and we believe based on certainly as we project the market and everything that probably is a good number that you should use for next year james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you and then as james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc we have a good capital position the excess has built up again and so we have flexibility as we go into depending on market circumstances and other opportunities wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you and then what would you consider a good run rate for corporate expenses i think it was you guys previously said around million to million but it sounds like theres some cloud conversion and some other little things so maybe just talk a little bit about that thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so as weve gone through it obviously the severance which we probably should end on indiscernible we have no later than the first quarter and weve made our investments in the cloud and our mainframes to improve on that once we and that should last probably in over two quarters maybe three but we should return to the probably the million range and you should assume in that once we get through that wilma burdis q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thank you operator well go next to steven chubak at wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning jim and walter wanted to start off with a question on the expense outlook just imagine youre already thinking through the budgeting process for next year i was hoping you could offer a bit of a sneakpeek just on how we should be thinking about the ga growth outlook as well as both at the awm enterprise level and just given some signs that flows are inflecting in awm are you looking to ramp up investment versus that current baseline walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well on the flows list i think were following what the industry are the good news is on the wrap as jim has indicated but on the expenses probably a good gauge again like i mentioned the severance and the investment were making in the cloud its probably in that flattish range and probably again with the growth investment in awm probably in the to range is a good thinking steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 and at the enterprise level just more broadly walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc enterprise will be probably closer to flat again talking about were talking now mentioning excluding the severance aspect and the investment in the cloud but in that range steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc got it and just for a followup on the competitive landscape in awm i know thats something that you have flagged just as a source of pressure on flow trends its certainly nice to see some inflection in the quarter just hoping you could just offer some perspective on the competitive landscape cost to acquire sas as rates have risen weve certainly seen ta rates move higher commensurate with that i want to get your perspective just on the cost to acquire do you expect that to come down as rates decline do you anticipate thats going to be a potential tailwind to recruiting activity looking on to next year james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so i would probably say yes with the extra spread i think people are utilizing and some people to actually goose up their packages et cetera and i think its a bit frothy i think as that starts to temper i think youll maybe see some adjustment in what people may be doing from our perspective we continue to get good quality people the books are a little larger even though the number of count has come down and we feel good about what were doing and how were doing it but i do believe that with the markets and other things that people are paying up a bit more today than maybe is appropriate steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc thats helpful perspective thanks so much for taking my questions operator our next question comes from craig siegenthaler at bank of america craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thanks good morning everyone so my first question is on the recruiting front so the advisor count declined in the quarter but given that retention levels look pretty strong and you felt good with the advisor additions can you talk about what drove the sequential decline and if you expect advisor growth to reaccelerate in james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah we think that the advisor growth will get back to the track we had some additional and as we continue to work through productivity some lower fas on the teams and some turnover in the afa things as advisors start to adjust their practices a bit more but theres nothing major or abnormal there that we see ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc got it and then i want to come back to the longterm care book commentary and how your view of value differs in the private markets so im curious like what type of entities are or would bid for reinsuring or acquiring other longterm care block and how robust is the market for longterm care today i cant see many public insurers bidding for that and does that market include alternative asset manager models private insurers and public life insurers walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well i can only comment what weve been exposed to so again its as we indicated we went through discussions with certainly reinsurers that are well known and weve evaluated on both fronts as i indicated looking at ltc first looking at both and then looking at ltc alone i can just say for it is its not a mature market and certainly were seeing from that standpoint the results that we have engaged with that its just not beneficial so i am not going to comment on the depth of the market its the ones that we dealt with are certainly are well known in the industry and we just dont see the value creation james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah there are some private equity type partners et cetera firms but they partner with reinsurers the reinsurance market is not very large for this book these type of books and theyre applying a very large gross discount because it is very immature that its not their core type of business and they do want to match it up with good other quality books that would you would have to give up good earnings for and when you put it together it looks really more positive but its the proceeds rather than the actual underneath and from that dont get me wrong theres an opportunity that people need capital or if they have to want to trade off those things from my perspective our value is there they even admitted that we wouldnt necessarily look to make sense for us at this point based on that market and we feel very good about maintaining it based on our results and our track record craig siegenthaler q analyst bofa securities inc thank you operator well go next to thomas gallagher at evercore isi thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc good morning hey just first a followup on longterm care i hear what youre saying on the bidask particularly given that its profitable for you but just out of curiosity there was a precedent transaction manulife did a deal that was according to them a negative fee so they had to pay money to get rid of it is that sort of a line in the sand that you wouldnt be willing to go for like absorbing a loss or a standalone ltc far worse than that i just want to get a sense for your perception of what price was too high for you because i do think from a management distraction standpoint if it was a modest loss that might still be a reasonable tradeoff ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc tom let me try and address it this way when weve analyzed our book were not talking about a loss were talking about all factors consider its contributing right and we feel very confident in that obviously reinsurers have different objective sets which again would certainly work for them but not for us but the starting point is the value of our book is not a distraction its actually very additive to our shareholder value at this stage and certainly we feel confident in our ability to manage it and weve been managing it for years and as weve certainly gone over and discussed over many years and youve seen the results of it so we feel confident its positive for us and that it created a negative with the reinsurance approach and so thats where were basically positioning right now james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and tom youre asking a very good question from our perspective not only wrong we looked at the whether there was an opportunity to do this because we know its always a question you and others have and to be very honest with you as i looked and even challenged to do something like this the difference in value was just too large the book is a very mature book it does not require a lot of management to extract we have the resources as far as managing the rest of the life company weve been able to take good rate were adjusting how we even handle claims that we think will be greater efficiencies going forward the book is running off its very mature even when originally some of these concerns with some other books ive heard a number of years ago there was a question our book showed improvement we actually even built discretionary reserves that we have not taken back and have flexibility on so what im just driving that is what you would have to give up on earning books on the life business as an offset that would take future earnings out in combinations to our earning on this book plus the idea that they will take more gross discounts because its not a market that they have a lot in it and theyll do it as an accommodation so to speak against other books it just doesnt make sense for us maybe some others it does for what they need is what they how theyre thinking about it but if i had any concern about whats in that book or that there would be any potential impact i would handle that and but even if there were minor things it will be over time very small against what we do and what we have so i really dont think its an issue that shareholders have to worry about walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah the only thing i would add to that is just and then of course weve been taking on counterparty exposure which is not even into the formula so all things considered as jim said makes sense and high confidence bases still retain thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 no that all makes sense to me everything has a price but yeah i particularly given that its profitable and you probably have a release of capital in addition to that when you think about future cash flows that all makes sense just one quick followup i think the increase in excess capital was pretty sizable this quarter i think it went up by million was there anything unusual going on that drove that this quarter walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no the only other thing is again we paid out at million certainly has indiscernible earnings so that was the major contributor to it that was ins and outs but really its on very sound footing and we feel theres nothing really unique in there it certainly track the way we thought james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah were generating the million weve paid out the million and again it gives us flexibility as we move forward thomas gallagher q analyst evercore group llc great thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc thank you operator well take our next question from kenneth lee at rbc capital markets kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for taking my question and good morning just one quick followup on the ltc block here im curious if a meaningful change in the rate environment could change your thinking down the line thanks walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc no weve certainly invested out where right now where the books are hitting their level where certainly well go into more payout on that basis so we feel very good about that and we took advantage of that so no the answer is no kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc okay great very helpful there and one quick followup on the integrated model slide that you have there between asset management advice wealth management and the riversource there is there any expectation that longer term you could potentially see more synergies for example between the various insurance products and the asset management side perhaps even augmenting some of the asset management capabilities over time to better capture that just curious in terms of your thinking of that thanks ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yeah and so part of what people dont really understand and thats really the nature of the company because everyone breaks it down to a segment but if you look at the type of relationships we have with the client the solutions that we provide and how we manage those assets on that behalf is all leverage together in a positive way and so from that we have a very strong return because of that depth of the relationship and how we use those type of capabilities so the asset management capabilities how we hedge all those things are part of what walters from a corporate does as well as with the riversource business management of the assets including the bank right now are run by the fixed income department of colombia and so all those capabilities are there and colombia gets management fees the riversource company gets the benefit of those capabilities rather than sending them out to other players they manage indiscernible portfolios they manage our epn and all the asset of rollups and balancing on those different asset allocation models and the awm gets the benefit of a good solution with a good benefit at a very good price because of the synergies that we can put to bear there so for us thats why theres a real complementary nature rather than just the separate little distinct businesses and remember the asset management business grew out of being a proprietary manager for ameriprise as the awm resource and solution set in fact the distribution was actually the distribution for the product manufacturers and i turned that into a wealth manager that really lives and breathes on its own but the solution sets embedded or complement even in an open architecture that we have kenneth lee q analyst rbc capital markets llc got you very helpful there thanks again operator well go next to ryan krueger at kbw ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning i had a couple of followups one walter when you said you expected total company ga expenses to be flattish was that a comment or is that a comment walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc that was a comment but it actually for its going to be the same pretty much ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then i guess when we think about is that on a headline basis flat including that includes the severance costs and other things like that walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 well in yes that was including the severance but in there will be some severance but it will be at a lower level then i anticipate it will be at a lower level but those numbers again thats why im hedging a little because it but in the main it should be in that range ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay and then just coming back to the just wanted to come back to the bank i believe about a third of the assets are floating rate so i would think with shortterm rates coming down and expected to come down further there would at least be some pressure on the spread income from the bank is the offset just growing the assets or can you talk a little bit more what makes you feel confident that it can still be stable walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc well it will come down but yes weve repositioned the book and weve recently repositioned the book with a longterm its duration is saying over three and from that standpoint so yes it will come down but the what were on the floating were earning a pretty large premium on so it will still preserve itself and i think we like i said we will our net interest income should be higher i mean well get ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great thank you walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc certainly maturities coming through and we will be adding to it ryan krueger q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thanks operator well move next to michael cyprys at morgan stanley michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning thanks for taking the question just coming back to the billion excess capital position available for deployment i imagine that continues to build if the expectation is that youll pay out of earnings so maybe you could speak to some of the priorities for how youre thinking about potentially deploying that excess over what period of time whats the sort of appetite to sit with that excess capital position for how long and maybe you could comment on some of the strategic type of ma conversations youre having and where ma could be most additive to the business today james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 have a lot of parts to that question so what we have done really is we were going through this market cycle not knowing exactly the environment we feel like actually were one of the highest returns out there compared to anybody today and is a substantial amount what weve just done is looked at the environment we replenished some of the excess capital at a level we have the alternative as we move into of whether we if the market environment is good whether we take up that buyback a bit more whether we look at some opportunities depending on what happens in the market and values for inorganic or we will further look at how we adjust the business and redeploy in other ways so it gives us a good level of flexibility but were not at a low level of return and so lets look at it as an opportunity and then we can decide how we utilize it based on a combination of factors including the environment walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yeah so the only thing i would add is obviously to the previous quarters well increase the bank which obviously will require capital were certainly investing as weve incurred million of severance and also probably million million of additional expense to drive that so thats investments which well get paid back for from that standpoint and we are also investing in seed as jim has mentioned the asset management is certainly launching multiple products and so theres investments being made even though were growing the excess and well just keep on evaluating that as we deploy michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc great and then just a bigger picture followup question just as we think about longevity trends people living longer concerns that people may outlive their nest eggs just curious how you see the opportunity set for your integrated business how your product set might evolve and change to better address the accumulation needs from an aging population and how the client experience may also continue to evolve james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc excellent question we have a number of new product initiatives and solutions underway that we think will both help our advisors to manage the totality of their portfolios with clients offering a lot more flexibility in how they manage reallocate balance et cetera we are in the process of developing products for the longevity to your point for retirement income and how they will draw down and what gives them the optimal formula for that and again those will come from the combination of our capabilities that we have and the knowledge we have with the relationships with our clients so those are actually things that were investing in that were developing and well come to market with over the next year or so so i think there will be good opportunity based on how we actually go to market with the advice value proposition and the solution set and how we look at the clients life goals and as well as factor in their longevity what they need to accumulate whats probably from a qualified and qualified as well as from a tax benefit for how they can draw down michael j cyprys q analyst morgan stanley co llc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 great thank you operator next well go to john barnidge at piper sandler john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co good morning thank you for the opportunity appreciate the slides on the risk transfer analysis in the presentation my question is focused there when you talk about with coupling other business did that consider a full sale of riversource within that analysis or was it limited to liabilities in the corporate segment only walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc the analysis that we get on longterm care that was only for a reinsurance of longterm care indiscernible james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and it was again it would have included or thought about some transfer on the life books walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc yes but those all were basically reinsurance transaction john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thats helpful thank you and then my followup can you talk about the directionality of distribution expense in awm with the rate cycle having changed and expected maybe shifting in products over the near and intermediate term thank you james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc so from a distribution expense really embedded in our ga is the actually volume increases including where we run smas and pay for asset managers and other things so thats all in the ga so if we strip that out ga is actually quite good flat so the volume increases are in the ga including things like fdic insurance i mean you name it so what i would probably say is we feel very good about the ga based on what weve made as adjustments that includes that we are reinvesting nicely in solution set in capability and technology et cetera so weve been able to actually redeploy reengineer transform in a sense of how were using technology ai analytics et cetera robotics use of indiscernible et cetera so were very active in what were doing so that we continue to make good investments and maintain good margins john barnidge q analyst piper sandler co thank you ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 operator well take our last question from brennan hawken at ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc sneaking in under the wire thanks for taking my questions this morning so a couple of questions thinking about the bank so when i think about ways to protect spread regardless of the rate environment i often think of lending and weve seen other wealth management firms note a pickup and particularly the pledge loan product with rates coming down we know that youve seen some decent growth in pledge loans since they bottomed in mid2023 but have you seen an acceleration and engagement in that product since the fed cut rates recently and should we also continue to expect the strong resi mortgage growth that youve been seeing in recent quarters to continue james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc yes so we do see a nice pickup in pledge we are launching even a fixed pledge product in complement to what we had which we also know was our advisors were asking for and thats out in the marketplace and a good portion of whats done in the business we know that this was a new business for us and were underpenetrated compared to others that have those products and solutions and so we think that that can continue to further expand we will be launching helocs next year and we think theres a good opportunity years ago when we had the bank we launched helocs we built a nice portfolio in that so we think we can continue to do that were actually working with another provider of mortgages that were transferring that we think again that could further expand so there are a number of things that we feel good about to grow the lending part of the book brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that yeah i remember your comments on the new products helpful okay for my second question just basically closing out with one final one here on the longterm care decision so id like to take a different perspective here the business model that you guys have is different than other wealth management firms and that you have this insurance business and from my perspective and talking with capital market investors the insurance business is not one where theyre focused on the return profile or the cash flows or whatever its very often an obstacle to buy the stock and so what i would say and ask intended in utterly the most respectful way is whether or not you considered the idea that eating a bit of a loss on this and sure you got to take some counterparty risk correspondingly but it reduces what can be a hurdle to a lot of investors when they consider investing in ameriprise versus considering other wealth management firms for example raymond james lpl stifel that might have different risks but they are lacking this longterm care book that is so challenging and while i get it yours is the best house it is still a really bad block so how did that come into the equation and the mathematics behind that consideration thanks james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 so very clearly i think again and thats maybe what is not fully understood so at ameriprise as you look at the total of the company and weve looked at this since weve been public we have been the bestperforming shareholder return in financials of the sp we have over all these cycles including through financial crisis outperformed any segment individual asset managers individual wealth managers individual life companies you put it all together you get a very strong consistent return at lower volatility in addition to that our insurance businesses that generate over million of free cash flow every year used to buy back stock has not been in any way a hurt or hindrance or a roadblock to generate good returns in addition to that its a very clear and appropriate solution for our client that actually keeps good retention of the client and even where you would say okay longterm care is not a good segment of it we closed that book over years ago roughly its a mature book its generating value and having said that theres only million of capital to it okay and we have extra discretionary that came up through the combination over the last few years so what i would just say is if someone is looking at that as a hindrance let me just go you have some pressure in markets you have some pressure in interest rates et cetera from where it is wealth managers arent going to hurt were not going to hurt as a company were going to outperform so i would just say youve got a strong growth business high returns youve got a return on equity compare it to some of your wealth managers that youre talking about look at taking cash spread around away and see what you get so i would say i would probably have that discussion with your investors and im happy to do it personally walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc its walter let me what you started your premise on was exactly the basis in which we entered into the evaluation about the drag that would have on potential shareholder reaction so we looked at every aspect knowing that factor and all the elements that i listed in the presentation and evaluating that bidask and the fact these are our clients and the counterparty exposures that are created which again certainly is an issue that we have to consider we could not in clear conscience really take an action that of course in every aspect we analyze it would denigrate shareholder value in the long run it really would james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc let me add one other thing we didnt do this on our own we worked with very wellknown bankers i wont mention their names number of firms and i will tell you that was their also recommendation that we keep it compared to what it is whats out there and from a shareholder perspective indiscernible because ive asked those questions explicitly brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc got it james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc hopefully that answers your question brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc it does i didnt mean to kick the hornets nest right with the last question on the call but there we go ameriprise financial inc amp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 24oct2024 james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc indiscernible i think honestly we understand that perceived but i would just ask people to look through the perceived through the reality of it and to be very honest i am here to generate excellent returns for shareholders im here to keep my people highly engaged and give them an opportunity and im here for my clients and so i years i dont take lightly ive been running the company for over now and ive done everything in that regard not for the idea that i have invested opinion on something that i would not challenge walter s berman a executive vice president chief financial officer ameriprise financial inc so the only thing ill add what your premise was is certainly valid but when we look at auto and home and we disposed of that we did our fixed annuity we went in on the premise of ensuring shareholder value so we have certainly taken risk off this is one when analyzing it made no sense to do james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc and let me if the market matures in a way or theres more of an appetite from reinsurers walter and i will be the first one that will evaluate that for an opportunity i will look strategically at the business and i do that every year every quarter so im not fighting you ive asked the same questions im challenged with the same but i would just tell you im not making this decision because i dont think its the right decision to make im making it because i think it is the right decision at this juncture at this time brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc yeah thanks that was the spirit of the question and i think you addressed it thoroughly so thanks for sharing your thoughts on that james m cracchiolo a chairman chief executive officer ameriprise financial inc i appreciate it thank you operator and we have no further questions at this time this concludes todays conference thank
