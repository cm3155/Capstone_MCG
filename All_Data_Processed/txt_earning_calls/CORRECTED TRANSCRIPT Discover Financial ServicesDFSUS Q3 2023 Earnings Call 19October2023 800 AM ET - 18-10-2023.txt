sustainable longterm financial performance i will now hand the call off to john to review our results in more detail john t greene executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services thank you john and good morning everyone ill start with our financial summary results on slide in the quarter we reported net income of million down from just over billion in the prior year quarter provision expense grew by million reflecting an increase in reserves and chargeoffs strong loan growth along with changing macroeconomic and household liquidity conditions drove the increase to our reserve balance chargeoffs increased due to portfolio seasoning and remain in line with expectations revenue grew deposits grew and expenses increased yearoveryear further details are reflected on slide net interest income was up million yearoveryear or our net interest margin ended the quarter at down basis points from the prior year and down basis points sequentially this decrease was driven by higher funding costs which were partially offset by the benefits from higher prime rates receivable growth was robust card increased yearoveryear reflecting new account growth in a lower payment rate versus the prior year the payment rate declined about basis points quarteroverquarter but remains just under basis points above levels sales volume was relatively flat for the quarter personal loans were up driven by strength in originations over the past year and lower payment rates we continue to experience strong consumer demand while staying disciplined in our underwriting student loans were up deposit growth in the quarter was solid with average consumer deposits up yearoveryear and sequentially our directtoconsumer balances grew billion looking at other revenue on slide noninterest income increased million or this was primarily driven by higher transaction processing revenue from our pulse business an increase in loan fee income and strong net discount and interchange revenue discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 moving to expenses on slide total operating expenses were up million or yearoveryear and up from the prior quarter this increase is driven primarily by investments in our compliance and risk management programs and is reflected across several of our expense line items looking at our major expense categories compensation costs were up million or primarily from increased head count the increase in information processing expense was driven by software licensing renewals professional fees reflect an increase in thirdparty support as we focus on accelerating our compliance and risk management efforts moving to credit performance on slide total net chargeoffs were basis points higher than the prior year and up basis points from the prior quarter in card we continue to see the effects of seasoning of newer accounts which have higher delinquency rates than older vintages losses remain consistent with targeted ranges these newer vintages support strong longterm profitability turning to the allowance for credit losses on slide this quarter we increased our reserves by million and our reserve rate increased by basis points to just over the reserve increase reflects a modest deteriorating macroeconomic outlook increasing delinquencies and higher loan balances our macro assumptions reflect a relatively strong labor market but also consumer headwinds from declining savings rates and increasing debt burdens looking at slide our common equity tier for the period was the sequential decline of basis points was driven largely by our strong organic asset growth we declared a quarterly cash dividend of per share of common stock concluding on slide with our outlook we now expect our loan growth to be in the mid teens as declining payment rates are offsetting the impact of slowing sales there is no change to our nim expectations to be approximately for the full year were maintaining our expectations for operating expenses to be up low double digits and there is no change to our expected range for net chargeoffs to be between and for the year in conclusion our business fundamentals remain strong we continue to generate solid financial results while building out our compliance and risk management capabilities and prudently investing in actions that drive sustainable longterm performance with that ill turn the call back to our operator to open the line for qa discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 question and answer section operator operator instructions and well take our first question from sanjay sakhrani with kbw your line is open sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning just wanted to get a little bit more on the reserve build as we look ahead john greene could you just talk about like how we should think about that reserve rate increasing from here because obviously you made some adjustments but youve said the credit numbers are performing pretty consistent with your expectations so is it a reflection on how you see things unfolding next year maybe you can just talk about the relation and how we should think about that reserve coverage on a goforward basis assuming the unemployment assumptions dont change much john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah thanks sanjay i appreciate the question so let me back up and just give a little bit of overview in terms of what happened in the quarter and why we increased the reserve rate so as we took a look at through the portfolio performance and the loan growth obviously we had to make reserve build for loan growth and that represented about of the million the other or approximately million reflected our view on the macros now while the unemployment numbers remain relatively in line and strong by historical standards we are seeing some indications of stress and if we go back to the pandemic and learnings there we found that certainly unemployment remains an important factor in terms of reserves but theres other factors and what weve done over the past years try to build into those other factors into our loss models and reserve models and weve done that so as we took a look at household net worth and savings rate both have deteriorated and were seeing deterioration more specifically in lower fico bands so we use those macro factors in order to capture loss content that we felt was appropriate from a reserving standpoint so as we look at reserve levels today and into the future theres a couple of things that ill say are just kind of general process items first itll be dependent on the macro views and whether they remain stable or deteriorating second certainly the portfolio performance will be a very very important factor and then third will be the timing and trajectory of loss content so as losses become closer in terms of our projection period theyre probability adjusted and therefore could increase reserve rate now theres a lot of detail that i just provided so let me give a view of our expectations so first the portfolio is performing generally well although we are seeing mildly increased stress at the lower fico bands to mid fico bands were also seeing that vintage performed slightly worse than although highly profitable so as we look forward to well run our process and adjust the reserve as we deem most appropriate an important piece will also be the chargeoff trajectory so what weve said previously is we expect chargeoffs to peak sometime around the midpoint of the year to the second half of the year second half of so if we dont see a slowing in delinquency rates between now and first quarter certainly that could be an indication that discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 well have to take incremental provisions so a lot there hopefully enough for you to be able to digest and move forward with sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc yeah thank you thats great and just under the banner of sort of regulatory stuff question number one it doesnt seem like theres a whole lot to update in terms of other actions we obviously got the consent order and then i saw in the perspective for you still have a pause for the capital management piece not any change to that so could you just give us a sense of sort of how to think about that unpausing of the share repurchase i know john owen mentioned it might take several quarters to resolve the merchant issue so just trying to reconcile those comments thanks john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services sure yeah ill take that one too sanjay so let me first start out by saying our capital allocation priorities arent changed so invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders thats very clear from our business model our management team and our board the second piece to the answer relates to our continued work on the card tiering issue and other governance issues so were making reasonably good progress on both of those and what well do as part of our planning process well make a recommendation to the board regarding our capital actions and specifically the buyback and then well provide an update on our january call associated with our fourth quarter earnings john b owen a director interim chief executive officer president discover financial services let me just add a little bit to johns answer on kind of where we are from a regulatory standpoint the fdic consent order that was made public this month related to really the findings from end of looking back as weve said before weve made significant investments in our risk management and compliance capabilities over the last months from a spending standpoint weve increased our spending from million in to about million in what i would tell you is weve made good progress resolving many of our issues but we still have a significant amount of work to do before were satisfied with where we are on the card misclassification issue its not part of that fdic consent order thats a separate matter and where we are on that as weve mentioned before we did have an outside law firms completed an investigation on the card misclassification issue that work is substantially complete at this point in time weve shared that result of that with our board of directors and also with our regulators and at this point in time were awaiting feedback from our regulators sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from bill carcache with wolfe research your line is open discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning i wanted to followup on the reserve rate comments john greene you referenced several macro variables impacting the reserve and you also cited higher delinquencies which are more idiosyncratic some investors are concerned that rising dqs may be a function of more than just seasoning maybe could you just help us with what your response would be to the concern that some investors have expressed that the outsized reserve build is a sign that discover may have reached for growth too aggressively during the pandemic and is now facing the consequences perhaps what could ultimately end up being greater credit degradation in and possibly beyond particularly since were still in an environment where the unemployment rate is john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah thanks bill so let me go back a little bit and be real clear about what happened at the second half of and in terms of originations so second half of we resumed and we went back to our traditional credit box in the early part of we continued with that traditional discover credit box we did do a test in marginal prime and near prime which we turned on we saw the results and we turned off in the second quarter or early third quarter of so about six months of origination not dramatic volume by any means but certainly a test was good opportunity to learn to see if we could capture some profitable share what we found was those accounts werent meeting our return of volatility thresholds so they were shut down the rest of the vintage was within the traditional credit box that discover had and remains there although were peeling back i will say this the vintage was certainly outsized as a result of demand and great execution from our marketing team the profitability of that still remains very very strong in the short term medium term and long term so if were going to do it all over again at this point wed certainly answer definitively yes we would continue to originate the loans that we put on the books but the vintage is significantly larger than other vintages so the natural loss content of new originations is somewhere between and months and we expect that to play out and as i said the delinquencies and chargeoffs to peak sometime in so i hope that is helpful in terms of giving a little bit of color in terms of the process we went through our risk tolerance and what we expect to see from those vintages bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yes thats helpful thanks john i appreciate that if i could ask a followup of john owen could you speak to the possibility of potentially i guess your overall interest level and potentially pursuing strategic alternatives for any of the other businesses whether thatd be student lending or anything else or is that more likely to wait even more likely to hold off until the new ceo kind of comes on board which you mentioned is probably in the next several months john b owen a director interim chief executive officer president discover financial services yeah happy to talk about that as you know we really cant speculate or talk about rumors or selling parts of the business what i can tell you is part of our strategic planning process that we do every year is to evaluate all of discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 our businesses for returns and fit from a strategic standpoint we do that as an annual process we are going through that process as we speak but again thats something we do as part of our annual planning process bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you for taking my questions appreciate it operator thank you our next question will come from ryan nash with goldman sachs your line is open ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc hey good morning guys john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services good morning ryan ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc so john you reiterated the expense guidance for which is obviously a positive and im sure youre going through the budgeting process right now but i guess based on what you know today regarding the consent order the work that john owen that you referenced that youre doing youve made substantial progress plus overall inflation any sense for what expense growth is going to look like into maybe just talk about some of the moving pieces that you expect to drive the expense base next year john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services sure im not going to be real specific on were still in the process of building out the budget and were yet to share our recommendation with the board but i can give you a general kind of direction of what were seeing so the first point i think is important to put out there is that we continue to target our efficiency ratio to be below now thats over the medium term obviously our execution this year with the revenue growth and even with substantial investments in compliance and other areas of the business shows an efficiency ratio significantly below but over the midterm thats something i think investors can expect the second piece thats important is that despite a significant amount of investment in risk and compliance resources we will continue to be disciplined in our allocation of expense dollars and were focused on making sure that the expense dollars that we do spend either help us with our compliance and risk management programs overall or generate positive earnings potential for the firm so theyre the focal point in terms of some of the things we continue to look at were looking at our facilities footprint we expect to be able to continue to make some progress on that our thirdparty spend were scrutinizing significantly with the help of our procurement and vendor management teams and were going to continue to look at resource levels to make sure theyre appropriate for the environment and what were trying to execute on so i hope that provides some discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 context ryan on how were thinking about the expense base in the aggregate and that will translate into what we hope is a reasonably good set of expense and efficiency numbers into the future ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc got it thanks for the color maybe the followup on some of sanjay and bills question so when i think about the comments that you and john made regarding the trajectory of the vintage likely hasnt begun to season yet inflations weighing on consumers can you maybe just help us understand more broadly just thinking about how we should see the trajectory of delinquencies meaning could we actually see the underperformance that weve experienced get worse as we sort of go through this next period of time given that you do have this really big vintage thats coming through and any commentary on framing how much of this is seasoning and how much of the delinquency performance is seasoning of the book versus actual underlying deterioration that youre seeing in the core customer base john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah a lot of parts there ryan let me start by kind of walk you through what were seeing in the portfolio so we are seeing kind of differences in performance on customers that historically have been transactor versus revolver so our revolver base were seeing a more significant decrease in sales activity which makes sense right as they try to manage their household budget were seeing accounts that transacted in and beginning to revolve more so the revolve rate is back to where we were historically and the vintages early indications are that its performing very very well is performing well but not as well as so my expectation is that delinquencies will slow in the first half of if that doesnt happen thats an indication that the stress that the consumers are seeing is more significant than what were observing today ryan m nash q analyst goldman sachs co llc thanks for all the color john operator thank you our next question will come from john hecht with jefferies your line is open john hecht q analyst jefferies llc hey guys thanks very much actually most of my questions and the fact just even the last question was exactly overlapping so maybe ill just quickly ask number one is maybe quick update on kind of the competitive environment what kind of zero balance kind of transfer activity youre engaging in and other kind of factors that you would tie to competition as kind of the credit environment maybe migrates a little bit and then what are you guys on that front what are you doing with respect to underwriting to account for some of these changes that youre seeing as well john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services great yeah ill take that so the environment continues to be competitive from a card origination standpoint we are seeing less competition in kind of the lower fico band so remember were a prime revolver so were discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 focused on prime customers and the lower tier of origination envelope is frankly less competitive so were careful as were looking at that to make sure that those folks seeking credit are worthy of credit and not going to turn into a subsequent chargeoff the upper prime remains very very competitive the rewards competition you can see it by the television ads has certainly subsided significantly so the markets always competitive the competition varies among various fico bands and were going to continue to compete and generate positive new accounts but were also mindful of the credit situation john hecht q analyst jefferies llc great thank you guys very much operator thank you our next question will come from jeff adelson with morgan stanley your line is open jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc hey good morning thanks for taking my questions john greene just wanted to followup on the commentary of peak losses i think you mentioned sometime in mid to late i think last quarter you talked about maybe this getting pushed into is there a risk that maybe the peak kind of plateaus at or around those higher levels or do you think as your vintage kind of peaks out and starts moderating in size the losses and delinquencies should just naturally drift lower john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah i think it will peak and then upon its peak i think it will stabilize up there for a few quarters maybe two to three quarters and then we expect it to come down thats all subject to kind of the macro environment obviously but in terms of what were seeing today thats the expectation jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc and then just on the sales volumes i know they were pretty flattish this quarter just wondering under the hood whats going on there is this representative of maybe more of a slower growth in new accounts is maybe your samestore customer still growing at a faster pace yearoveryear and then just maybe thinking through the dynamic of faster network volumes faster debit volumes anything going on there thats driving your debit and network volumes to reaccelerate versus your proprietary card volumes as well john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah so let me start with sales so what were seeing is a downward trend in sales so if you go back to the fourth quarter of were at about yearoveryear growth first quarter was in the second quarter and about here in the third quarter and through midoctober about interestingly enough the dynamics are changing in terms of categories so online spend is up at around to every day spend is up about thats largely inflationdriven we believe and discretionary is flat to down with the exception of entertainment expense or entertainmentrelated discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 categories which is up north of which is hard for me to understand at this point but were trying to dig into the details in terms of implications for next year were going to assume a relatively modest sales growth maybe slow in the lower single digits the transactor revolver components of that i mentioned that already so more pullback on the revolver base the other piece of your question is debit transactions weve had great execution from our pulse business so weve expanded a number of contractual arrangements and also debit choice routing has actually made a difference in the volumes so our pulse team is executing well and appears to be capturing some share jeffrey adelson q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay great thanks for taking my questions john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services youre welcome operator thank you our next question will come from rick shane with jpmorgan your line is open richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks guys for taking my questions this morning hey look youve cited a couple of things that are driving the increase in delinquencies youve talked about seasoning of vintage youve talked about some exposure to lower fico scores within the cohorts at the same time you guys are staring to apply a lot more machine learning to your portfolio and your process im curious if youre identifying other factors that are contributing to the increase in delinquencies whether its age demographic geography what might be other factors that are contributing to this in the context of strong labor markets and then the followup to that is with that information can you then apply different servicing strategies to enhance that performance john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah youre into the secret sauce of underwriting rick but ill give you a little bit of overview so we spent a lot of time trying to revive to update our models and we looked at no exaggeration probably different risk identifiers or risk letters and what we did find is savings rate is important household net worth is important the amount of credit on us so on the credit report and discovers balance sheet as well as the amount of credit off are continue to be really really important and then also theres some work being done on cash flow underwriting because of some of the offbureau credit that we experienced or the whole market experienced in and so were going to continue to look to refine our models and see what we can do to identify accounts that are going to be highly profitable and originate those discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 in terms of the second part of your question around servicing strategies theres been a lot of work done on best time to contact and weve got some machine learning models that are focused on that as well as best channel to contact so is it via phone email text or other means all that work is ongoing and frankly itll never stop it will be a continued refinement of the model so that we can collect effectively and originate profitably richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc got it hey john its very interesting and very helpful thank you operator thank you our next question will come from mihir bhatia with bank of america merrill lynch your line is open mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc good morning and thank you for taking my questions to start i wanted to actually ask about personal loans youre continuing to see some very healthy growth there can you talk a little bit more about some of the drivers i think i know you mentioned a little bit of payment rate pullback but what about from a competition standpoint whats driving that and then just related to that to the comments youve been making about on the credit card side wanted to understand if youre seeing any meaningful deterioration in credit there anything on the vintage do the vintage comments apply here anything like we should be thinking about there are you tightening underwriting currently in that personal loan space too yeah thanks john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah thanks mihir so our average ticket on a personal loan is significantly larger than many of our competitors and the predominant share of the volume now is for debt consolidation efforts and important to recognize that as part of our underwriting process when theres a debt consolidation customer somewhere between to of the disbursement goes to the creditors to ensure that the overall cost of debt for that customer is lowered and therefore their ability to pay as high so thats an important distinction in terms of growth what weve seen is high level of demand but also a reduction in the payment rate and that reduction in the payment rate has also been responsible for a very significant chunk of the growth that weve seen in the quarter in terms of kind of the performance there it is what ill say returning to more historical performance metrics but again highly profitable and you can see from the report or from the details in terms of delinquency rates that remain very very low relative to historical standards mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thats helpful thank you maybe if i could just turn back a little for a second to the compliance issue question and the timing et cetera it sounds like from what youre saying related to the merchant mispricing issue the outside law firm has completed the investigation youve discussed results with regulators already so i think what a lot of people are just trying to understand is what needs to happen for the buybacks to resume i understand its difficult to put a specific date out there but is the overall message its going to take several discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 quarters for those to resume maybe just help us understand what needs to happen here for you to get comfortable and again like i understand you dont want to put a specific timeframe but is the right message that its going to be several quarters more thanks john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah so no specific timing on the resumption so what we want to do is have further dialogue with our merchants to ensure were progressing the remediation and negotiations we also continue to have discussions with our regulatory agencies and were looking to progress those and were also reviewing our capital positions right theres a number of pulls on capital this year certainly the phenomenal loan growth that weve seen weve got basel endgame thats on the horizon we have the cecl phasein also impacting capital levels so were going to take a look at the profitability for take a look at the progress were making on the card tiering issue and overall risk in governance items and make a recommendation to the board so ill say my key summary here is that our capital priorities havent changed were focused on generating positive earnings to be able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders our margin rates remain robust our return on equity this quarter and for the year remains really really strong so its a matter of just making sure weve got the right balance between investing and return of capital mihir bhatia q analyst bofa securities inc okay thank you operator thank you our next question will come from bob napoli with william blair your line is open robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you followup on return on equity one of the questions we get i mean obviously discovers reported very strong roe for very long time with the changes in regulations and potential capital changes what are your thoughts on discover being able to generate the types of return on equity that weve seen over the last years or so john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah certainly relative to kind of history and then going forward a couple of important points so we have operated with capital well above our operating target for the better part of i dont know at least as long as ive been here four years now and we are approaching the target i will say that our overall capital position does remain very very strong right so regulatory minimums scb so the required capital and were at here on cet1 for the quarter so my expectation is were going to manage the business to continue to generate high returns and deliver a high level of return on equity overall and being able to invest in the business and return excess capital to shareholders so as we go out three to five years its a bit challenging to predict a regulatory regime and the expectations for institutions such as ours in terms of overall capital levels but were well positioned to generate positive capital and return capital discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you i appreciate that and then just on the overall the longterm growth of your business your core customer the tam of your business and the ability for discover to grow i mean i think historically high single digit kind of loan growth is and spending growth what are your thoughts is the ability to grow those types of rates what we should continue to expect and how does the cash back debit product maybe affect that growth john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah i mean certainly our expectation is to continue to grow at least in line with kind of historical norms the cashback debit product we actually think has a lot of power behind it so the features of the product itself are super right so cash back on debit transactions we have a positive kind of business impact from our ability to capture interchange on those transactions so thats positive and then its a whole new customer outlet for us so executed well it will bring in a new cohort of customers that we can then underwrite and crosssell to further help the customer experience in terms of meeting additional banking needs and turn that checking product into a credit card relationship or perhaps a personal loan down the road so were super excited about it robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you operator thank you our next question will come from kevin barker with piper sandler your line is open kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co i just wanted to follow up on some of the spending on tech in particular in the info processing line could you provide a little more detail on some of the projects that you have in place and whether you expect those to be ongoing or are there additional projects that you anticipate particularly around tech investment and other investments that youre making within the franchise thank you john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah so were a digital institution so the first piece is were going to continue to invest in tech and advanced analytics to kind of help their customer experience and then also help us to generate positive returns some of the specific projects that were working on so weve got a number of advanced analytics programs around collections and around originations in order to be able to service the customer as well and then target the right sort of customers we also did a bunch of work last year and into this year in terms of improving the closure rate of leads from a lead into a funded customer whether it was a savings or credit customer this year were investing heavily in our risk and compliance systems so certainly theres tech spend going on there we also have tech spend related to our onprem servers and moving to a hybrid and cloud environment thats certainly a significant spend and then also given the risk and compliance issues that weve seen historically were spending a lot of time taking a look at how our core systems work the data that goes in and the data that comes out and what we do with the data and looking to kind of reduce the amount of manual touches to that data so all of that is part of the reason or the reasons why were seeing kind of information processing and tech spend overall increase this year discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 john b owen a director interim chief executive officer president discover financial services two other areas i would call out around our fraud detection we continue to invest heavily in our fraud detection thats ongoing battle every quarter but weve made significant investments in fraud and continue to push on that area the second thing around our digital capabilities as a digital bank weve got a very easytouse system easy application process very easy for customers to open up our cash back debit as we spent a lot of time and effort in customer flows and customer engagement and how we onboard customers in a more seamless manner kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you for all that detail and just a followup on your investment on enhancing recovery rates have you seen any particular shift in the recovery rates you have today or where theyre trending relative to past cycles john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services no specific changes to recovery rates we are seeing more customers seek credit assistance and negotiate settlements there seems to be a cottage industry developing around that and thats back in i think it was the month of july we saw a chunk of chargeoffs come through as a result of settlements from these institutions but overall recovery rates remain strong the pool of chargeoffs to be able to capture recoveries from obviously is increasing as the chargeoffs increase so thats actually part of our how we take a look at overall credit and reserving kevin j barker q analyst piper sandler co thank you john john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services youre welcome operator thank you our next question will come from erika najarian with ubs your line is open nicholas holowko q analyst ubs securities llc this is nick holowko on for erika thanks for taking our questions most of them have been answered but just wanted to followup with one question on loan growth so obviously card growth remains really robust and you raised your guidance to midteens for the year and im just wondering given the comments on the stress in the lower and mid fico scores and then the delinquency trends and then your comments that the revolve rate has really normalized im wondering if you can help us with which parts of the fico band in your portfolio are driving the loan growth and whether youre seeing any outsized contribution from those on the lower end john t greene a executive vice president chief financial officer discover financial services yeah so what were seeing is kind of loan build driven by two factors so its somewhere between and of the build is or the loan growth is from new accounts and then the remainder is coming from payment discover financial services dfs corrected transcript q3 earnings call 19oct2023 rate normalization so were seeing kind of portfolio of customers increasing their balances and that normalization of payment rate is pretty consistent on the upper bands call it the midpoint to the top twothirds of the portfolio the
