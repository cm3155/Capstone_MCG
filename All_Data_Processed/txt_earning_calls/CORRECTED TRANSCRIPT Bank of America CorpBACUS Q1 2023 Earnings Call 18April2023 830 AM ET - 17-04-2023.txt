corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 so with that i will turn it over to brian thank you brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp good morning and thanks to all of you for joining us im starting on slide of the materials your company produced one of its highest core eps earnings numbers in a challenged operating environment in the first quarter simply put we navigated that environment well the preparedness and strength of bank of america and the trust of our clients reflects a decadelong responsible growth model and relationship nature of our franchise during quarter one importantly our organic growth engine continued to perform let me first summarize some points and then ill turn it over to alastair to take you through the details of the quarter if you go to slide of the materials bank of america delivered strong earnings growing eps over first quarter every business segment performed well we grew clients and accounts organically and at a strong pace we delivered our seventh straight quarter of operating leverage led by a yearoveryear of revenue growth we further strengthened our balance sheet with our cet1 ratio increasing to regulatory capital ended the highest nominal level in our history to billion we maintained strong liquidity we ended the quarter with more than billion in global liquidity sources we earned good returns for you as our shareholders with a return on tangible common equity of a basis points return on average assets tangible book value per share grew yearoveryear we did this as the economy slowed and remember our research team continues to predict a shallow recession that will occur beginning in the quarter three of it would be interesting to look at our consumer behavior payments by consumer continues to drive the us economy weve seen debit and credit card spending at about yearoveryear growth pace a little slower but still healthy but remember card spending represents less than a quarter of how consumers pay for things out of their accounts of bank of america overall payments from our customers accounts across all sources were up yearoveryear for march as a month yeartodate theyre up about for the quarter after slowing in the back half of a bit we saw the pace of payments pick back up in quarter one especially in the latter parts of the quarter consumers financial positions remains generally healthy they are employed with generally higher wages continue to have strong account balances and have good access to credit as you think through all the tightening actions of the fed the flows to alternative yielding assets investments and the disruptions of the past quarter our deposits continued to perform well ending the quarter at trillion if you think about it thats about the same balance that we had in midoctober of so weve seen these balances stabilize and remain above they were and prior to the pandemic the team has managed well during these periods while remaining focused on the things we can control to drive value through our franchise i thank them for a very strong quarter near record earnings with strong returns let me turn the call over to alastair to walk through the details of the quarter alastair borthwick chief financial officer bank of america corp thank you brian and ill pick up on slide where we list some of the more detailed highlights of the quarter and then on slide we present the summary income statement so im going to refer to both of these together bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 as brian mentioned for the quarter we generated billion of net income and that resulted in per diluted share our revenue grew and that was led by a improvement in net interest income coupled with strong growth in sales and trading results excluding dva our noninterest revenue was strong despite three headwinds first we had lower service charges as commercial clients paid lower fees for treasury services since they now receive higher earned rates on balances and obviously that allows us to invest those funds to earn nii on consumer we had lower nsf insufficient funds in overdraft fees as a result of our policy changes announced in late second we had lower asset management fees and that just reflects the lower equity market levels and fixed income market levels and third investment banking fees were lower just reflecting the continuation of sluggish industry activity and reduced fee pools now all that said despite these headwinds each of the fee categories saw modest improvement from the fourth quarter levels asset quality remained strong and provision expense for the quarter was million that consisted of million of net chargeoffs and million of reserve build and that reserve build compares to reserve release in the first quarter of million our chargeoff rate was basis points and still well below the fourth quarter of when our prepandemic rate was basis points and remember was a multidecade low so credit obviously remains quite strong i want to make one other point on slide and that is simply to note that pretax preprovision income grew yearoveryear compared to reported net income growth of so lets turn to the balance sheet that starts on slide and you can see during the quarter our balance sheet increased billion to trillion brian noted our liquidity levels at the end of the period those rose to more than billion from december 31st thats billion higher and it remains billion above our pre pandemic level in the fourth quarter of shareholders equity increased billion from the fourth quarter as earnings were only partially offset by capital distributed to shareholders and we saw an improvement in aoci of billion due to lower longterm interest rates the aoci included more than half a billion increase from improved valuations of afs debt securities and that flows through cet1 and the remaining billion due to changes in cash flow hedges doesnt impact regulatory capital during the quarter we paid billion in common dividends and we bought back billion in shares turning to regulatory capital our cet1 level improved to billion since december and our cet1 ratio improved basis points to once again adding to our buffer over our current minimum requirement as well as the minimum requirement that well see on january 1st of that means in the past months weve improved our cet1 ratio by basis points and weve supported our clients and weve returned billion in capital to shareholders cet1 capital improved billion and that reflects the benefit of earnings and the aoci improvement partially offset by the capital we returned to shareholders our riskweighted assets increased modestly and that partially offset the benefit to the cet1 ratio of the higher capital we generated and then our supplemental leverage ratio increased to that compares to a minimum requirement of and leaves plenty of capacity for balance sheet growth and our tlac ratio remains comfortably above our requirements but lets spend a minute on loan growth and well do that by turning to slide where you can see that average loans grew yearoveryear driven by commercial loans and credit card growth the credit card growth bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 reflects increased marketing it reflects enhanced offers and higher levels of card account openings the commercial growth across the past year reflects the diversity of commercial activity across global banking and global markets and to some degree global wealth and on a more nearterm linked quarter basis loans grew at a much slower pace partly driven by seasonal credit card paydowns after the fourth quarter holiday spending and then commercial demand slowed in q1 and we saw some paydowns by our wealth management clients as they lowered leverage as rates rose so lets turn to deposits and theres obviously been a lot of additional focus this quarter so i want to spend extra time here and im going to start with slide and talk about average deposits just a few points we need to make before focusing on a more detailed discussion of the recent trends average total deposits for the first quarter were trillion that is down linked quarter and down yearoveryear our deposits peaked in the fourth quarter of and even as the fed has continued to withdraw money supply our deposits have held around trillion because theres a lot more industry deposits today in a much fig bigger economy today compared to prepandemic our average deposits were up compared to our prepandemic q4 balance and the industrys deposits were up to trillion so weve obviously fared a little bit better than the industry we put our prepandemic deposits for each line of business on the slide so you can compare our balances then and now i want to highlight consumer checking balances which remained higher than prepandemic and as i think all of us would expect gwim combined client deposits are up a lesser as those are the clients that generally move their excess cash into other offbalance sheet products and in global banking you can see the rotation to interest bearing across time as rates rose but lets get a little more granular and a little more near term and well use slide for that where you can see the breakout of deposit trends on a weekly ending basis across the last two quarters you can also see that we plotted the timeline of fed target and rate hikes on the top left chart just for comparison through time in the upper left you can see the trend of our total deposits we ended q1 at trillion thats down and as brian mentioned over the course of the past months those balances have been relatively stable in consumer looking at the top right chart we show the difference here in the movement through the quarter between the balances of low to no interest checking accounts and the higher yielding nonchecking accounts and across the entire quarter we saw modest billion decline in total checking balances obviously had some variability around paydays in particular but note the relative stability of checking deposits because these are the operational accounts with money in motion to pay the bills and everyday living costs for families id also point out that our checking balances were modestly growing even ahead of march 9th upheaval and continued to move higher through the quarter on the back of disruption lower nonchecking balances mostly reflect money moved out of deposits and into brokerage accounts where we earn a small fee rate paid increased basis points from the fourth quarter to basis points on this trillion dollars of total consumer deposits and remains low because of the mix that is checking lastly id just note that the rate movements in this business are concentrated in the small cds and consumer investment deposits which together represent about of the deposits in wealth management as you would expect it shows the most relative decline and you can see the continued trend of clients moving money from lower yielding sweep accounts into higher yielding preferred deposits and off balance sheet to other investment alternatives now if we went back further youd see that roughly billion has moved out of sweeps in the past year which leaves billion in these accounts so you can see how with the pace and size and rate hikes slowing we expect the declines in balances to lessen from here bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 at the bottom right note the global banking deposit movement where we hold about billion in customer deposits these are generally operational deposits of our commercial customers and they use that to manage their cash flows through the course of the year those are down billion from the fourth quarter and whats interesting to note is that our total deposits in this segment have been stable at around billion for the past six months and this business just continues to see rotation into interest bearing the mix of interest bearing deposits on an ending basis moved from last quarter to in q1 and obviously we paid increased rates on those interestbearing deposits and its this rotation in global banking thats driving the rotational shift of the total company and its pretty typical and to be expected in this environment so in summary deposits continue to behave as we would expect the cash transactional balances have shown some recent stabilization and for investment cash weve seen deposits move to brokerage and other platforms for direct holdings of money market mutual funds treasuries and were capturing many of those flows as you see in our numbers its just we expect that to slow going forward so now that weve examined trends for the different lines of business i want to make some important points about the characteristics of our deposit franchise using slide and this will just help reinforce for shareholders who own bank of america that theyre investing in one of the worlds great deposit franchises all of it based off of relationships we have with our customers and the value they place on the awardwinning capabilities and convenience they have access to starting from the top focus first on consumer you can see that more than of deposits have been with us for more than years and more than twothirds of our consumer deposits are balances with customers who have had relationships with the bank for more than ten years also more than threequarters of those customers are very highly engaged in their activities with us theyre also geographically disbursed across the united states given our presence in of the top markets lastly whether you look at consumers or small business the value proposition is what is driving the same result weve got longtenured customers with deep relationships that are highly engaged turning to wealth management you can see a similar story around long tenure and quite active relationships the average relationship of our gwim clients is around years and again these clients are very geographically diverse theyre also very digitally engaged and we continue to see deepening around banking solutions and products of all types there is lots of options for these clients that extend from their operational checking accounts all the way up through preferred deposit options and then we also benefit from having great alternatives from them within our investment platform on global banking note that of our us deposit balances are held by clients whos have had an account with us for at least years furthermore as we measure the number of solutions that clients have with us we know that of balances are held by clients that have at least five products on us and just like the other businesses theyre highly diversified by industry and geography so those are some of the things that make our quality deposit base stable so now that weve walked through both loans and deposits i want to transition a bit to make some points on balance sheet management and to focus on the liquidity we enjoy by having a surplus of customer deposits that far exceeds the loan demand of our clients today and far exceeded the loan demand of our clients prepandemic having the deposits alone doesnt pay the expenses to support these great customer bases and it doesnt mean much to our shareholders unless we put them to work to extract the value of those deposits so thats what were trying to illustrate and we want to show you how we do that bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 you can see that on slide where you note we had significant excess deposits over loans prepandemic and during the pandemic that amount increased significantly before the pandemic we had half a trillion more in deposits than loans and that peaked in late at more than trillion and it remains high at roughly billion still today thats the context as we talk about how we manage excess cash so lets turn to slide and here were going to focus on the banking book because our global markets balance sheet has remained largely market funded and just follow the graph from left to right at the top of the slide you note trend of cash and cash equivalents and the two components of the debt securities balances available for sale and held to maturity and you can see the trend of the overall combined cash and securities balance movement and it closely mirrors the previous slides excess deposit trend as you would expect in deposits grew while loans declined and that was pandemic borrowing from our commercial clients stopping and then quickly paying it off throughout as we put deposits to work we took a number of actions to protect our capital and that included a buildup in holdtomaturity better aligning our capital treatment with our intent to hold those securities to maturity we also hedged rate risk in the availableforsale book using pay fixed received variable swaps so these securities acted like cash and they earned higher yields and guarded against capital volatility as we entered the middle of it became more clear that the stimulus payment would likely be the last one and therefore we believed deposits would be peaking as a result we stopped adding to our holdtomaturity securities book that book peaked in the third quarter of at billion million were mortgage backed and the rest were treasuries and all thats happened is that notional balances have declined in each of the past six quarters ending the quarter at billion and within that the mortgagebacked portfolio is down billion to billion as rates began to rise quickly throughout the value of our deposits rose and at the same time the disclosed market value of the holdtomaturity has declined resulting in a negative market valuation on those bonds that negative market valuation peaked in the third quarter came down in the fourth quarter and its come down another billion in the first quarter in our 10k disclosure we include a chart which shows the maturity distribution of our securities portfolio and id remind you this is based on the maturity dates of those originations ie the date of the last contractual payment when we look at the actual cash flows of those bonds over time it results in an average weighted life of the hold tomaturity securities book of a little more than eight years and as you can see since the third quarter of weve continued to see increases in the overall yield on the balances due to both the maturity and reinvestment of lower yielding securities as well as remix into higher yielding cash and as you can see with deposits paying basis points that compares to our blend of cash and government guaranteed securities which pays basis points so we continued to benefit nii and yield and finally one very important last point i want to make which is on the improved nii of our banking book because remember we manage the entirety of our balance sheet that includes our deposits and thats where you see the net interest income has improved significantly nii excluding global markets which we disclose each quarter troughed in the third quarter of at billion and its now billion higher on a quarterly basis at billion in the first quarter of and thats the acid test of managing the entire balance sheet so lets turn now to slide and focus on net interest income on a gaap nonfte basis nii in the first quarter was billion and the fte nii number was billion focusing on fte net interest income increased bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 billion from the first quarter of or while our net interest yield improved basis points to the improvement was driven by rates and that includes reductions in securities premium amortization average fed fund rates are up basis points yearoveryear relative to that increase in fed funds which has benefited all of our variable rate assets the rate paid on our total deposits rose basis points and the rate paid today on interest bearing deposits is up basis points average loan growth of billion also aided the yearoveryear nii improvement turning to a linked quarter discussion nii of billion is down million from q4 and thats primarily driven by the continued impact of lower deposit balances and the mix shift into interest bearing its also influenced by lower global markets nii which remember still gets passed through to clients via higher noninterest income as part of the trading revenue excluding the million decline in global markets nii the banking book nii of billion that was modestly higher as the benefit of increased short interest rates some modest loan growth and some deposit favorability was offset by two less days of interest in the quarter turning to asset sensitivity on a forward basis the plus basis point parallel shift on march 31st stands at billion of expected nii over the next months from our banking book of that sensitivity is driven by short rates in summary the first quarter nii was billion in this quarter on an fte basis and that was a little better than our billion expectation as we began the quarter since deposits and rate passthroughs were both modestly better looking forward based on everything we know about interest rates and customer behavior we expect second quarter nii on an fte basis to be around lower compared to q1 so think about that nii as about billion fte plus or minus driven by expected deposit movements as well as lower global markets nii which again is offset in trading revenue so let me remind you of some of the caveats when it comes do that nii guidance first importantly it assumes that interest rates in the forward curve materialize and that includes one more hike and then a couple of cuts in we also expect funding costs for global markets client activity to continue to increase based on those high rates and as noted the impact of that is still offset in noninterest income and that obviously assumes our current client positioning and the forward rate expectations we continue to expect modest loan growth so thats in our nii expectation as well and its driven by credit card and to a lesser degree commercial and then finally we just expect lower deposits and rotational shifts towards interest bearing really for three reasons first we expect further fed balance sheet reductions to continue to reduce deposits for the industry second we anticipate lower wealth management deposits in the second quarter thats pretty typical due to the seasonal impact of clients paying income taxes and to a lesser degree now a continuation of balance movement seeking better yields offbalance sheet and third we just continue to expect some of the rotation of commercial deposits towards interest bearing okay lets go to slide well talk about expense and here what you can see is in the first quarter our expenses were billion thats up million from the fourth quarter and its driven by seasonal elevation from payroll taxes mostly of million a little bit from higher fdic insurance expense that was another million in this quarter and the cost of adding people call that another million we ended the first quarter with a little more than people with the company that was people more than yearend during the quarter we welcomed additional people into the company in january thats due to outstanding offers that we extended in the fourth quarter that meant that our head count peaked in january at a little more than and at the end of last week we were down to we continue to expect that to bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 move lower over time and we expect by the end of the second quarter our fulltime equivalent head count will be roughly excluding our summer interns as we look forward to the next quarter then we would expect q2 expense to benefit from the reduction of the seasonal elevation of payroll tax in q1 and we would also expect to see expense reductions coming from head count reductions through attrition over time and our operational excellence work so we expect expense in q2 to be around million or million lower than q1 so think of that as around billion plus or minus in q2 and then further we just expect continued sequential expense declines in the third quarter and then again in the fourth quarter as we benefit from continued head count discipline and attrition through time well turn to asset quality on slide and i want to start the credit discussion by saying once again asset quality of our customers remains healthy and net chargeoffs continue to rise from their near historic lows net charge offs of million increased million from the fourth quarter that increase was driven by credit card losses as higher latestage delinquencies flowed through to chargeoffs for context the credit card net chargeoff rate was in this first quarter and that compares to in the fourth quarter of prepandemic provision expense was million in q1 and that included million reserve build thats obviously less than the million build we took in the fourth quarter and it reflects modest loan growth and an ever so slightly improved macroeconomic outlook that on a weighted basis continues to include an unemployment rate still north of as we end we included a slide in the appendix this quarter that highlights the mix and credit metrics of our commercial real estate exposure and i just wanted to remind everyone here weve been very intentional around our client selection very intentional around portfolio concentration and deal structure over many years and as a result weve seen npls and realized losses that remain quite low for this portfolio we had a total of million of commercial real estate losses in of that was in office loans and that resulted in an annualized loss rate of basis points in the first quarter to give some perspective our office loan losses were million we have roughly billion in commercial real estate loans outstanding thats less than of our loan book its highly diversified by geography and no part of the country represents more than of the book its also very diversified across property type within property type our office portfolio is billion its about of our total loans the portfolio is roughly class a properties and when we originate theyre typically around loan to value even though weve seen some property value declines these exposures still remain well secured billion is classified as reservable criticized and even on the most recent refreshes on our toughest loans we still have ltvs in our office book billion is scheduled to mature this year another billion in with the remainder spread over the following years so we continue to feel that the portfolio is wellpositioned and adequately reserved given the current conditions on slide for completeness we highlight the credit quality metrics for both our consumer and commercial portfolios and with that im going to turn it back to brian to talk about the lines of business brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you alastair and were going to begin on slide so i want to bring us back to the things that drive the longterm value of this franchise and the value for you our shareholders every business segment grew bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 customers and accounts organically in the quarter and used digital tools and capabilities to drive engagement even deeper and also to drive customer satisfaction to industryleading levels on slide weve highlighted some of the important elements of organic growth i wont go through all the line items here but in consumer we opened net new checking accounts million credit card accounts and more investment accounts that aided to record quarter one consumer investment flows consumer also has had quarters of positive net new checking accounts in global wealth we had a record quarter adding net new wealth relationships in global banking we added clients increased the number of products per relationship in global markets as we said earlier jimmy demare and team had one of the highest quarters of sales and trading the other elements of earnings the management team remains focused on throughout this inflationary environment is our expense management efforts but even given those we continue to make investments in the future we continued the streak of operating leverage in our company and you can see that in slide we now have had seven quarters of operating leverage the efficiency ratio went to and the nominal dollars of expenses we have today are similar to what we had years ago as we go to slide lets talk about individual businesses and consumer banking first for the quarter consumer banking earned billion on good organic revenue growth and delivered its eighth consecutive quarter of strong operating leverage while we continue to invest in the future top line revenue grew expenses rose these results demonstrate the true value of the trillion deposit franchise and the deep relationship we have with the clients in that business the business continues to have billion in excess deposits over its loan balances and as we said earlier grew checking accounts million new checking accounts since the pandemic started solid earnings growth of understates the success of this business as prior year included reserve releases while we built reserves this quarter on a pretax preprovision basis ppnr grew yearoveryear i will also note that the revenue growth overcame a decline in service charges as a result of us lowering our nsfod charges for customers several quarters ago the expenses in the consumers reflect the continued business investments through growth including adding relationship associates for the increases in the cost to technology and implementation of new tools as you think about this business remember much of the companys minimum wage hikes during the ones we made midyear in addition to our margin an hour impact this business more than any other business however this helped drive the attrition in this business in half compared to last year this quarter on slide you can see some of the digital statistics around consumer we believe that those digital tools our customers have access to are the key to growing and retaining customer relationships these tools also help us deliver more efficiently we now have million users active engaged on our digital properties they log in one billion times a month erica our artificial intelligence driven personal assistant saw usage rise just in the past year and the number of customers using zelle grew in the past year remember these arent new functionalities just being put in place these are growing off a high scale and show the bank of america impact on these products on zelle remember back in mid2021 zelle transactions crossed the number of checks written for our clients now its higher less than two years later and you can see the growth in digital sales that continues the main focus on growing the customer base and delivering the bestinclass tools and service that make us more efficient and more important to our clients in the consumer business and dean athanasia and the team continue to do a good job with respect to those goals bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 on slide we move to wealth management they had results earning about a little over million aftertax in the quarter these results were down from last year as alastair said as asset management fees fell with a negative market levels in equity and fixed income those fees were mitigated by the beneficial impact of revenue from the sizable banking business within this line of business for us as i noted a moment ago both merrill and the private bank saw organic revenue growth and provided solid client flows of billion in the quarter our assets under management flows billion reflect some of the movement in deposits noted earlier but we also saw billion of brokerage flows expenses reflect lower revenuerelated incentives but also reflect continued investments in the business as we continue to add financial advisors weve added more than wealth advisors in the past year alone as we move forward were excited to have eric schimpf and lindsay hans lead this business theyll work closely with katy knox to drive our global wealth and investment management business across the company as we go to global wealth investment management digital on slide you can see the statistics here just as with the consumer business these clients become more and more digitally engaged across time our advisors have led the way in driving a personaldriven advice model supplemented by our digital tools on slide you can see the client digital adoption rate of with merrill and the private bank is over more than embraced digital delivery of their statements which as a key tool or service providing more convenience for them and our advisor erica and zelle interactions continue to grow here also even among these wealthy clients on slide you see the global banking results this business produced very strong results growing revenue yeartoyear to billion the business earned billion aftertax while investment banking remained sluggish our global treasury services business has been robust leading to strong revenue performance loan activity has been good across this business also as noted earlier the deposit flows appear to have stabilized in march and we benefited from some customer flows during the flight to safety during the quarter the companys overall investment banking fees were billion in quarter one and while down from quarter one we saw modest improvement from quarter four provision expense declined yearoveryear as prior years reserve builds compared to release in the current period the credit quality of this business again remains very strong expense increased yearoveryear driven by strategic investments in the business including relationship management hiring and technology costs digital engagement is shown on slide with our global banking customers these commercial customers continue to grow in importance as treasuries and others appreciate ease of doing business with us with through these tools while the volume of transactions the sheer number isnt the same as consumer the volume of money moved is tremendous next business well go to is our global markets business on slide jimmy demare and the team had another strong quarter of results growing yearoveryear earnings to nearly billion aftertax the continued themes of inflation due to political tensions and central banks changing monetary policies around the globe drove volatility in the bond and equity markets which this team did a good job of managing as a result it was a quarter we saw a strong performance in our credit trading business particularly in mortgages and muni trading and macro trading again fared well buoyed by strong client activity and secured financing investments made in this business over the last few years continued to produce favorable results this focus on net sales and trading numbers alone ex dva revenue improved yearoveryear to billion ficc improved while equities were down compared to quarter one of yearoveryear expense increased primarily driven by continued investments as stated in this business finally on slide you can see the all other shows a modest loss which included the million of losses in securities sold as alastair mentioned earlier and last i would note our effective tax rate this quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 continues to benefit us from a strong business with clients supporting environmental investments and housing investments to produce tax benefits excluding those and the other discrete tax benefits our tax rate would have been so in summary a strong quarter by our team delivering for you our shareholders operating leverage organic growth strong credit capital return and strong rotce with that lets jump to qa question and answer section operator operator instruction well take our first question from jim mitchell with seaport global your line is open jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning guys maybe just one question on the niis trajectory you guys remain asset sensitive in the banking book but the forward curve is i think you pointed out that currently expects three rate cuts by the end of the year if that plays out how do you think about that impact on nii in the back half of the year what are the puts and takes as we think about nii beyond alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so jim i think right now the expectations for the market in terms of whether or not there will be another hike in may thats bouncing around pretty good similarly youve got a question of whether or not theres two cuts at the back half or three so were operating with the same information you are were looking at the forward curve day to day thinking that through at the same time were looking at our deposit balances theyre performing kind of the way we would think and were competing for rate paid so and id say generally speaking at this point we feel pretty good about nii its obviously going to be up this year up pretty significantly and we dont provide guidance for a full year for a very simple reason it just comes down to its very difficult to predict what the fed is going to do six months and nine months out but look at this way we can see where consensus is consensus is right around billion plus or minus thats the sort of number that would imply us up for the year to i mean i think were pretty comfortable there but its just so many moving parts thats why we dont provide the guidance jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc no thats all fair and maybe just pivoting to the trading business you had another strong quarter and outperformed peers in the fixed income business is there anything unusually strong there or do you believe you guys have made some sustainable market share gains in that business given your recent investments alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think the team is doing a really good job brian talked about that a couple years ago we made a decision as a team that it was important for us to invest more in that business and we did that and weve made pretty bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 significant investments in equities and in fixed income and we felt like in particular we could continue to grow our macro businesses which weve done and thats what has done a really good job until this quarter this quarter we just happened to fire on more cylinders particularly in ficc because this quarter we had a great quarter for our micro products and you kind of expect that because it was a better quarter for them we had positive returns there so mortgages credit munis financing futures fx all of them had a pretty good quarter and i think jim and the team are just executing at a really high level so they just got to keep at it jim mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc fair enough thanks for taking my questions operator well take our next question from erika najarian with ubs your line is open erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc hi good morning alastair just a clarification you gave us the quarterly expected trajectory for expenses do you still expect to hit billion or so of fullyear expenses in alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp right now thats our expectation were days into the quarter into the year rather obviously as were looking forward we see we know the head count is coming down so thats going to be a tailwind all the way through the course of the year so we dont have any change in our expectations right now were going to see how the year develops weve still got a little bit of a headwind in terms of something like our sales and trading business having a very good revenue year and were still investing in the business so it will be a dog fight particularly as we get into the back half of the year but we still feel good about where we are with respect to expense erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it and my second question is for brian now brian you produced a significant amount of revenue this quarter and grew your cet1 at the same time i think that a lot of investors are looking down the path of significant macro uncertainty as we take that into account how should we think about the buyback activity going forward especially ahead of the stress test result in june brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think you saw this quarter we continue to adopt our basic apply our basic principles which is we support the growth in our customer base we pay the dividends that we think is a rational rate and then we use the rest to basically return to you through share buybacks were in the middle of a stress test as you just mentioned well have to see the results of that we also but the good news is we crossed this quarter which basically is an excess it has a cushion on top of what we need for the first quarter of next year and so well continue to follow our basic principles so we feel very good about our capital and you should expect us to continue to follow the idea to pay the dividend or grow organic support the organic growth pay the dividend and buy back shares but weve got to get through the nearterm sort of what goes on in our business every year at this time bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 erika najarian q analyst ubs securities llc got it thank you operator well go next to ken usdin with jefferies your line is open ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc good morning hey im just wondering on the deposit side can you help us understand theres obviously the ongoing mix shift which you referred to and gave us a lot of great detail on im just wondering as you think forward how much more mix shift are you expecting in terms of dvas as a percentage of total deposits and how do you expect that to also look as you think across the businesses with regards to just where customers are moving funds incrementally thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i think ken we think this everybody thinks this is a big bulk thing bank of america but its really and then looks at broad categories interest bearing and noninterestbearing accounts and indiscernible you have to really think about customer bases and what they do with their money and so theres transactional cash whether thats for consumer running their household daytoday a wealthy consumer running their household daytoday which may have different level of expenses and then the commercial customers who run their business daytoday and then have excess cash from that if theyre successful and then how they all play that through so we think transactional cash as investment cash youve seen a lot of the investment cash just so to speak as alastair mentioned earlier we price competitively for that moves around but the good news is we have a massive investment platform where we put that money to work for our customers if they dont need it to manage their daytoday household so our nii estimates our view of what happens in the future i think the key for the consumer business is to remember that its got billion of excess deposits over its loans its generating a lot of excess deposits that grew billionodd from prepandemic it has been stable the checking balances if you look at those charts we gave you they show you the nearterm movement are stable that generates at a total allin cost of to basis points a lot of the value in a franchise and meaning including the interest bearing part of that franchise that when you think about deposits across time and then like businesses so youd expect some of those trends to continue in terms of customers have excess cash putting it to work differently we expect the deposit rates to move to continue to match the market but the broad value of this deposit franchise is driven by the money people leave us because its transactional cash which is a motion and we dont pay interest on and that is both the consumers and wealthy customers of businesses so its hard its a very detailed question of which we spend a lot of time looking at or the team does as you might imagine ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay and the other question is just then alastair you walked through how youve been changing the composition of the securities portfolio and still benefiting from those variable rate swaps im just wondering if you can help us understand what happens from here in terms of or should you continue to get benefits from those variable rate swaps and then also just have you done any positioning repositioning underneath the surface it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 looks like there were just some securities losses so how much room do you have to continue to to kind of rework the portfolio and grind more income out of the book even as you shrink it alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so ken think about i mean the easiest way to think about those treasuries theyre swapped to floating so theyre essentially cash and actually this quarter we ended up converting some of them into cash just because its simpler its simpler for everyone to understand and theres obviously a pretty good bid for treasuries this quarter so we just converted them into cash thats what accounted for some of the securities loss there it was a couple of hundred million but i think the way to think about it is as the overall securities portfolio remember weve got cash weve got available for sale and you can always think about that as enhanced cash and then weve got holdtomaturity as that continues to pay down were just sweeping it right now into cash thats something ive talked about in the last couple quarters and were putting in cash because number one its a really highyielding asset number two it gives us a lot of options during a period of volatility so pretty straight forward at this point ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it thank you operator our next question comes from mike mayo with wells fargo your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi well i guess the topic of the day week and the month is to what degree are your assets matched with your liabilities and im staring at slide and youve seen the front page of many papers highlighting your unrealized securities losses you highlight the yield on your securities at you highlighted your heldtomaturity portfolio at eight years that would all suggest to some that youre not so wellmatched on the other hand what you dont provide or at least i didnt see it the change in the value of your deposits or even the duration of your deposits so the basic question is can you describe to what degree your assets are matched with your liabilities and where you think you may have been off or on the mark alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah so mike ill start brian can add anything he chooses to but one of the reasons we that we spent as much time laying out the deposit franchise is because in a rising rate environment youd expect obviously that bond markets are going to turn negative and at the same time you and we have been expecting as rates go up the nii would rise because the deposits are so much more valuable in that environment what we laid out for you and for everyone to see is just how broad and stable and diversified is this deposit base we think its very long tenured thats why were laying out some of these things around just around how long the relationships are in consumer and in wealth and in global banking and its one of the reasons mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey alastair if i can just interrupt when you say long tenured can you put any numbers around that a range is i think thats the one biggest most important number if you could just some kind of frame that a little bit bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah if you took a look at slide number weve tried to lay that out for you so you take a look at and consumer for example youre talking about of the clients have been with us for more than ten years thats pretty long tenured i know from my time in the commercial bank our clients on average were years with us you have long operational deposits in all of these businesses so thats what were trying to lay out in front of everyone so you can see that mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay im sorry i interrupted but go ahead alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp now i cant remember where i was mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc you were talking about the unrealized securities loss that the nii went higher as part of the benefits of having multiple speakers alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp no i think what im trying to convey to you too mike and you know how this works weve got to balance all of this because we have to think about the entire balance sheet and theres a lot going on with the entire balance sheet and so what were trying to do is invest that excess which has existed now in hundreds of billions for many many years weve got to invest it the best way we can and the way we do that we talk about balancing it is number one trying to make sure grow capital weve done that were up basis points there in the last year number two were trying to grow liquidity we added billion in this past quarter number three were trying to grow earnings were at billion its one of our best quarters ever so look we can always be better you know that were taking the portfolio and just making it smaller its run off now six quarters in a row were taking all of that and plowing it into cash and loans thats what weve been doing well just continue doing that and the portfolio is going to get smaller and shorter over time and when you look at the asset sensitivity now relative to rates going up a or rates going down a were pretty balanced there too were sort of up billion if rates go up a were down billion if rates go down a so we feel like were in a pretty balanced place and a lot of flexibility at this point mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and then just a followup i guess some will take your greatest strength as a weakness that is you dont pay as much on deposits as others i estimate that you have the lowest cycletodate deposit beta and so what is it that keeps your customers around if youre not going to pay them as much bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think if you look at the value proposition that were talking about if you go to the consumer business for example theyve invested so much in client experience whether its the financial centers renovation whether its the people that weve added in that business over a long period of time whether its the digital the mobile preferred rewards ours is a relationship model and it has been and if you look then like just think about this quarter look at the organic growth in consumer again thats net new checking quarters in a row based on that relationship value proposition thats what were attracting if you go to the wealth management business this was a record quarter for net new households for merrill lynch and a record for the private bank this quarter that tells you were offering people something thats valuable and then we added new bank accounts for people in our wealth management franchise so that again is a significant indicator that what were offering has value to people and if i were to go back to my old business in business banking and commercial banking theyre adding new logos and new clients over time in a way that were really happy with right now so i think the ultimate answer is we are a purposedriven company who put our clients interest first that is helping make their financial lives better and in this period of time people want stability and thats what we offer mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator well go next to glenn schorr with evercore your line is open glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc hi thanks maybe an easy one up first it wasnt noticeable but do you feel like there was a flight to quality benefit during the march madness i would have thought that people would have flocked to the safety of bofa during times like that but you didnt comment specifically on that so thanks alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp so were going to decline glenn to give a specific number were pretty confident we saw noticeable flight to safety and it comes in two parts part is during a period like march and around that week or two and then theres a second part that comes with onboarding clients over a period of time who are trying to move operational accounts here and that takes a while that has a lag so you can think about we get some of the deposits quite quickly but relationships take a longer time to build and onboard so you can see from our numbers it was improving before the disruption weve chosen not to put an exact number on it because there are typical ebbs and flows in any given quarter leading up especially to a payroll end of quarter but generally speaking id say we were improving anyway a lot of that is just organic growth but we obviously benefited glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc okay and you noted though one more hike and then cuts to the back half of the year thats the forward curve whats interesting is the fed doesnt have the same forward curve as the market has so im curious if you could talk to the sensitivity of what if there are no cuts how much of that helps your forward nii thought process bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well we do use the forward curve because we feel like its the most kind of dispassionate assessment with the most information out there in the market from the broader set of people and importantly its not just us making it up so we use the forward curve and i even mentioned during my remarks things are bouncing around around is it one hike is it zero is it two cuts but the sensitivity that we provide around up a or down a is probably the best we can offer at this stage and then depending on how things develop and theyre developing quickly it will allow you to adjust the model accordingly glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc the last simple one is heldtomaturity you talked a lot about it i think the answer is i know it but ill ask it bluntly anyway so you dont feel like you have to do anything material with your unrealized loss which is i get it its in treasuries its swap its agency mortgages but not a credit issue but at this point given the stability of your deposit base loan growth capital growth do you feel like you can just kind of ride it out and grind it down alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp correct right now thats exactly what weve been doing weve communicated that pretty clearly and thats what were continuing to do it just keeps getting smaller and shorter glenn schorr q analyst evercore group llc thank you appreciate it operator well go next to steven chubak with wolfe research your line is open steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hey good morning alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning steven steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so alastair you had mentioned some of the strong kpis that youre seeing within gwim at the same time the business did see a pretty material decline in pretax margins both sequentially and yearonyear i wanted to better understand how the business might evolve under some of the new leadership and how we should just be thinking about the margin trajectory wanted to better understand how youre balancing investment needs with the goal of delivering continued profitability brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 the margin came down largely because you had the sort of incremental hit to the investment side revenue as the markets fell yearoveryear but wed expect that margin to move back up to its more traditional to but you also have to remember they are a big beneficiary or hit of the elevated payroll taxes and other things in the first quarter because as a percentage of our compensation in the company theyre not a small amount but we expect that to move back in the high but we have been working on this business to continue to improve the digitization of the services side of it so basically if you think about it you get worth of revenue and you take about half past the compensation and in the financial advisory grids and the other payouts and then we take the rest of it and convert it to about a deposit the other half and convert about percentage points or of that to profit pretax this quarter down a little bit because of payroll so we feel very good about where we stand on a relative basis but one of the things the team continues to work on across eric and lindsay and katy is to drive operational excellence to a new level in that business because we believe that theres still a lot of cost that can come out around the more simple straightforward products the delivery of those products the paperbased usage and things like that and then also remember we are making investments in advisors we have plus trainees in the businesses across the company and we believe that the best advisor is one thats grown with our own company and we continue to do that and thats a drag on the pl that were willing to take to make sure we have an advisor growth in the future steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc yeah helpful color brian and just for my followup i was hoping either you or alastair could provide just an update on expectations around upcoming regulatory development specifically how your scenario planning for basel any expectations around the fdic special assessment there were a lot of items that had been floated just given recent events in the svb fallout i was hoping to get some perspective just in terms of regulatory mark tomarket brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah i mean i think we dont have anything more than you do in a broad sense but i think at the end of day i think this industry has extremely strong capital liquidity and capabilities that we just demonstrated through the pandemic and then through the aftermath of the pandemic and then through inflation and then through a tightening cycle that hasnt happened before so i feel good about where the industry stands and i think people have to step back and think about it overall and then frankly this industry in the united states is so much stronger than europe it has so much capital per square inch so to speak than europe does to get to ratios which on numbers are lower but the amount of capital to get there is pretty unbelievable so we have twice the capital as our european counterparts of similar size and the ratios are considered to be lower so obviously as they pull this together theyve got to make sure they arent counting the beans different ways with the gold plating and other things in united states so hopefully people are starting to see the wisdom and making sure theyre careful here and well see how it play out but we dont have any special understanding steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc right thanks for taking my questions bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 operator well take our next question from matt oconnor with deutsche bank your line is open matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc good morning just a quick clarification on the balance sheet and a separate question the cash obviously went up a lot and you did allude to that moving some of the securities to cash but the shortterm borrowings was also up a lot and i didnt know if thats just to kind of hold more liquidity in the current environment and we should assume that continues which i think weighs on nim but not the nii dollars or was that just temporary in and we shouldnt pay too much attention to the periodend trend there alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp its a little bit of both matt youve got first quarter is just normally a seasonal build for us so that happens and a little bit of borrow and youre right it doesnt impact nim because you can invest in cash straight away and theres no drag there but it may hurt ph noi slightly at the margin by a little bit matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay sorry i think you meant to say it doesnt hurt the nii dollars that much but it hurts nim percent right alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp correct matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc yeah okay and then separately any kind of trend to call out in spending in march some of your peers talked about a slowdown in march and you highlighted kind of for the full quarter debit and credit card was up year overyear and total payments up any kind of intraquarter trends you want to point to brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp i think we saw in the first part of the quarter first quarter being a little bit softer and then but saw it kick back up in march so far in april its still early its probably a little lower than it was for the month of march but its a couple weeks in so weve got to be a little bit careful about that just due to the different ways vacations fall and things like that so but its over the course of last year the total spending yearoveryear increases have slowed down and i think that means thats a precursor to the economy being a little bit slower that were seeing and then frankly consumers being more careful in the use of their cash because the cash in their accounts in our accounts especially for the lower income cohorts continues to build honestly from peak last april it fell down a little bit all across the year and its built back up in the first part of this year so well see that play out theres been a bit of a delay in some of the tax returns as you know this year that pushes them from quarter to quarter but stay tuned i think its a little early to call but it is a little softer in the first part of april here matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank securities inc okay thank you very much bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 operator well go next to vivek juneja with jpmorgan your line is open vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks just a couple of questions wanted to start by the shift to interest bearing from noninterest bearing i know you said you expect that to continue do you expect the pace of that to slow or is it still its still running pretty high or even to accelerate any color on that alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah id expect it to slow over time vivek because were getting pretty close now to q4 levels anyway which was the last peak and also you think about the big driver it tends to be global banking and as rates are rising clients are doing their rotation but were getting towards the end of the hikes now we would think so youd anticipate thered be a little bit of a lag there but generally speaking id expect it to slow at some point and i think were probably getting close now vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc one more alastair office cre you gave the geographical mix in your slides for the total cre portfolio can you give us some similar thing for the office cre portfolio alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp i can do but im going to need to followup with you afterwards because i dont have it at hand vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp but i dont think youre going to find anything there other than sort of typical geographic distribution similar to the way we serve our customers around the united states vivek juneja q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay all right thanks operator well go next to gerard cassidy with rbc your line is open gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning brian good morning alastair bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc alastair can you elaborate a little further you talked about i think its slide you show us the basis point parallel shift impacts in net interest income by a positive billion over the following months if the rate environment does shift and maybe we do start to see lower rates by the end of the year how quickly can you guys move this from being asset sensitive to neutral or liability sensitive on the balance sheet alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well i think if you were to take that same metric on the downside it would be probably be down billion for down a just to give you some idea and whats happening now is obviously as the interestbearing piece just continues to rise across the company weve got a hedge now as rates if and when they start to go back down it wont be a complete hedge but it will be a little bit of a hedge there then you also get something back in terms of global markets nii that will start bleeding back positively so theres some puts and some takes but well see how that develops over the course of the year gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question in the global banking slide you guys give us slide you had a negative provision in this quarter and you referenced that its an improved macroeconomic outlook can you give us some color what youre seeing there to give you confidence to have a negative provision and then the second does this also include the recent shared national credit exam results in this line item as well brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp it would always include those results thats come through continuously theres not theres change over time thats a continuous set of things they look at and we always do well in that and when we say macro environment remember that this business set is credit across the world so theres places that we finished up on cleaning up that allowed us to lease some reserves on one side and then we had other places that we would have put up reserves but at the end of the day the overall credit quality here is very strong and very stable gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good appreciate it alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp and you asked a question on commercial correct gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp yeah okay so i mean i think theres a couple things going on number one we didnt have any real loan growth number two the asset quality remains terrific number three the macro environment when you look at the blue chip consensus was ever so slightly better so we felt we were pretty wellprovided for already and then on the commercial side we had a little bit of exposure runoff in one or two places where we may have been reserved quite conservatively so it was all those things added together gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great actually brian and alastair you guys obviously have been through a few cycles why is commercial so strong im just you and your peers all have good commercial credit quality any suggestions of what youre seeing that makes it so good alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well their profitability remains in a good place cash flows remain in a good place i think corporate america learned something from and and so leverage is in a good place you add all that up youve got a decent environment overall for the economy and thats where we are with respect to credit quality so well have to watch that over time but as of right now its in terrific shape gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc great thank you very much operator our next question comes from betsy graseck with morgan stanley your line is open betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp good morning betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc two questions one just keying off of the loan discussion just now could you give us a sense of how youre thinking about lending standards and any changes in a postsvb environment alastair borthwick a chief financial officer bank of america corp well look we dont really have a significant change to our risk appetite we havent changed our client selection those are largely speaking designed to be through the cycle we will obviously adjust on specific concerns about asset quality performance in a sector or outlook but id say with respect to our loan growth where were seeing it bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 more is as the fed raises rates those rates are changing our customer demand so we just dont see as much demand right now for securitiesbased lending or mortgage but its less about credit tightening or standards its more about just fed doing and having the effect that you would expect betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then two other quickies one on the consumer checking account balances in march was that uptick in part a function of seasonality and end of period end of pay cycle type of behavior or is there something more going on there brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp well i think as always thats a cohort of prepandemic compared to where they were then and now and they had been sort of bouncing around that level for the last six months and they moved up a little bit this is the time of the year they do move up because of tax returns and other things and yearend payments and stuff but they clearly arent going they basically are stable from november december january they start increasing in february and then they bounced up little bit so well see where it ends up what the clear message is despite people having said these consumers are spending down their money it would be out of these balances in mid or the third quarter they clearly are still sitting with a fair amount of money in their account relative to pre pandemic times betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc okay and then just lastly ai has been a big topic recently as im sure you know youve got erica just wondering about plans to leverage ai maybe youre going to be leveraging erica and that maybe its a different kind of strategy but the thoughts there would be helpful thank you brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp yeah so erica obviously the basic concept was built for us a number of years four five six seven years ago starting and came into the business it is a predictive language type of program where you put a question in and it answers it but we had to do a special language to make sure it would work with our business it wasnt a general so we did that then that then put us in a condition to start to deploy it to our customers because its captive to our data in other words its looking at our systems finding information and give it to clients is really a service capability and look so what weve seen is that that increase is a clear indicator of how valuable these types of artificial intelligence natural language processing predictive technologies can be for customer service and things like that weve also taken erica internally and applied it to help us do work and weve seen it have those benefits ultimately we think this has extreme benefits for our company we think it has a lot and youve seen this this written about in the computer coding areas in other words it can speed up the process of what used to be called object programming that goes on we think it has a lot to do in terms of allowing teammates to work much more quickly and efficiently with our systems and get information out and can make even someone like me the ability to do analytics that i have to send to somebody to have them put key it into the system so theres a lot of value to this the key question will be when can you use it without the fear of the reason why a lot of us stopped it in our industry and other industries was it wasnt clear how it worked with your data and the outside worlds data and how it would interact to pull stuff out and we have to be careful of that and then secondly we have to understand bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 how the decisions are made to be able to stand up to our customers demands for us to be fair and frankly follow the laws and rules and regulations on lending so i think all that is good strong its really an important thing so were not a neophyte in that sense actually operating out that we understand the value of it but we will carefully apply it and we see a great value i dont think its great value in the next month but in the overall sense it will help us manage the head count down which weve been doing this quarter and remember we started this company the management team started with this company in with and people working here and were running the same sized company with people a bigger company doing more stuff and so all thats been aided by digitization of which this is a potential step function change betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc thanks so much appreciate it operator well take our final question at this time this is a followup from mike mayo with wells fargo please go ahead your line is open mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi in terms of your guidance for lower expenses in the second quarter than the third quarter than the fourth quarter how much of that is expectations for slower business activity and how much of that is due to expected scale benefits from technology and i guess the bigger question too is are you seeing evidence of a banking crisis are you seeing evidence of a banking recession and is that part of the reason for the expense guide brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp no its not mike i would say there could be the activity in the first quarter it was actually higher in some ways because of volatility on the trading side and things like that so were expecting to get scale and operating leverage across activity taking less dollars to do it in the opex and the work we do we build up more people largely because not the fear of last year or the turnover rate that has now gone in half in a year and requires to be hiring a lot to stay ahead of it and then when it slow down we build up people and were bringing it back down the line but there is no the expenses frankly are just managing that account carefully because thats twothirds expense based and getting more leverage out of the activities but theres no well have more checking accounts well have more credit card accounts well do more wires on a given day well do more trades on a given day and that can ebb and flow but overall were expecting activity to continue to rise now will loan demand ie people want to borrow another versus the they had thats what we say slows down but thats not that they dont have a loan its that they borrow different amounts of money mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right so this is just really managing the business not your reduced investment spend or anything like that brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 no and on the investment spend were spending we increased this year versus last year million to million in pure initiative spending and thats going through the run rate as we speak and we wouldnt cut that because we think to the point of betsys comment it gives us a chance to continue to leverage the franchise and nowhere is that more evident than in our consumer business where the number of branches yearoveryear are down a few hundred again customers are bigger and more stuffs going through customer delight is at an all time high attrition is at an alltime low and thats what makes that franchise valuable as you well know and thats why continuing to invest in new capabilities all the time mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and last thing big picture for you brian just the evidence that a recession is coming and the impact on you guys where are you right now is it red is it flashing yellow is it green how has it moved just whats the temperature brian t moynihan a chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp candace and the research teams have been consistent to see after the fed raises rates ph as announced there would be a recession they have a mild recession and that they predicted basically say to negative annualized negative gdp growth q3 q4 and q1 and then back to positive so i think at the end of the day we dont see the activity on the consumer side slowing at a pace that would indicate that but we would see commercial customers are being more careful and things like that but everything points to relatively mild recession given the amount of stimulus that was paid to people and the money they have left over the fact that unemployment is still at this ph full employment plus and then the wage growth is slowing and tipping over so the signs of inflation tipping down but theyre still there but that translates into relatively good activity so we see as a slight recession and well see what happens but we built this company across the last decade even in the stress scenarios that you see somewhere in the slides last quarter we didnt reproduce them because theyve the same answer our stress scenarios are always less than anybody elses because of how we built the company through to go through recessions without problem including the pandemic mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc got it all right thank you operator and at this time id like to turn the program back over to brian moynihan for any additional or closing remarks brian t moynihan chairman chief executive officer bank of america corp thank you for your time and i want to thank my teammates for a great performance again this first quarter of a strong quarter of yearoveryear eps growth the strength stability and being there for our customers continued to show through including strong capital of liquidity at billion and gls but the most important thing and we just touched on it was really two things continued organic growth in our franchise and operating leverage by growing revenue faster than expenses so we feel good about that and look forward to talking to you next quarter bank of america corp bac corrected transcript q1 earnings call 18apr2023 operator this does
