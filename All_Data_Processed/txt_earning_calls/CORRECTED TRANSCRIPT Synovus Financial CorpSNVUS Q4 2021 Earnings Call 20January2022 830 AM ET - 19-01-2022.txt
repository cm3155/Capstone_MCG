yearend report is an absolute testament to your talents and passions for the inspired and purposedriven work we do that enables people to achieve their full potential what youll see today is a story of execution and followthrough of doing what we said we could and would do and in many areas doing even more as we began we focused on five core business objectives number one to regain growth momentum two to enhance the client experience by making it even easier to do business with synovus number three to provide seamless delivery of our solutions across all of our lines of business leading to a deeper wallet share and client relationships four to better leverage analytics in order to provide more informed and proactive advice and five the development and attraction of talent to support our growth initiatives we have made significant progress in all five core areas and our success in was largely driven by our execution of these business objectives moving to slide lets review the year our lines of business succeeded in delivering core performance via solid loan deposit and fee income growth while client loan demand was muted in the first half of in the second half we saw doubledigit broadbased commercial loan growth driven primarily by our wholesale bank with all wholesale sublines of business posting growth for the year funded commercial loan production increased versus and was up versus with significant productivity gains across our community and wholesale teams we expect this momentum to continue into given the pipelines and activities of our bankers as well as the incremental growth that will be provided by our key investments in talent in the middle market restaurant services and corporate and investment banking teams deposit growth was driven by continued balance augmentation as well as an ongoing sales focus on core operating accounts as a result core transaction balances have increased in the past two years we have strategically allowed higher cost lower value deposits ph to attrite with an overarching goal of remixing our funding profile to optimize lower cost deposit composition during this period of excess liquidity at yearend of total deposits were core transaction deposits versus at yearend ex security gains noninterest revenues grew led by increases in core banking fees and income from various wealth businesses this was the seventh consecutive quarter of increases in wealth fees drivers of this growth include a strong equity market as well as net new assets under management from client growth including the onboarding of new family office clients during the year in we continued to make significant progress with our synovus forward initiatives as of yearend we have achieved million in pretax run rate benefit ahead of our original projections evidence of success includes reducing real estate expenses lowering head count and a reduction of thirdparty spend all of which resulted in adjusted expenses being flat versus these synovus forward savings allowed us to make strategic and impactful investments in every area while managing overall expenses this year we will transition our synovus forward efforts into our overall strategic plan but remain committed and on pace to achieve the million synovus forward target as part of our focus on innovation we launched several new digital solutions and services including enhanced deposit online account origination accelerate ar our integrated receivable suite and gateway our commercial banking digital platform these investments have enhanced capabilities and functionality and is leading to a better overall client experience we also implemented the smart commercial analytics tool that is giving our bankers better insights into solutions our clients need early warning on client attrition and proactive risk monitoring in we also invested in synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 people in particular those who have experience and expertise to expand our advisory services and to build strong relationship value we grew our treasury and payments team which had another recordbreaking year growing sales by almost and added to specialty banking and our middle market talent in our highgrowth central and west florida regions we also continue to emphasize the development of our existing team members through the launch of two new leadership development tracks for emerging and senior leaders despite the challenges associated with the pandemic our recent voice of the team member survey indicated that of our team members were actively engaged which is topquartile relative to the financial services benchmark and we were designated a great place to work by the great place to work institute we also have made measured progress in our diversity equity and inclusion efforts by meeting our shortterm ethnicity and genderbased goals in the leadership ranks in so overall a productive and rewarding year and one that carries a tremendous amount of momentum into now let me shift to highlights from the fourth quarter lets start on slide with loan growth which increased billion or an annualized excluding ppp the growth this quarter resulted from our second consecutive quarter of record funded commercial loan production at billion this represented a increase from the third quarter the quality of growth as measured by risk ratings and underwriting metrics is consistent with the existing portfolio which continues to perform well and is supported by reversal of credit losses of million this quarter its a similar story on the other side of the balance sheet with core transaction deposit growth of billion or versus the third quarter approximately of this quarters increase came from noninterestbearing deposits the combination of balance augmentation and new account origination continues to be the drivers of growth net interest income growth was also strong this quarter as we delivered billion in earning asset growth net interest income increased million from the third quarter or excluding the reduction in ppp fees the net interest margin declined basis points in the quarter largely due to lower ppp income but the nim before ppp fees actually increased basis point as earning asset yields were fairly stable and we continued to lower deposit rates during the quarter from a fee income perspective we continue to be pleased with overall performance as the fourth quarter totaled million core banking fees have returned and exceed prepandemic levels in the fourth quarter as card and cash management income have more than offset reductions in nsf income and our core strategic segments such as wealth management continue to generate growth through aum expansion diluted earnings per share were or on an adjusted basis an increase from or adjusted per share from the same period in during the fourth quarter we successfully completed our capital plan with million of share repurchases for the fullyear we balanced core client loan growth a common dividend and million in share repurchases to achieve our target cet1 ratio of at yearend which represents the middle of our operating range target for the upcoming year jamie will now share greater detail on the key initiatives and financial results for the quarter andrew jamie gregory jr executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin ill begin on slide we ended the year with total assets of billion and loans of billion in the fourth quarter total loans excluding ppp balances were up billion or from the prior quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 bolstered by strong commercial loan growth the commercial growth was broadbased across businesses asset classes and markets and included robust production in several of our key business lines such as structured finance senior housing national accounts and commercial banking the positive momentum was also evident in cre driven by healthy industry fundamentals in our footprint we achieved this growth while adhering to our prudent underwriting standards and disciplined approach to portfolio management benefits from strategic growth initiatives are being realized and were excited about the potential of the corporate and investment banking team being led by tom dierdorff an industry veteran who joined the team in november growth momentum in q4 was also supported by reduced payoffs and increased ci line utilization which increased approximately basis points to this is the first quarter where we have seen clear evidence of an inflection towards increased utilization we also saw continued growth in commitments up or million which positions us well for economic expansion particularly in the southeast where growth is expected to exceed national averages a continued normalization of ci line utilization on todays balance sheet would result in over million in funded balances which should occur over time as liquidity subsides within our core consumer portfolio the trend remains somewhat mixed with growth in card and other consumer products being more than offset by continued declines in mortgage in aggregate core consumer balances declined million in the quarter looking outside of our core lending activities we did see a modest decline in our thirdparty portfolio in q4 as purchases were more than offset by elevated paydown activity additionally our securities portfolio ended the quarter at billion up million from the prior quarter though that growth generally ph dragged out of the overall balance sheet and remained at of total assets these portfolios will remain central to our overall balance sheet management efforts and well continue to leverage both as a means to manage our capital and our liquidity positions slide highlights the deposit trends for the fourth quarter as well as for the full year as you can see it was another very strong year for growth led by core transaction account balances which were up billion or in the fourth quarter and up billion or for the full year notably the majority of the growth for the year was in noninterestbearing deposits while weve seen continued strategic declines in time deposits for q4 our total cost of deposits continued to decline to basis points which was down basis point from the third quarter the fourth quarter also experienced seasonal inflows related to public funds while brokered deposits were relatively stable both of these portfolios experienced declines versus one year ago and we expect further declines in the first quarter as seasonal balances normalize and as we further reduce brokered balances in the first quarter we expect brokered deposits to decline by approximately billion to billion as we efficiently manage our significant liquidity position slide shows total net interest income of million in the fourth quarter or million excluding the impact of the paycheck protection program nii growth largely resulted from strong earning asset growth which began late in the third quarter and continued through the fourth quarter the net interest margin for the fourth quarter ended at a decline of basis points from the prior quarter as expected the winddown of the paycheck protection program is serving as a notable nii headwind excluding the impact of ppp the margin was stable on the quarter synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 our portfolio remains assetsensitive and stands to benefit from increases in rates across the yield curve to that end i would note that much of the loan production we saw in the second half of was variable rate the portion of our portfolio that is floating rate now stands at which helps to support our nii sensitivity estimated at an increase of for a immediate increase in rates adjusted noninterest revenue of million is highlighted on slide up million from the prior quarter this includes a onetime million increase of boli income that offset a million reduction in mortgage income wealth management continued to see an increase in fee revenue and assets under management recording their seventh consecutive quarter of growth this growth is driven by continued strong client acquisition and asset inflows from a capital markets perspective we recorded another strong quarter despite overcoming headwinds from a large onetime arranger fee in the third quarter that was not expected to repeat as our commercial segments continue their robust growth we should expect to see continued strength from arranger fees and swap income that will drive this line item on a fullyear basis nir excluding security gains increased despite headwinds driven by the normalization of mortgage revenues drivers of this growth included wealth management and core banking fees which increased and yearoveryear respectively within core banking fees commercial cash management revenue increased million or yearoveryear this growth represents the momentum within our commercial segment including the deep depository relationships we have with our core customers slide highlights total adjusted noninterest expense of million up million from the prior quarter this change included both recurring expense increases and other notable expenses that we do not believe will repeat in future quarters recurring expense increases totaled million and were driven by several factors including growth initiatives related to synovus forward investments in tech and risk infrastructure additional fdic expense and expenses related to normalized travel and entertainment spend other notable expense increases totaled million and consisted of million of incremental performance based management bonuses a million seed gift into a newly established donor advised fund and a million increase in health insurance expense driven by seasonal and pandemicrelated factors in spite of an elevated quarter of expenses we were able to manage to flat yearoveryear adjusted expenses resulting in positive operating leverage in benefits from the successful implementation of synovus forward initiatives can be seen in comparisons of key areas from to particularly in base salaries thirdparty spend and real estate spend these reductions have helped lay the groundwork for future strategic growth initiatives the credit metrics on slide show continuing improvement in all key categories the net chargeoff ratio fell basis points to while criticized and classified loans declined the npa ratio declined basis points to and the npl ratio declined basis points to past dues dropped basis point to excluding the increase from paycheck protection program loans there was a reversal of provision for credit losses of million in the fourth quarter as further improvement in the economic outlook was partially offset by significant loan growth the acl ratio excluding ppp loans declined basis points to on slide is a recap of our capital management efforts through in the fourth quarter we executed the remaining million of our authorization and in doing so we ended the quarter with our cet1 ratio at synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 for the year we retired million shares or approximately of the common shares outstanding from the end of the prior year our ongoing capital management efforts have helped maintain strong and stable capital ratios which along with core ppnr positions us well for continued balance sheet growth in for our capital plan continues the prioritization of capital for client growth while returning an appropriate amount to our shareholders in the form of a dividend that includes an increase in the quarterly common shareholder dividend by to which would first be payable in april while our plan also includes the authorization for up to million in share repurchases our capital priorities are focused on supporting core client growth and managing our cet1 ratio around the target level of as we look ahead we believe this focus on maintaining a strong capital position and prioritizing core growth is not only in the best interest of our shareholders but also our clients our communities and our broader set of stakeholders ill turn it back to kevin for greater detail that includes our outlook kevin s blair president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thanks jamie excluding the impact of million in remaining ppp balances we expect loan growth of to in this growth assumes continued strong production in commercial lending some curtailment of prepayment activity particularly in the cre portfolio and relatively stable line utilization the adjusted revenue outlook of to largely aligns with the current rate expectations assuming three fomc rate hikes and excludes the impact of ppprelated revenue overall fee income growth will be muted due to the industrywide reduction in secondary mortgage revenue however we expect continued growth in strategic fee categories including core banking fees and wealth management our adjusted expense outlook of to incorporates increases in compensation a return to prepandemic travel and business development levels and includes our strategic investments in talent and technology ex ppp we expect to continue to generate positive operating leverage in while building out the bank of the future benefits from synovus forward initiatives will continue to offset increased inflationary pressures and well remain disciplined and agile in terms of managing expense growth throughout the year one significant efficiency initiative that is underway is the closing of an additional of our branch locations with an estimated run rate savings of approximately million by yearend moving to capital as jamie shared earlier we extended the upper range of our targeted cet1 ratio by basis points providing a new range of to this range will continue to support our strategic growth objectives while maintaining more than adequate protection against significant adverse conditions if they were to arise and in the terms of capital core relationship growth remains our top priority for capital deployment while whole bank ma is not a priority we believe these expectations for support our continued progress towards becoming a sustained top quartile performer we have a tremendous amount of momentum in our core businesses and the team is performing at a very high level given the heightened levels of inflation it appears the interest rate environment will serve as a tailwind in as we continue to position the balance sheet for asset sensitivity synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 we also believe that our strategic investments will begin to drive top line growth during the year we are making good progress on the buildout of our bankingasaservice product called maast and are seeing strong talent pipelines for the corporate and investment banking buildout for all of these reasons my confidence in delivering on our business and financial objectives is very high and i know our team is poised and ready to win operator were now ready to begin qa question and answer section operator thank you well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from steven alexopoulos from jpmorgan please go ahead steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc hi good morning everyone kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning steve steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc i wanted to start so on slide the increase in production is almost off the charts when you look at that chart could you give more color on the increase was it tied to existing customers getting more active or was this share gains coming through in the quarter kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah steven its a little bit of both and when you look at the you can look at it both a significant increase in cre and when you look at the asset classes that we were able to increase production it led to growth in eight sub asset classes so we saw growth in warehouses we saw growth in the hospitality shopping senior housing and so it was really across the board now in terms of new clients versus the existing book it came from both so we continue to take share from other competitors at the same time we have seen our existing clients become a little more active from a demand standpoint similar story on the ci side strong growth there as well and if you look at it from a naics codes perspective you would see that five of the naics codes that we cover grew greater than million so very broadbased again new clients as well as existing customers line utilization actually increased about million during the quarter in ci so it was about percentage points and obviously that would have largely come from existing clients synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay thats helpful color and then to follow up so if we look at the outlook for to loan growth in without ppp i see youre calling for line utilization to hold about flat but prepayment activity to normalize so help me understand this the improved outlook for tied to increased expectations for new client onboarding or is this because you think prepayment levels are going to decline quite a bit in kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp more the former so as we look out into our forecast and our pipelines we think production levels will remain elevated as we onboard some of our new team members that will add additional incremental production to what were already doing so its much more of a production story i think when you start breaking down the balance sheet next year just look at the commercial side we think we can grow mid to high singledigit commercial loan growth next year were keeping the thirdparty consumer portfolio flat and the core consumer portfolio may shrink a little bit just based on some of the churn thats happening there so we mentioned the payoff activity because the last two quarters weve seen about billion of payoff activity we generally have averaged over the last nine quarters about billion so it was elevated by about billion we think over the year that will continue to decline we saw a lot of activity especially on the cre front given lower cap rates so we think that will subside but the bigger driver around loan growth in the mid to high singledigit commercial loan growth is around production steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc its production okay thats really helpful maybe kevin if i could squeeze one more in so you covered a lot in terms of what the company accomplished this year and i know the investor day actually but the investor day is around the corner from a revenue perspective maybe give us a bit of a teaser on the investor day like what initiatives are you most excited about for on the revenue side thanks kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp well look i think obviously the asset sensitivity that were putting ourselves in a position to be able to drive nii but from a revenue standpoint the initiatives ill start with maast we talked a lot about how the industry is changing especially around small business i think that maast is going to give us a platform to provide the software providers a very flexible configurable brandable embedded finance platform and as we talked with those software vendors they havent had an offering that combines both a bankingasaservice platform with a paymentsasaservice platform so when we look at the uniqueness of what were providing and the timing to be able to roll out our pilot in second quarter i think it has a tremendous opportunity to start to drive revenue next year now jamie mentioned in his comments that we are planning to invest in and thats about million worth of expense we think even on those initiatives well be able to record revenues that cover almost million of revenue during the year so were not looking for large paybacks but the benefit of those new initiatives will continue to build through into the second i would mention is just our corporate and investment bank we made great progress in just the short days that tom dierdorff has been with us he is building pipelines and already starting to line up talent we expect to onboard as many as team members in the second quarter of this year and those individuals will hit the ground running and also start to provide revenue synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 steven alexopoulos q analyst jpmorgan securities llc okay terrific thanks for taking my questions kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you steven operator our next question comes from michael rose from raymond james please go ahead kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning michael michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning guys how are you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning well michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc good so obviously the outlook includes some rate hikes here just wanted to get a sense for how we should think about further build in the securities portfolio assuming we do get those rates and just remind us again where the comfort level is with the size of that portfolio thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah michael thats a great question as we look forward into we do expect to build or grow the securities portfolio on the margin were at of assets today and we could see getting up to but were going to be very prudent in that and really its a reaction to all the other movements on the balance sheet as kevin mentioned were forecasting strong client loan growth we expect that to continue we expect deposit growth to allow us to continue to look at the mix of deposits but all of those considerations play together but in our base case forecast we do expect some marginal growth in the portfolio michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc okay thats helpful and then just back to loans so the range is somewhat wide which is understandable can you just help us appreciate what factors would drive you towards the upper end versus the lower end i assume its a combination of payoffs and paydowns and utilization assumptions and things like that but if you can put a finer point on it id appreciate it thanks synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah michael i think you nailed it i think the we feel very confident in the production levels and were going into assuming its going to be a very constructive economic environment obviously there are challenges still in front of us as it relates to supply chain and potentially we dont know the impact of any other pandemic influences and so we kept the range a little wider i think we were being conservative knowing that there are some things there that continue to present some challenges and more importantly i would tell you that weve kept the third parties at zero and that this year represented significant growth and if we see the same liquidity positioning that we have we had in we also know that can flex up and we havent assumed that in the forecast but its more so just some of the unknown variables that we kept the range that wide but were very confident as i mentioned in the commercial lending side we saw tremendous momentum in the fourth quarter and we think thats going to carry over into first quarter throughout this year michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful and if i can just squeeze one last then you mentioned the million authorization but i dont get the sense that you guys are going to be really active with the buyback this year obviously given some of the investments that youre making is that the right way to think about it thanks andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp that is the right way to think about it i think the fourth quarter is a really good example of how we plan to deploy capital if the environment remains as we expect in if you look at our capital generation ppnr capital generation of basis points and then you net out the dividend you have an accretion in the mid and thats exactly what we deployed to riskweighted asset the core client loan growth in the fourth quarter now thats a pretty high growth rate but thats the context of how we will look to manage it is to deploy the capital we generate through earnings to our clients on balance sheet and then we will use share repurchases as a toggle on the backend to manage our capital cet1 ratios to the target michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc very helpful thanks for taking my questions andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you michael operator our next question comes from ebrahim poonawala from bank of america synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just on loan growth and maybe its just me but in a world where like nominal gdp is going to be maybe in things are reopening shouldnt loans growth be much stronger given all the investments you made given the franchise exposure to atlanta florida just talk to us in terms of upside risks and also if you could remind us what normalization in line utilization implies for loan balances i know its not baked into your forecast but itll be a good number to have in terms of what loan balances could look like if things actually normalize kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp ebrahim ill start with that we with the slight increase that we saw in the fourth quarter if things normalize back into that mid40 range were talking about another millionplus in outstandings and were not including that in our forecast so back to your point in terms of if we saw gdp growth i think you would see line utilization increase and again not included in our assumptions we went into our forecasting for next year assuming gdp in the to range and we think that if the economy is stronger than that obviously to your point there could be upside i just mentioned that theres upside if we decide to deploy additional capital and liquidity into the thirdparty partnership loans and our bankers have continued to produce at a higher level than what we thought so the real driver there is the productivity level of our bankers and youre right we have markets that are performing very well atlanta continues to perform very well and were bringing on new talent in florida in our corporate and investment banking world and so the faster that those individuals on board additional talent and we built budget for that the faster the loan growth will come and so there are a lot of variables we wanted to see and forecast what we see in front of us based on the economic forecast that we have and based on the team members and the expectations for those folks but obviously there is an opportunity to outperform if we hit on all those cylinders ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful kevin thank you and just on a separate question i see your adjusted revenue guidance but if we can just unpack the fee revenue outlook obviously youre building out the corporate and investment bank give us a sense of the puts and takes around the fee revenue is that going to outperform underperform that adjusted revenue guidance and what the puts and takes are synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim as we look forward into on the on fee revenue we do expect fee revenue to be down yearoveryear and the reason for that is there are headwinds in mortgage as you look at the normalization of mortgage and you still have those strong quarters in early so we expect mortgage revenue to be down higher interest rates will impact production there but then we also had benefits in fee revenue in both boli income as well as equity gains in that were not expecting to recur in so those are more environmental headwinds but i wouldnt i dont want that to take away from the broad based growth that we expect to see in really every other line item outside of nsf as we look forward into i mean our core banking fees deposit service charge card fees were expecting broadbased growth across the board outside of those both unique to headwinds and the mortgage normalization ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i can just sneak in one followup on that investment bank buildout and im assuming you have some of this saved for the investor day but just give us a sense of the rampup in terms of hiring that youre doing right now and are there any certain verticals that youre particularly focused on as you build that out kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah ebrahim so we are focusing on three initial verticals tech and media communications healthcare and the financial institutions group and one of the things that weve asked tom to do is to time this such that as you know the time of the year were not recruiting people to come in today were waiting for them to finish out their year and receive their bonus payments from their previous institution and so you would expect to see probably as i said folks join us in the second quarter maybe even early third quarter from a timing standpoint and so were looking for teams of individuals to fit those specific industry verticals and to your point on fee income i think what youre going to see in the beginning is a lot of coverage banking so youre going to see the traditional lending capabilities with our syndicated finance opportunity to offload some of those outstandings youre going to see the depository and treasury business first now over time well continue to build out some of the capital market solutions that those size clients need and so it would be an increased debt capital markets capability it may be things like securitizations but originally these guys are going to focus on just the coverage banking side so youll see it more on the nii side than what youll see on the fee income side to begin with ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i assume that some of this hiring is baked into your expense guide for the year that you provided kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp it all is and so as i mentioned earlier we have included about million for all of our investments in the expense guidance and that includes things like cib it includes maast but it also includes building out our middle market teams in florida so our guidance that we provided you would be inclusive of all of those investments and as i mentioned earlier we think that million could generate as much as million of revenue next year so you can see its a fairly quick payback period when we make those investments synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats helpful thank you operator the next question comes from brad milsaps from piper sandler please go ahead brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co thanks for taking my questions jamie i was just curious if you could offer maybe a little more color around just how assetsensitive you are i know you give the interest rate table in the deck but i was curious if you could maybe define just maybe in basis points kind of what you feel like each rate increase would have in terms of impacting the nim and then how much are rates a part i know you have three in there but maybe on a percentage basis what percentage of that of your revenue guidance in that would be related to rates andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah so first off as you can look at our core balance sheet and you look at the ratio of floating rate loans to total loans you can see that increasing over time so our native asset sensitivity is increasing and were pleased with that given our outlook for interest rates further the exposure relative exposure to the frontend of the curve will increase as longterm rates increase and premium amortization declines so youll see that happening as we have these increases and longerterm interest rates that were seeing but as of yearend and thats what our metrics are in the earnings deck our relative exposure between the short and the long end of the curve was relatively balanced when you assume a beta and thats our throughthe cycle estimate thats embedded in our nii sensitivity tables but we believe its likely depending on the velocity and the magnitude of rate moves that the deposit beta is lower in the initial stages of a fed tightening cycle and so if you were to isolate that sensitivity to the frontend of the curve and hold the backend of the curve constant and use a beta for example and thats whats consistent with our revenue guidance we would expect the margin to expand approximately basis points in the first rate move and basis points thereafter and to your question around the total impact as far as our guidance of to revenue growth our expectations for rate moves are april august december so obviously december does not have much of an impact for this year but you can think about the partial year impact of april and august and its less than of that total revenue brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 great thank you and then just as my followup just on the credit side of the equation you guys were around basis points of chargeoffs for the year i think thats pretty well in line with your to basis points any change in the way youre thinking about that in and it looks like youve kind of exhausted most of your ability to take down the reserve but just any comments around that would be helpful as well andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp no changes in our outlook mediumterm outlook for chargeoffs youre right the low area is a good baseline as we look forward to with regards to the allowance and our life of loan estimates in our cecl calculations if the economic outlook continues to improve and uncertainty declines in the outlook then we do still expect to see the acl to loan ratio to decline to approximately the day one levels for us that was obviously the loan mix is a little bit different today than it was back a couple of years ago but we do believe that day one levels are an appropriate outlook for the mediumterm brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thank you operator the next question comes from jennifer demba from truist securities please go ahead jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks good morning back to the topic kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc back to the topic of cib kevin how much loan and fee income growth you think this can represent for synovus over the next few years can you kind of size the opportunity for us kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah yeah jennifer i think what weve said is that we think in the first three years this can contribute upwards of billion of loans from a commitment standpoint but all of that is predicated on the fact that we recruit the synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 teams that were targeting and we bring them in within the timeframes that weve established but this can be a meaningful impact to our overall balance sheet but based on the size of our balance sheet you can see that its obviously going to be less than of total loans but from a fee income standpoint as i mentioned earlier its going to start off as being a relatively more of a nii story just based on the coverage nature of these bankers but over time well continue to add capabilities and just the size of their business from a treasury standpoint there will be fee income thats generated there but we havent shared at this point because its such a tough number to be able to provide without knowing the timing and the size of the teams that well be able to onboard jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc how are you finding the recruiting environment for this effort in todays landscape given were seeing so much wage inflation right now kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp just in cib jennifer jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc yes and other lines if you want to cover that kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah yeah well look i think the way in which you recruit in environments like this number one is you have to offer up a platform for which bankers want to come and work at and one of the reasons that tom dierdorff came here and hes going to be at our investor day so youll get a chance to meet him was the attraction of being able to come to a bank that is of our size that has the capabilities and functionality that we have but provides an environment that allows those bankers to really serve their clients and so our platform is very attractive to those bankers especially from a corporate and investment banking side two salary is obviously important and youll hear that from us as we look at our expense guidance we recognize the changing landscape around salary inflation but i dont think thats the most important thing we have to provide an incentive plan that allows individuals to be paid for their success and were building that as we speak and then that will attract folks here and then lastly i would tell you that the people like tom who are well respected leaders in the industry they attract people because they know that these individuals have that tom has a great track record of success and that they want to come work for folks like him so if you have the right leaders you have the right comp packages and you give them the right platform you can attract top talent from around the industry jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thanks so much operator the next question comes from brody preston from stephens inc please go ahead synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning brody brody preston q analyst stephens inc hey so i wanted to follow up on the fee income comment jamie you said you expect it to be down this year and i know that includes some securities gains and some onetimeish boli but i guess if we strip all of that out i have you guys at like million in core fee income this quarter and so just given the pipeline on maast given all the investments youve made investments youve made on the fee income side of the house maybe setting cib aside because i know thats a longer tail on that revenue source but i guess im struggling to see why the revenue guide would be down from here because it would kind of imply that that million is what youre expecting for the run rate for next year at least on a core basis and so maybe just some greater clarity there setting aside kind of the onetime items would be helpful andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah yeah good question and to dive into that a little bit we still if you look at the growth in wealth management fees its a sustained growth rate if you look at our core banking fees we feel really good about the sustained growth rate of those businesses and even core banking fees that had a really strong were expecting those to continue increasing in the high singledigits in and so we do expect to see this broad based growth continue and the headwinds though are fairly significant you have approximately a million yearoveryear change in boli income you have a little less than million on gains on equity investments and then you have normalization of mortgage and in percentage terms these are large headwinds and they have nothing to do with our core business performance of what were doing but they are headwinds when you have when youre comparing yearoveryear and so we believe that initiatives like maast we believe that initiatives like cib when you think about the fee revenue in that business we believe those will all be tailwinds to nir growth but as kevin just mentioned thats likely to be a little delayed than just coming in and having a fullyear benefit and so we will speak more to the financial statement impact longer term in a couple of weeks when we have investor day but that we believe that we have a platform thats actually proven to have sustainable strong fee revenue growth and were going to augment that with these strategic initiatives unfortunately in we have this headwind of mortgage normalization and then these other oneoffs in equity investments and boli so thats kind of a little deeper dive into the full story brody preston q analyst stephens inc synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 okay got it and then maybe just on the expense front so if i strip out all the onetime items including the donation that you all set up ive got core expenses running about million or so and so looking at the guidance slide and looking at fourth quarter results it kind of implies that you would expect expenses to be flattish from this fourth quarter level on average throughout the rest of the year just taking the midpoint of the guidance is that an accurate assessment and i guess is there anything beyond the branch closures you noted earlier kevin that are driving that andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah thats a fair assumption and another way to look at that is if you roll forward from the third quarter and then add what we define as recurring expenses the million in our presentation you get to the mid and what you should expect to see in the first quarter is the normal seasonal employment expenses approximately million and you add that on and so to your point that gets you into the low and we believe that beyond the first quarter thats when you will start to see the normal inflationary pressures that come from employment expense merit increases et cetera but also i would just included in that guidance as kevin mentioned is approximately million of spend on these growth initiatives so what you see in there is growth initiatives spend normal personnel expense increases rolling forward from the end of this year kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp and i would just add brody from a synovus forward standpoint we have in the appendix slide there that you can see we have another million to million of savings that will come in throughout the year we referenced the million on branch we have other savings as it relates to thirdparty spend and smaller items that add up to that number but to be very clear as jamie mentioned were going to be monitoring the expenses throughout the year i think weve proven this year weve been able to go through a year and have our expenses flat and so when you take our guidance for next year and this year over a twoyear period thats seen some of the highest inflation that ive seen in my time in banking well be able to keep our total expense growth over that two years into that to growth range so well continue to pull the levers we have to pull weve been very i think forthright in some of the initiatives that weve already executed on thats delivered million in expense reductions our head count is down yearoveryear and so we know that we have to look at the environment and every dollar that we can generate a new efficiency initiative from it allows us to either drop it to the bottom line or invest more in some of these strategic initiatives that weve established brody preston q analyst stephens inc got it thank you for that and if i could sneak just a quick one in could you remind me what the effective duration on the securities portfolio and then do you happen to know what percent of the securities portfolio is floating rate andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp the duration of the securities portfolio is just under years approximately years i dont have the percent thats floating rate top of hand but we will get that to you synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 brody preston q analyst stephens inc all right thank you very much operator our next question comes from jared shaw from wells fargo securities please go ahead jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning jared andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc just following up on the growth targets how do you expect whats your view for funding on that in terms of the expectation for deposit growth as well as cash deployment into those loan categories and looking at some of those more optional areas you talked about like the thirdparty originators is that really more going to be dependent upon liquidity than anything else andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp yeah as we look at funding the loan growth were in a very strong liquidity position and so we do expect there to be a deposit growth tailwind that continues in but we believe that even with this growth outlook and how were thinking about asset growth in including the securities growth that we will still have the opportunity to improve our deposit mix and so what you should expect to see from us is core transaction deposit growth being net with a continued reduction in brokered deposits continued reduction in time deposits as we manage that mix and so we believe that we have plenty of flexibility to do that and thats our outlook for funding the loan growth with regards to the thirdparty portfolio we do view that as a surrogate for the investment portfolio and we will look to deploy assets into thirdparty loans as appropriate and you can see in the third i mean in the fourth quarter that that portfolio was down quarteronquarter but thats largely due to the fact that we didnt feel compelled to invest and chase assets in that portfolio when we had such strong client loan growth which is our priority jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thanks and then just on the expense savings coming from the branch optimization should we expect that thats equally spread throughout the year or is that really more backend loaded synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp thats right itll be evenly spread throughout the year jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thank you operator the next question comes from kevin fitzsimmons from da davidson please go ahead kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co hey good morning everyone andrew jamie gregory jr a executive vice president chief financial officer synovus financial corp good morning kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp good morning kevin kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co most of my questions have been asked but one thing thats im just curious about when thinking about the franchise kevin looking i know this year the focus is really on finalizing or getting the finished savings from synovus forward and these investments in cib and other areas but when you and i appreciate your comment about ma that thats really not a focus for you all but when you think about the prospect of bolting on certain markets say in north carolina maybe thats not an opportunity for this year maybe its more next year if you dont go about it or if you want to avoid ma is it on the radar at all to look to do liftouts of teams in certain metro markets in north carolina and to those seem like they would be very attractive markets for you to add from a banking perspective but maybe the investments are really or the opportunity for investing is spoken for in maybe this is more of a or beyond item but just wondering how you think of that long term that prospect thanks kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah kevin its a great question because i think that as we transform back into this growth orientation there is a lot of opportunities to expand our talent we actually do have a small loan production office in charlotte today but its not a meaningful portfolio my belief is that i would rather go out and build industry expertise through some of our specialty verticals and have those individuals not be limited by geography so that technically they can be national in their portfolio versus constraining a new lpo in a north carolina market because i think that its very difficult i believe to go in with a generalist banker in a marketplace where you dont have a strong brand and generate the type of value that i think we are generating with some of these specialty industry vertical hires that weve been able to make synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 so although i would never say never it would be low on my priorities i think we have a tremendous opportunity first and foremost to continue to invest in the fivestate footprint that we serve we continue to be able to pick up great talent from other institutions that are creating growth in our existing markets weve announced recently two great hires in the middle market space in florida so were going to focus inside our footprint were going to continue to add some specialty skill set around the industry verticals and then down the road never say never but its just not a top priority kevin patrick fitzsimmons q analyst da davidson co got it great thanks very much guys kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thank you operator operator instructions our next question comes from christopher marinac from janney montgomery scott please go ahead christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc audio gap all the information this morning kevin just want to ask about the pipeline in the wealth management space you mentioned the family office growth in just curious kind of what the pipeline looks like for the next several quarters kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah i mean phenomenal growth there chris so when you look at the folks our synovus family office has an asset under management portfolio of about billion so i think that their execution that they had this past year is indicative of the type of skill set we have in that team but it also is a function of the way in which they go to market theyre not just asset managers these are our offering there is a business that goes out into these generational families and provides full service and i think it is a unique value proposition and weve won a lot of awards for being recognized for being unique so i think youll continue to see that business grow our leader there katherine dunlevie set out a plan several years ago to double the size of her business and shes well on track in being able to deliver on that so we are confident that she will continue to grow that business and itll be something that will continue to provide not only growth on the fee side but also on the assets under management side christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great kevin thanks for that and my quick followup just has to do with the new receivable business and i guess im curious is that something thats digitizing what already exists at synovus or is it a brand new product offering synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp i missed the first part chris christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc for the new receivable business kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp oh christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc i know were going to get into detail in a couple weeks kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp yeah christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc but just curious if thats digitizing something that already exists or is it brand new kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp thats right no its brand new so what were providing is a suite of products for our clients to better manage their receivable process so imagine today you have a clerk whos matching invoices with payments and the product that we provide provides artificial intelligence that allows that process to happen behind the scene so it makes our clients much more efficient and not needing clerks to do that and it makes it obviously a quicker process in general so we built a really strong pipeline with that product and were out selling it to our clients today the really exciting part is well have a similar product for the accounts payable side that well roll out in the latter half of that will provide a similar functionality for commercial payments platforms christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great so over time thats going to lead to additional loan to business in addition to additional fees as this gets executed right kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp absolutely i think we said last quarter our pipeline with the accelerate ar was right around million in product revenue and so over time those will continue to grow and thats whats going to fuel a lot of our treasury growth synovus financial corp snv corrected transcript q4 earnings call 20jan2022 going forward to this point katherine weislogel and her team have done a great job of deepening the wallet share within treasury we now are starting to expand with these new businesses where shes getting a new sandbox to play in but shes also adding new solutions that will also add to that revenue line so its really the threelegged stool crosssell into the existing book expand through new segments and industries and three bring on new solutions and products christopher marinac q analyst janney montgomery scott llc great thanks for the background kevin i appreciate it kevin s blair a president chief executive officer director synovus financial corp great operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mr kevin blair for any closing remarks thank you kevin s
