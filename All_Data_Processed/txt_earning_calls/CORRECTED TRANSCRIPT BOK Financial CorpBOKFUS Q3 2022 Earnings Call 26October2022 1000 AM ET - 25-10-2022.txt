thanks for joining us to discuss bok financials third quarter financial results starting on slide third quarter net income was million or per diluted share results reflected another very strong quarter that demonstrates our diverse earnings mix the third quarter ranks as the third highest in the banks earnings history trailing only the second and third quarters of both of which had negative loan loss provisions bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 preprovision net revenue increased million linked quarter as we grew core loans experienced significant margin expansion and benefited from our diverse feeincome base shortterm interest rates continued to rise during the quarter and our asset sensitive balance sheet responded accordingly our net interest margin increased basis points linked quarter due to loan portfolio that is heavily weighted to variable rate loans fee income increased linked quarter as institutional trading took advantage of favorable market conditions and investment banking set a quarterly record for fee income primarily in municipals our asset quality credit trends remain unsustainably good but we did add to our credit loss reserve this quarter in recognition of the loan growth and less certainty in the economic outlook turning to slide periodend core loan balances increased million or linked quarter with commercial real estate the primary driver overall unfunded loan commitments continue to grow up billion linked quarter with utilization rates still low while average deposits continue to remain high compared to prepandemic levels we saw a decrease of billion or this quarter with virtually all of that in interestbearing balances these declines were consistent or even better than our expectations given the rapid actions of the federal reserve to move shortterm rates higher the third quarter loantodeposit ratio increased to from last quarter assets under management or administration were relatively flat linked quarter at billion and are down compared to last year driven by market impact on equities which comprise approximately a third of the total ill provide additional perspective on the results before starting the qa session but now marc maun will review the loan portfolio and our credit metrics in more detail ill turn the call over to marc marc c maun executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp thanks stacy turning to slide periodend loans in our core loan portfolio were billion up linked quarter yearoveryear core loans have now grown billion or total ci loans were relatively flat linked quarter with growth in healthcare and general business offset by declines in energy and services growth trends in commercial real estate loans are traditionally lumpy as evidenced by this quarters strong result linked quarter balances increased million or with million of the increase from loans secured by multifamily residential properties and million increase in loans secured by industrial facilities unfunded commercial real estate commitments increased linked quarter so yearoveryear commercial real estate balances increased consistent with the rest of our lending businesses healthcare balances increased million or linked quarter primarily driven by our senior housing and hospital acute care sectors healthcare unfunded commitments increased linked quarter which we expect will drive additional balance growth energy balances declined million this quarter but have increased million or yearoveryear unfunded commitments increased just over linked quarter resulting in an average utilization rate of approximately creating more capacity for continued balance sheet growth services and general business loans did decline linked quarter but have increased million or compared to september unfunded commitments in the combined services and general business categories increased linked quarter slightly lowering utilization rate utilization rates continued to run below precovid levels so we still have significant capacity to increase the outstanding loan balances without it being predicated on any new customer acquisition over the last months core loans have grown billion or just under with annualized yeartodate growth of just over for although we dont expect loan growth bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 to continue at this pace we believe that the momentum weve experienced up to this point will continue as we close out the year and roll into now turning to slide you can see that credit quality continues to be exceptionally good across the loan portfolio nonaccrual loans increased million in the third quarter primarily due to two loans one in healthcare and another in services our criticized assets continued to decline and as a percentage of tangible equity and loan loss reserves remain at levels not seen in the last years we took a million provision for expected credit losses this quarter considering continued strong loan growth and changes in our reasonable and supportable economic forecast which were primarily related to a more challenging economic outlook from the federal reserves continued actions to control inflation given our solid credit position today a ratio of capital allocated to commercial real estate thats substantially less than our peers and a history of outperformance during past credit cycles we believe we are wellpositioned should another economic slowdown materialize in the quarters ahead we realized net chargeoffs of only during third quarter net chargeoffs have dropped to an average of basis points over the past four trailing quarters which is far below our historic loss range of basis points to basis points looking forward we expect net chargeoffs to continue to be low the combined allowance for credit losses was million or of outstanding loans at quarterend we expect to maintain this ratio or to migrate slightly upward as we expect strong loan growth to continue as well as continued economic uncertainty due to market conditions as the fed pursues their goal of reining in inflation both of these conditions support credit provisions going forward now ill turn the call over to scott scott bradley grauer chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp thanks marc turning to slide total fees and commissions were million for the third quarter a million linkedquarter increase trading fees increased million linked quarter as we took advantage of favorable market conditions and increased market volatility our commodity and hedging activities were flat linked quarter at million but actually set a new quarterly record slightly topping last quarters record our bankwide investment banking activities also established a new record quarter with fees increasing million to million led by record results from our municipal investment banking segment while lumpy in their timing the combination of our investment banking activities from our wealth and commercial segments provide another solid source of diversified revenues fiduciary and asset management fees were relatively flat linked quarter with a increase the second quarter included seasonal tax preparation fees creating a linkedquarter decline that was offset by reduced fee waivers in our cavanal hill funds driven by the increase in shortterm interest rates we have now eliminated all of our fee waivers our assets under management or administration were virtually flat linked quarter at billion despite a linkedquarter decline in equities our current mix of assets under management are fixed income equities cash and alternatives bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 our relationshipcentric model and product offering continues to serve our clients needs today as we help them manage market volatility deposit service charges increased slightly this quarter with growth driven primarily from our consumer segment yeartodate approximately of deposit service charge fees were consumerrelated overdraft program fees were implementing changes to our overdraft program in the fourth quarter that will reduce those consumer fees by approximately million per quarter mortgage banking revenue was flat linked quarter with production revenues down million due to a million decline in production volumes combined with narrowing margins mortgage servicing fees increased million this quarter and are higher than third quarter last year during the last months weve strategically acquired servicing of approximately billion of unpaid principal balances that will add million of annual servicing revenue ill now turn over the call to steven to highlight our net interest margin dynamics and the important balance sheet items for the quarter steven steven e nell executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you scott turning to slide third quarter net interest revenue was million a million increase from last quarter interest and fees on loans increased million largely due to a basis point increase in loan yield loan yields increased as our variable rate loans repriced in response to the recent increase in shortterm interest rates our balance sheet is asset sensitive with the majority of our commercial and commercial real estate loans repricing in a year or less interest income on securities increased million linked quarter interest income on securities increased million linked quarter as average yields increased basis points primarily due to higher yields on the trading portfolio and higher reinvestment rates on our available for sale portfolio total interest expense increased million linked quarter primarily due to a basis point increase in the average rate of interestbearing liabilities while those related average balances fell billion the average effective rate on the interestbearing deposits increased basis points this quarter average earning assets decreased million compared to the last quarter average loans increased million offset by a million decline in the trading securities portfolio average total deposits declined billion with materially all of that from interestbearing balances which was consistent with our expectations given the upward trend longterm rates net interest margin was a basis point increase linked quarter with the increase driven by basis point increase and then it ph fed new spread and the basis point increase in the benefit from non interestbearing funding sources with our current asset sensitive position and given expectations for further increases in shortterm rates we expect to capture significant benefit in the fourth quarter and into turning to slide we highlight further our asset sensitive balance sheet position and expect our performance in a rising rate environment to be similar to that experienced during the last rate hiking cycle from to using our standard modeling assuming a parallel shift up basis points gradually over months relative to rates raise as of the end of the third quarter net interest revenue would increase or approximately million over the following months the total benefit increase is or million asset sensitivity for the first months would be reduced to an approximately neutral position in a flattening scenario where shortterm rates increase basis points while long end rates increase basis points ill provide more color in a moment when i talk about our specific forward guidance for net interest margin bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 on slide you can see that our liquidity position remains very strong our loan to deposit ratio increased to this quarter from at june due to the combined impact of a billion decrease in total deposits and a million increase in loan balances this quarter our sufficient on balance sheet liquidity has us well positioned to meet future increasing customer loan demand our capital position remains strong as well with a common equity tier ratio of well above regulatory threshold with such strong capital levels we once again were active with share repurchases opportunistically repurchasing  at an average price of per share in the open market we expect to be active in repurchasing shares during the fourth quarter turning to slide yearoveryear total expenses increased only with a decline in personnel expense and a increase in nonpersonnel linked quarter total expenses increased million million of the linked quarter increase comes from personnel expense with million of that increase related to deferred and sharebased compensation these categories are influenced by market valuations and forecasted annual results compared to a peer group and can move around quartertoquarter linked quarter cashbased incentives also grew million due to the strong sales results in our commercial and wealth segment nonpersonnel expense increased million linked quarter with professional fees and occupancy as the primary drivers project related spend drives the professional fee increase while the increase in occupancy is seasonal related to annual common area maintenance charges combined with increased utility cost given that we have met or exceeded the guidance for key balance sheet and earnings drivers that we identified for the forecast and assumptions will focus on the next months we are not ready to provide more formal assumptions for as that remains a work in progress for us but i do think the following key assumptions may be helpful given our level of earnings outperformance over the last couple of quarters we currently expect mid to upper singledigit annualized loan growth our geographic footprint remains very strong and may outperform in this cycle given the high level of business migration from other markets and the role energy plays in our footprint we have a strong base of core deposits and expect demand deposits to remain relatively stable while our loan to deposit ratio migrates over time we follow the forward curve when modeling our rate outlook currently were assuming a basis point increase in november and december and a basis point increase in february of before the federal reserve pauses we believe the margin could migrate to or modestly higher in the first half of before stabilizing and declining modestly due to the lag effect of deposit betas the september net interest margin was operating revenue is very diverse and some components are market dependent and even countercyclical but we expect total operating revenue should be in a range between the second quarter and the third quarter reported amounts we expect expenses to rise over the next five quarters but not at the level of revenue growth this will allow the efficiency ratio to stay below which changes driven up or down by the revenue mix in each period our allowance level is above the medium of our peers and we expect to maintain a strong credit reserve with a less certain economy current asset quality is very strong and does not foreshadow material deterioration but this could change as the economic outlook becomes more clear we expect to continue our quarterly share repurchases ill now turn the call back to stacy kymes for closing commentary bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 stacy c kymes president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thanks steven third quarter results are very exciting and an excellent example of how the bank operating model is positioned for earnings growth in this environment we are experiencing benefit from our asset sensitive balance sheet position consistent quarterly loan growth across our geographic footprint and across business line sectors as well as our diverse fee base we are positioned to benefit from various market conditions rising shortterm interest rates had a negative impact on our mortgage related business but have significantly benefited our lending areas and related margin markets have negatively impacted our assets under management the volatility has benefited our trading and commodities businesses offering a broad selection of products to our client base is producing the top line revenue growth we set our focus on at the beginning of the year we expect the federal reserve to continue their aggressive inflation fighting strategy with further increases to shortterm interest rates which will drive further margin expansion and revenue for the bank credit quality continues to be very stable and better than prepandemic levels though it is likely unsustainable we continue to maintain a combined allowance above the median of our peers as we institutionally believe in strong credit reserves in less certain times we are in a stage where the outcome of investing in strong banks versus trading in the sector is expected to matter banks with thoughtful growth a diverse business mix meaningful core deposits and proven credit discipline should outperform we are wellpositioned however the economy should shift favorable or negatively in the coming year with that we are pleased to take your questions operator bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you at this time we will be conducting a questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from jared shaw with wells fargo securities please proceed with your question jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc hey everybody good morning stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning jared steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hey jared jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc maybe starting with the loan growth outlook can you share some of the i guess assumptions for what you think utilization rates do with that and then maybe more broadly what youre hearing from your customers in terms of sentiment and desire to i guess invest new money in this environment and whether thats more broadly across the whole group of even more specifically on the energy side stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp sure jared let me try to address both of those and if i missed something just feel free to followup but first of all as we look at utilization that really didnt factor significantly into how we were thinking about the next months in terms of the loan guidance clearly from my perspective enhancement and utilization would accelerate the loan growth were not seeing really material changes in utilization at all were still well below where we were broadly prepandemic so theres material opportunity for moving loan growth even higher than what we estimated if utilization rates began to move up meaningfully as it relates to customer and borrower sentiment i would tell you in my career i cant remember a different time in terms of what you saw and heard on the financial media versus what were talking about with our customers customers are is optimistic about their business that ive heard them talk about in many many years i dont know if its our footprint we have a really fantastic growth footprint with texas and phoenix and denver as kind of core growth markets for us i dont know if its the energy piece where i think we are benefiting from a bit higher energy sustained higher energy prices in our core markets of colorado texas oklahoma and even new mexico but borrower sentiment is very very positive theyre clearly dealing with labor and supply chain issues but those are those seem to be getting better and theyre able to price and have margins in their business that help them accommodate those higher labor costs or supply chain challenges so theres a real shifting sentiment i think bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 between what we hear from people on the ground who are running their businesses every day in our markets versus perhaps what the financial press would have us believe is a near recession or recessionary environment jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats great color thanks and then maybe shifting to the outlook on margin what are some of the assumptions around beta through the cycle now with now that youve seen sort of a good quarter of reallife example and as we look at dda when you say thats stable are you saying stable as dollars or stable as a percentage of the mix i guess and how does that factor into the beta outlook steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah jared this is steven the latter part of your question there about deposits and demand deposits i think were talking about as a percentage i mean i we may expect a little bit of deposit attrition in the fourth quarter just like we did in the third ddas have been very stable theyre staying around of our entire deposit base i think that we can we feel like thatll be the what well play out in the fourth quarter deposit betas for the third quarter were around theyll probably migrate a little higher in the fourth quarter maybe towards or will range somewhere through the cycle at the end of the year maybe between and so you put this in context weve got to slightly below loantodeposit ratios weve got room here to be opportunistic if we want to be our funding levels are great but certainly well need to migrate i would say betas a little bit higher with the market stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp and this is stacy i think theres always a focus on deposit betas and understandably so in the cycle but our loan betas have been pretty strong given the variable nature of our loan portfolio and so were really benefiting from that as well as control deposit costs as we move forward which is why we were able to guide related to our margin to a much higher level than we are today we ended september higher than we did with our ended september higher than we did for the quarter and were optimistic about the margin as we move into jared shaw q analyst wells fargo securities llc great thanks a lot operator our next question is from brady gailey with kbw please proceed with your question brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc hey thanks good morning guys stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp hi brady bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc i just wanted to start with some average earning asset balances and if you look at the bond book and the trading security portfolio both of those have been have been trending down yeartodate do you expect those to be close to stable or do you think those balances will continue to somewhat trend down as loans grow steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well the afs portfolio excuse me is down but part of that is because we shifted some to held to maturity last quarter so that may be part of what youre seeing there i really dont expect afs securities to go down in fact i think weve got a pretty decent opportunity with mortgage spreads moving into the fourth quarter and part of next year we may actually grow that portfolio a bit which i think would serve two purposes i think wed get some good spread on that portfolio but we would also use that to migrate back a little bit more towards neutral as we get towards perhaps the end of the rate hike cycle on the trading portfolio scott can talk a little bit about that but it was down on average but the margin is really good in that business so scott can talk a little bit about the outlook for balances and the outlook for that business scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp yeah so brady this is scott i think that steven summarized is it well i think that in terms of our trading balances i think theyve stabilized and we were able and really our team has done a great job on the desk particularly in the mortgage space of maximizing the opportunities as the daytoday volatility has widened with our spreads so weve been able to produce results with lower balances there as kind of the institutional market is waiting for the settling period where rates have kind of set begin to settle in so to the extent that we get a little bit more predictability in the outlook for rates and the fed moves i think what well see is well settle in to maybe a little bit higher balances on that as the market settles out of it but right now with the volatility thats there we think that its advantageous for us to be a little bit more opportunistic and take advantage of that volatility on various days stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp scott you may also comment i mean the diversity of that trading revenue has changed a bit over the last months scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp sure so when you look at the total revenues generated from our securities portfolio on our institutional desks clearly mortgagebacked securities continue to command about of our total revenue mix on the trade desk bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 side but weve seen our municipal activity consistently inching up to where its now edging in at roughly of that revenue mix so weve seen increase there and weve seen for obvious reasons the emergent of treasury volumes and treasury activities as all investors across the size scale are taking advantage of the rates and the yields available in the treasury market itself so that mix has continued to evolve and change and as stacy mentioned weve dominated that mix in the mortgagebacked securities side for years but as that sector has experienced challenge and lower volumes and flows weve been able to pivot and take advantage of other spaces and other sectors in the fixed income market brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right then my second question was just on capital your common equity tier is almost so you guys clearly have excess capital is there a target in mind that you would like to get that common equity tier down to im just trying to figure out youre pointing us to more buybacks in the fourth quarter but stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp yeah brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc could buybacks continue at a material pace for the next few years steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think they could yeah we dont really have a target that were shooting for necessarily theres a lot of factors that go into that but i was really happy to grow capital this quarter i mean we had the earnings of course but we bought back million of stock paid a million dividend and supported all of the loan growth which was around and still grew capital levels so im very happy with that im happy with the levels it gives us a lot of room if we want to use some of that capital for buyback in the future which well do so were staged pretty well from a capital perspective brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc all right and then finally for me just on the reserve ratio it was up a little bit linked quarter up about basis points as the economy potentially continues to weaken here do you expect that ratio to kind of continue to trend higher marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp this is marc i would say that well monitor what we think is going on in the economy and make our economic forecast accordingly and is it if it creates more uncertainty or the downside case becomes more viable then it might have an impact on that ratio but loan growth was the primary driver for it and certainly some on uncertainty but the asset quality continues to be exceptionally good and while it may be unsustainable in a more difficult economy its at a level that we feel very comfortable given the size of the reserve that we are well bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 positioned to deal with any issues that might arise from that so i wouldnt see itll depend a little bit on what we see in the economic outlook brady gailey q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc okay great nice quarter thank you guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp thank you operator our next question is from brett rabatin with hovde group please proceed with your question brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc hey guys good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hi brett stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp good morning brett brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc i wanted to go back to fee income for a second and just talk about the in particular the brokerage and trading and just thinking about like obviously a really strong quarter in can you just talk about like how you think a sustainable level of that business might be and maybe how to think about the related compensation that obviously dropped through to personnel stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp certainly steven and scott can discuss any specifics you have but i think broadly what we were trying to do with the guidance we provided was indicate that theres lots of categories inside of our noninterest revenue and they move around from quartertoquarter and so providing guidance on specific categories is difficult but when you start to look at it in total its a little easier to guide to and so we had a strong second quarter we had a great third quarter on noninterest revenue and so if you look at the guidance that steven discussed in his comments i think that gives you a really good band of where we think noninterest revenue could be in the coming quarters bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay appreciate that color and then wanted to go back you talked about the unsustainable ph quote level of asset quality and obviously things are really pristine i was curious if you had any comments i noticed theres a ph straight situation with the west texas gas natural gas situation where its actually trading at a negative level with some pipeline issues they have does that impact do you think energy in west texas for you at all scott bradley grauer a chief executive officerbok financial securities inc executive vice presidentwealth management bok financial corp no no i mean we certainly have our customers that have weve always had good hedge program with them and those temporary market moves do not really impact us at all brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay and then lastly for me i want to make sure i understood the commentary around youre expecting deposit levels to basically be kind of stable from here but it also sounds like youre expecting to do some securities purchases and fund loan growth does the balance sheet im just trying to understand the dynamic of the balance sheet and the margin from here you had balance sheet shrinkage in the third quarter but it sounds like youre you are expecting the balance sheet to grow from here is that a fair assessment steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp i think thats a fair assessment i want to go back to your deposit comment were not going to keep deposits level i mean i do think therell be some attrition of deposits in the fourth quarter maybe similar to what happened in the third so that part of the balance sheet will shrink well make that up through some wholesale borrowing source which we have tremendous liquidity there and so i think we can continue to grow loans i think theres an opportunity to grow ph they have this portfolio a little bit im not prepared to give guidance on that yet until we put our budget together but i do think were migrating towards that decision where we could add some afs mortgagebacked securities and gain some spread there so i would say yeah the balance sheet probably does grow with continued loan growth adding to afs to scotts point maybe there is an opportunity on the trading portfolio side to move that a little bit higher over time so well be able to fund that very effectively with other borrowing sources other than deposit growth brett rabatin q analyst hovde group llc okay it certainly seems like your balance sheet is better positioned than most in this environment so congrats on the quarter steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thank you stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 thank you operator our next question comes from jennifer demba with truist securities please proceed with your question jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc thank you good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp good morning jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc hey the asset quality looks terrific im wondering if youre seeing anything within the portfolio any negative migration trends in any segments that are worth noting i mean i think the only thing weve seen at all in the last quarter or two is maybe chargeoffs with some companies whove had supply chain issues just wondering what youre seeing in your portfolio stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp we really are seeing nothing systemic well have we had a oneoff here oneoff there in the third quarter but we still reduce our overall problem loans in the third quarter and the outlook for the fourth quarter isnt much different in terms of that migration so were going to well continue to monitor it we think our credit culture has been highly disciplined for quite some time so that as we go into one of a potential recession our customers are better situated to withstand it and not see material losses so were very comfortable with it right now but were certainly watching it to see if we see anything occur thats more systemic jennifer demba q analyst truist securities inc great thank you operator operator instructions one moment please while we pool for questions our next question come technical difficulty steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp whats his name stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp rob bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hey rob we got cut off there matt are you there matt olney i think he was reaching out to you for a question and we got cut off here from the operator operator ladies and gentlemen we apologize for the technical difficulty we do have an additional question coming from the line of matt olney with stephens please proceed with your question matthew olney q analyst stephens inc hey guys good morning steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp hey matt matthew olney q analyst stephens inc just want to circle back on a few topics and just to clarify the slide you have on the forecast and the assumptions steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp yeah matthew olney q analyst stephens inc when you mentioned the operating revenues should be in a range between and i think youre talking about on the fee side the commissions and fees am i interpreting that right steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp thats correct yes fees and commissions matthew olney q analyst stephens inc okay and i think that slide more or less says not just fourth quarter but kind of the next five quarters so fees and commissions in that range in the next five quarters is that right marc c maun a executive vice presidentregional banks bok financial corp yeah thats i mean thats a little harder to go out that far but certainly were comfortable with that second quarter result third quarter result somewhere in that range if you look at the composition of all of our fee businesses we feel like we can achieve somewhere in that neighborhood so thats what were trying to say there bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 matthew olney q analyst stephens inc okay well i appreciate that i get it its tough to forecast some of those lines and specifically one of those lines has been doing very strong more recently the syndication fees have been running pretty hot the last few quarters any change of strategy or any big driver of why thats been so strong over the last few quarters stacy c kymes a president chief executive officer director bok financial corp no i dont think its really a change of strategy its somewhat a maturing of the effort that weve undertaken for the last several years and its a top of mind effort across all our business lines and the increased focus has given us the opportunity to build that business and we expect to continue to do so its a very strong team and i think marcs right its how weve matured this business clearly our energy presence and our ability to lead larger deals and our how were viewed in the marketplace as an energy lender has helped us but really the growth there has been widespread matthew olney q analyst stephens inc okay thanks for that and then changing gears on the securities portfolio on the afs steven now last quarter you pointed towards those yields could be moving quite a bit higher and we definitely saw that in the third quarter it sounds like spreads remain favorable could we see even more improvement as we look to the towards the fourth quarter there steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp we could yes were getting million or so a month million to million of cash flow a month currently were reinvesting some of those dollars at so you could definitely see that portfolio yield migrate higher in the fourth quarter matthew olney q analyst stephens inc okay and then going back to the funding side i think what i heard you say was deposit balances were down in the third quarter but you think that could level out in the fourth quarter and so the incremental funding here i guess would be more on the wholesale brokerage side is that right steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial corp well i still believe deposits will move down into the deposit balances in the fourth quarter i just think that will happen of our deposits are on the commercial side the other are split pretty evenly between consumer and wealth and therell be with higher rates coming therell be more opportunity for some of those clients im sure to move to something off our balance sheet so well turn towards with balance sheet growth on both loan and the security side well turn towards other sources of funding which we have an abundance of that capacity as a company matthew olney q analyst stephens inc bok financial corp bokf corrected transcript q3 earnings call 26oct2022 yeah make sense to me okay thanks guys steven e nell a executive vice president chief financial officer director bok financial
