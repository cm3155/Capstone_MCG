23apr2024 christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you dominic turning to loans on slide let me comment on the trends in each of our major lending categories first demand for residential mortgage proved relatively durable despite seasonal slowdowns even with the generally elevated rate environment we continue to add residential mortgage loans in q1 and were pleased to see both our residential and home equity pipelines strengthening going into the second quarter second average ci balances grew driven in part by an uptick of utilization we saw at the end of the fourth quarter on a period end basis balances declined but that was really driven primarily by decreases in capital call line usage and drops in our hong kong portfolio based on our current pipeline we expect ci growth to pick up in q2 third average cre balances remain flat while period end cre balances were down for the quarter we continue to work with our longstanding relation clients but we are targeting only modest cre growth for slide summarizes trends in our securities portfolio during the first quarter we took steps to enhance our liquidity profile by putting our cash to work in highquality liquid assets we added short duration ginnie mae floaters at a rate of sofr much of which settled towards the end of the quarter with the purchase of these securities the book yield of our portfolio rose basis points to at quarter end our cash and securities portfolio rose to of total assets a level of on balance sheet liquidity we see as appropriate at our current size moving on to deposits on slide as dominic mentioned we grew deposits to record levels this quarter with average growth of or billion and nearly billion on a period end basis we saw growth in retail commercial and across all geographies this growth reflects the focus and dedication of our bankers and the loyalty and resilience of our broad base of customers base looking forward we continue to focus on adding granular consumer and business deposits during the quarter we also put up billion of floating rate federal home loan bank advances at a cost of sofr approximately basis points these advances have a laddered maturity schedule with billion maturing in the next months and the balance over slide covers our net interest income trends q1 dollar net interest income was million while our net interest margin was the margin compressed more than expected as we decided to extend and upsize our cd campaign time deposits accounted for much of the nim impact of basis points we expect further nim compression in q2 as deposit mix shift continues in this higher for longer environment nonetheless as we move through the year we expect an acceleration of asset growth will lead to more nim stability and a bottoming of the nim later in the second half of the year and now ill hand the call over to irene to talk about asset quality irene h oh executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc thank you chris and good afternoon to all on the call as you can see from slide the asset quality of our portfolio continues to broadly outperform the industry with credit beginning to normalize as dominic mentioned we recorded net chargeoffs of basis points in the first quarter or million quarteroverquarter non performing assets rose by basis points to basis points of total assets the increase in commercial real estate was driven by two credits one construction and one office property nonetheless the absolute levels remain relatively low the criticized loans ratio increased during the quarter to of loans the special mention loans ratio also increased basis points quarteroverquarter to of loans and the classified loans ratio increased basis points to we recorded a lower provision for credit losses of million in the first quarter compared with million for the fourth quarter given the resilient east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 economic environment and current cecl outlook we remain vigilant and proactive in managing our credit risks as we look forward we continue to expect quarterly net chargeoffs to be in the range of basis points to basis points turning to slide the total allowance for loan losses increased million quarteroverquarter primarily reflecting a million increase in our allowance for loan losses for commercial real estate loans specifically we increased the reserve for office by million bringing the coverage ratio to basis points for office loans we believe we are adequately reserved for the content of our loan portfolio given the current economic outlook turning to slide all of east west regulatory capital ratios remain well in excess of regulatory requirements for well capitalized institutions and well above regional and national bank averages east west common equity tier capital ratio stands at a robust while the tangible common equity ratio stayed relatively flat at these capital levels place us among the most well capitalized banks in the industry east west repurchased million shares of common stock during the first quarter for approximately million at just under a share we currently had million of repurchase authorization that remains available for future buybacks east west also redeemed million of trust preferred securities in the first quarter east west second quarter dividend will be payable on may to stockholders of record on may i will now turn the call back to chris to share our outlook for the full year chris christopher j del moralniles chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc thank you irene our full year outlook has shifted slightly let me highlight the changes we now assume a resilient first half with the economy beginning to soften later in the year we now expect rate cuts to begin in q3 we expect loan growth to pick up in the second quarter and for end of year loan growth to still be in the range of to buoyed by continued strength in our residential mortgage and a growing ci portfolio given fewer expected rate cuts were raising our net interest income guidance and now only expect a decline in the range of to up from our prior guidance with that i will now open the call for questions operator east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 question and answer section operator thank you we will now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions if you could please limit to one question and one followup question please rejoin the queue if you have any further questions the first question comes from jared shaw with barclays please go ahead jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc hi good afternoon everybody dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon jared jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc just looking at margin and nii i guess whats holding you back from being more up optimistic there youre seeing loan growth you have the securities the tailwind from securities is that just all being absorbed by higher expected deposit costs maybe just walk us through some of that would be great christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so for the record we are raising our nii guidance for the year and so i think we are a little more optimistic here as we move into the rest of the year that has been said yes we expect more deposit mix migration if we stay in a higher for longer environment and that seems to be what were sort of on pace for here for the second quarter so well give some of that up in the deposit mix and the cost of deposits and i would also remind you that late in march we refinanced the btfp and that had been at a very attractive level and we obviously replaced that largely with the cd campaign balances but those are of a higher cost so theres an inherent drag from that refinancing thats just baked in and the federal home loan bank advances are also at a slightly higher cost of course jared shaw q analyst barclays capital inc okay okay thanks for that and i guess as my followup just looking at capital even with the buyback and the redemption of the trust preferred were still seeing cet1 grow higher how should we be thinking about sort of upper limits of capital where you feel comfortable with the upper limits of capital and would the buyback be the primary way to limit or control that given the loan growth expectation christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc weve commented that we thought tce was a relevant measure for us to focus in on and were focused in on maintaining that and no longer warehousing additional capital and so well be proactive in all the actions east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 obviously we announced the dividend again today we still have some authorization and well continue to of course use our balance sheet to support our customers and grow our balance sheet to optimize capital operator the next question comes from casey haire with jefferies please go ahead casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah hi thanks good afternoon so i wanted to follow up on the margin so chris if im reading understanding you correctly you do expect more negative mix shift on the funding side i get the btfp and the borrowings but what about dda mix what does your guide assume in terms of how much more attrition there christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc look were still at even as we sit here today april 19th 20th so we feel comfortable that that number has come down reasonable and it will probably bottom somewhere in the mid area which we might be close to i think its a function of how we see the outlook shift as we move later into the quarter our expectation previously had been that when the fed started to lower rates we would see that deposit migration ease fed hasnt started to lower rates yet so that is continuing sort of month over month as we move through and its somewhat outlook dependent casey haire q analyst jefferies llc got you okay and then just switching to credit i guess irene for you you guys are sticking with your guidance on loss rates despite some decent migration trends weve seen that from other banks just wondering what gives you the confidence to keep the a rather benign loss guide given these migration trends irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question i think when we look at it and a granular level loan by loan loan review that were doing were very comfortable as far as the reserving that we are doing the grounds up kind of analysis of the portfolio and on the chargeoffs and our guidance i think quite honestly its in my mind kind of a wide range if you look at it quarterbyquarter but reflects kind of our views and our understanding of the portfolio today right operator the next question comes from dave rochester with compass point please go ahead david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc hey good afternoon guys just back on the capital should we just assume that you mentioned i think the tce ratio or cet1 ratio sort of flat lines from here since youre focused on those going forward and whatever you guys need to do in buybacks to sort of solve for that we should just expect to see some kind of a quarterly buyback going forward christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think were going to obviously use our balance sheet to support our customers and lending growth will still be the primary use of capital and that will continue to be the case to the extent lending growth perhaps is a little softer east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 maybe as it was in q1 we might add securities and that can also manage that number well continue to pay a strong dividend and buybacks is always sort of our last choice but one that we have the flexibility to opportunistically call upon when we see the right environment david rochester q analyst compass point research trading llc i appreciate that and then just as a followup whats the impact of a rate cut now on your nii i know youd mentioned something like million to million a month last quarter does that range still work and i know you mentioned bottoming and then bottoming in the second half of the year if you had to guess is that or and whats the timing of nii bottoming does that coincide with that or could that actually bottom a little bit sooner because of growth thanks christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc so yes i believe both the third and the fourth quarter in the second half and i believe itll bottom somewhere in the second half with regard to sort of nii we do think follow that same trend and also similarly on a dollar basis likely comes back stronger towards the end of the year and our actual nii sensitivity has increased in part because we added cumulatively over billion of floating rate securities and that just introduces a little more sensitivity and so its closer to million ph per cut as we look forward now operator your next question comes from ben gerlinger with citi please go ahead benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc hi good afternoon christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc good afternoon ben benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc i was curious it was obviously a big quarter on deposit growth largely due to the specialty brand i was curious are you seeing any other deposit trends just outside of that lunar new year special and anything we might see kind of extrapolating what youve seen now into or possibly the rest of the year christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think broadly speaking we are pleased to see commercial consumer and our overseas customers all contribute to the growth in the broad spectrum of deposits from a product side we saw growth in interest bearing checking money market and time deposits so essentially as long as there is some yield the customers are willing to reallocate the portfolio and see the balances obviously the downside to that is we saw shrinkage in the non interest bearing dda and i think thats the fundamental migration that were all zeroed in on and trying to make sure we understand how that continues to evolve in this higher for longer context east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 benjamin gerlinger q analyst citigroup global markets inc got you thats helpful and ph then i know on the guidance this question is a bit nuanced so it says picking up loan growth in q2 and i hate to ask but is it fair to think that average balance sheet is pretty minimal and its more kind of a late june or do you think it ramps throughout the entire quarter christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we see evidence of positive trends in our pipelines and so we think well see positive trends pick up here in q2 operator your next question comes from manan gosalia with morgan stanley please go ahead manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc can you talk about the drivers for loan growth from here and i know youd note that it should pick up in and then in your broader macro outlook you called out a resilient first half with a softening economy in the second half can you talk about why youre expecting the economy to soften in the second half and if it doesnt is there some upside to those loan growth numbers christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure so i think were following our cues from the fed and the fed has said that theyre proactively planning to engineer a softer landing and so that seems to be baked into the forward curve and given that context thats the environment that were assuming the reason were confident well see the loan growth pick up is really driven by our own interactions with our customers and the pipelines that we see so we expect to see ci growth happens because we have term sheets and conversations that would lead us to expect that those are going to close we expect to see residential come through because we know those loans are in the pipeline theyre already there and theyre just in the process of moving through to close and so well see residential growth well see ci growth and again were not focused on cre growth but we may see some of that too manan gosalia q analyst morgan stanley co llc got it and maybe a followup on the question on criticized assets i know its similar to what weve seen at peers but i guess one point of difference is that you did also have the criticized assets in the cre book rise which we havent seen at many peers so i was wondering if you can just shed some light over all was this a deep dive east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 that you did how comfortable are you with those credits and why not move the loan loss reserve up a little bit given this higher level of criticized assets irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc yeah great question so with the criticized assets movement for commercial real estate i would say its pretty broad based there is isnt one sector industry or geography that we are more concerned about and maybe more importantly we do not believe we have concentrations of risk areas were very concerned with on the calculation and the allowance calculation as you know there are some confines as far as cecl model and weve disclosed this in the past as far as the fact that for cecl for us we use a multiscenario approach so i think that gives me comfort as far as its a little bit more heavily weighted to a downside scenario with that said i think with things that are feasible for us with the qualitative and the quantitative reserve thats something on the qualitative side we want to make sure that we continue to add if appropriate and thats what youve seen a little bit happen in this quarter operator the next question comes from brandon king with truist please go ahead brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey good afternoon i noticed there was a healthy pickup in loan yields in the quarter so i was wondering if thats a reasonable pace to expect over the next few quarters and if theres anything to call out there christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc no i think obviously our residential mortgages are coming on at a higher rate than the portfolio and thats additive broadly speaking our commercial yields and the new loan volume pricing is roughly in line with where its been and theres not a material uptick brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then on the cd for cds when you look at your repricing and maturity schedule at what point are cds rolling over to maybe a stable rate and maybe when or if that kind of turns into a tailwind maybe in the back half of this year christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah so well see billion to billion of cds roll over each quarter over the next couple of quarters obviously we just put on the billion of the lunar cd special and that will come off in the third quarter so the third quarter is the heavy quarter and thats were anticipating that there might be some rate movements that happened in the third quarter and that will play into that operator the next question comes from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 hey good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just a followup on credit like on slide i think where you disclosed of cre customers have interest derivative contract i guess hedging them against higher rates just talk to us in terms of the deep dive of the portfolio reviews that youve done if we are in a higher for longer over the next two years how much risk within that cre book increases as these derivative contracts im assuming at some point roll off and just how you assess that in terms of the potential risk exposure tied to the book thank you christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure eb so the good news is most of our customers put on swaps to the maturity of their loan and so there really isnt a significant inter maturity rate rollover risk on the vast majority of them so that risk for us is highly contained and thats by design and the way we market the solution to our customers we have been steadily growing the fixed rate portfolio the other side of that chart and the combination means that as we think about the future were locking in more and more fixed rate as we move towards the expectation that there might be a downdraft in rates in the future and the swaps that we put on to hedge our balance sheet have all been received fixed forwards and so to the extent that in were staring at inherently a lower rate environment and today we think that combination of factors will all play into our benefit our customers who have locked in will be perfectly fine continue to be perfectly fine through maturity and our balance sheet we will be more fixed and receiving more fixed and what we expect to be a declining rate outlook which we think is to our benefit and our shareholders benefit ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and this gives us a perspective chris in terms of when these loans are coming up for maturity whats happening are they ph reifying into another sort of fixed rate loan on this balance sheet or how many of these are moving out getting ph reified by insurance companies et cetera christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc i think we see the gamut of activity the good news is theres a high history here of relatively low ltv lending and so theres plenty of equity for these guys to always find another outlet if not with backed with us operator your next question comes from chris mcgratty with kbw please go ahead christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 great thanks chris going back to the comments on the hqla you referenced the youre about where you need to be if you kind of zoom out is that the comment more about the size of the balance sheet today or kind of you think where you need to be for when you cross christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc no im going to only comment on where we are for the current institution keep in mind were only its a pretty long way from christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc no i got it okay but in terms of i guess asking the capital question a little bit differently you commented about buybacks but should we be thinking about perhaps more liquidity but at a lower nim producing higher nii its kind of a dynamic of what youre doing to the balance sheet right now christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc probably the implication of what we did in the first quarter for sure and that will play itself out but were optimistic that well see loan growth pick up in the second quarter and continue to drive towards the loan guidance that weve laid out and we think that will contribute to again helping the nim bounce back later in the year while still growing nii operator operator instructions your next question comes from samuel varga with ubs please go ahead samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc good afternoon dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc good afternoon samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc i just want to follow up on the loan growth funding question i guess understanding the sort of backdrop of the hqla build how much of a willingness do you have to actually use some of the cash to fund the loan growth christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc sure so the investment portfolio will throw off million per quarter of net proceeds and so we think that is part of how we could fund some of the growth as we look forward samuel varga q analyst ubs securities llc east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 okay thank you and then in terms of just the tradeoff between putting on the cds at very competitive rates versus fhlb is that going to be a simple always cd preference or how do you think about that sort of funding mix christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc yeah look i think we obviously know the fhlb is there for us we clearly would rather pay at the margin our customers a better rate than borrow from a wholesale institution and we think that is both a better economic outcome and a better outcome for the franchise and the value that we create for our customers so there is a preference there but i think well look to optimize our cost of funding in the ordinary course and do incrementally the right thing as we move forward irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc maybe just ill add one thing the ph fhlb we put on is the variable rate so thats also was a part of the analysis for us operator your next question is a followup question from ebrahim poonawala with bank of america please go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good afternoon again christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc eb you cut out dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah we cannot hear you ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hi can you hear me now christopher j del moralniles a chief financial officer executive vice president east west bancorp inc we can hear you now go ahead ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah just wanted to understand given east west capital positioning the market disruption just talk to us in terms of investment and banker hiring like how fertile is it to attract talent and maybe move market share in a world where overall growth may be slow thank you east west bancorp inc ewbc corrected transcript q1 earnings call 23apr2024 dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc the question on investment in talent ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc yeah i think that we will were always on the lookout in fact for new talent to join the organization and frankly with what happened months ago there is a lot of disruption in the market and so we do feel that there are plenty of talents out there in the market that are possibly looking for new homes but weve been very very selective because its not every banker that fit into the east west bank culture its not every banker that actually like to do the things that we do and oftentimes if you look at it is that there are a lot of banks out there that have bankers that habitually do much bigger loans and that doesnt fit into our diversification strategy and so we are going to continue to be very selective and choosy in terms of making sure we find the right fit and when we do find the right fit we are absolutely well be delighted to welcome them to be part of the east west bank family and this is something that were not going to be rushing to it and i do notice that there are other banks who may be all looking into getting a big group of talent from specific bank that are having some turmoil we dont necessarily feel that that is going to be actually an attractive strategy for east west bank we have been able to grow organically pretty nicely for the last almost years now that we have not made an acquisition since january of and even that was a very small acquisition so most of our growth for the last years and its been through organic direction so we like that approach and we think that bringing the right talent understanding the east west specific value proposition and understand that the importance of a balance between risk management and also growth and those are the people that fit into us well and then we will continue to identify these type of talents and bring them on ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc thats great color thanks dominic thanks again bye dominic ng a chairman chief executive officer east west bancorp inc thank you irene h oh a executive vice president chief risk officer east west bancorp inc thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn conference back for closing remarks east west bancorp inc ewbc
