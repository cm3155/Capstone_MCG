j squeri chairman chief executive officer american express co thanks vivian good morning and thank you for joining us today i hope you and your families are all healthy and safe as you saw this morning we announced third quarter earnings of per share on billion in revenues while our results continue to be significantly affected by the impacts of the pandemic were increasingly confident that our strategy for managing through the current environment is the right one overall i feel very good about the progress we made in the quarter in a number of key areas weve seen a steady recovery in our overall spending volumes since the lows of midapril in fact nonte spending in the quarter which has long accounted for the large majority of our volumes was up slightly year over year online consumer retail spending was particularly strong up over last year and within our commercial business ap automation volumes continued their rapid growth although from a small base doubling since last years third quarter as more businesses adopt digital payment solutions our credit metrics continue to be excellent with delinquencies and net writeoffs at the lowest levels weve seen in a few years nevertheless we continue to be cautious about the direction of the pandemic impacts on the economy and this is reflected in our reserve levels which jeff will cover in more detail voluntary attrition rates on american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 our proprietary products remain lower than last year demonstrating that our customers continue to see value in our products and services we continue to invest in our business by launching our largest ever shop small initiative supporting small merchants in markets around the world also the enhancements we made to the value propositions on many of our card products have produced strong results both in terms of increased spending and customer retention in addition weve begun to selectively increase customer acquisition activities across our businesses let me quickly review our four key priorities for which ill remind you include supporting our colleagues and winning as a team protecting our customers and the brand structuring the company for growth and remaining financially strong this last priority remaining financially strong is critically important in any environment and especially in these uncertain times as it establishes the foundation for executing against our strategic imperatives across our businesses im pleased to say that weve maintained a strong liquidity position our capital ratios are well above our targets and weve continued to pay our dividend each quarter in terms of our first priority supporting our colleagues and winning as a team from the beginning our goal has been to take care of our colleagues so that they could continue to take care of our customers as conditions begin to improve in a number of countries since moving virtually all of our colleagues to workfromhome arrangements in march we have begun the phased reopening of our offices in of our locations including our headquarters in new york with a range of new safety procedures to ensure the health and wellbeing of our colleagues and we are giving our colleagues the flexibility to continue working from home through june of should they choose to do so were really proud of the resiliency and dedication our colleagues have demonstrated through this period which has helped to drive our progress on our next priority protecting our customers and the brand throughout this period thanks to the efforts of our frontline staff our customer satisfaction levels have remained strong and have actually improved globally on a yearoveryear basis our customers have recognized our commitment to service excellence ranking us number one in the jd power us credit card satisfaction study the 10th time weve achieved the top spot in addition to the expansion of our shop small program and the enhancements to our value propositions a key differentiator for us has been the timely rollout of shortterm and enhanced longerterm relief programs for customers who have experienced financial challenges during the pandemic were no longer seeing new inflows into our shortterm programs in the us and weve expanded our longerterm programs to countries around the world our last priority is structuring the company for growth we continue to selectively invest for the long term youve seen this in the announcements such as our recent acquisition of kabbage a leading financial technology company serving small businesses in the us and in the official launch of our network in mainland china where in addition to signing merchants and cementing relationships with key digital partners wechat and alipay were currently working to develop debit capabilities on our network to capture some of the significant debit usage within china let me step back for a moment and tell you how were thinking about our financial decisions moving forward weve been looking at our strategy for managing through this cycle through the lens of three phases the first phase has been about navigating through the peak of the crisis and weve been focused on this phase the past few quarters the second phase which were now in the early stages of is about rebuilding our growth american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 momentum by increasing investments in key strategic areas our goal in doing this is to enable us to enter the third phase generating precovid levels of earnings and returning to our financial growth algorithm while we hope that the worst is behind us we do not know for certain that thats the case we recognize that there remains a high degree of uncertainty in the environment and thats why well continue our strategy of focusing on the four priorities i just discussed whats different is that now as were beginning to see improvements in our business well be placing even a greater emphasis on accelerating investments in core strategic areas in order to build momentum and position the company for longterm growth as economic conditions improve key areas of investment will include accelerating customer acquisition activities across our businesses continuing to refresh value propositions on our card products including new broader lifestyle benefits and additional businesscentric offerings developing additional solutions beyond the card to expand our relationships with small businesses maintaining virtual parity coverage in the us and expanding merchant coverage in key international markets while strengthening and broadening critical partnerships and enhancing our digital capabilities across our business the pace of our investment acceleration will be driven by the economic environment which as you know is highly dependent on the course the pandemic takes and the availability of additional government stimulus in the us and key international regions in addition while we plan to ramp up investments well maintain our flexibility by controlling operating expenses and pulling back on investments if conditions deteriorate significantly now i cant tell you when phase will begin but were confident that the groundwork we will lay in phase will provide us with the foundation we need to generate momentum to gain share scale and relevance as we exit the recovery phase and return to precovid levels of earnings and our financial growth algorithm before i hand the call over to jeff i want to take a moment to share my personal thoughts on the current environment over the past few months ive spent a lot of time talking with other key leaders across industries but particularly with our partners our customers and our board i would say that while im personally less optimistic in the near term i am more optimistic about the longerterm prospects for our economy and for american express near term there continues to be a high degree of uncertainty about the direction of the virus and its impact on the economy developments in the political environment the availability of future stimulus packages and how local governments will react to changes in local conditions however i believe were well positioned to continue operating successfully through this period by being prepared for the unexpected maintaining financial flexibility and quickly adjusting our strategies as necessary looking at the longer term i am more optimistic i believe there is pentup demand among consumers to travel again once they feel safe to do so after many months sheltering at home at the same time i believe the increases we see in online spending and the creative pivoting of business models in the small business community will continue and i believe we are poised to take advantage of the opportunities these trends present i also believe that this crisis has made us even more resilient and agile and flexible as a company which will continue beyond this crisis and make us even stronger over the longer term having said that no one knows what the future will bring but regardless well continue to do what were best at focusing on what we can control such as taking care of our colleagues and serving our customers putting the right building blocks in place and creating momentum to drive future growth american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 thank you and let me now hand it over to jeff who will walk you through our financial results jeffrey c campbell chief financial officer american express co thanks steve and good morning everyone as i have the last two quarters im going to talk you through a different somewhat more detailed set of slides from what weve used historically in order to help you understand how our business is performing in this unprecedented environment the key drivers of our financial performance in this environment remain volume and credit trends along with this quarter the early days of some spending on what steve just called phase our efforts to rebuild growth momentum so ill spend most of my time in these areas lets get right into our summary financials on slide as you can see our results this quarter are better than q2 as spending rose sequentially our credit provision was much lower and we used these improved results to begin to fund more efforts to rebuild growth momentum that said our results obviously continue to be significantly impacted by the global pandemic and the resulting containment measures that governments are taking around the world third quarter revenues of billion were down year over year on an fxadjusted basis driven by declines in spendlend and other travelrelated revenues while card fee revenues continued to grow net income was billion and earnings per share was in the third quarter down from a year ago to get into the details of our performance lets start with volumes as we have all year well continue to show you our billed business performance with a bit more granularity on monthly trends looking at the first few weeks of october i would point out that we have not seen any material changes thus far in october compared to the monthly and quarterly data for q3 that well focus on this morning slide shows that after hitting a low in the second quarter overall billed business declines have improved sequentially to down year over year in q3 on an fxadjusted basis our proprietary business which makes up of our total billings drives most of our financial results was down the same the remaining of our overall billings which comes from our network business gns was down in the third quarter now when you look at our proprietary billed business today you really have to talk about te spending and non te spending separately given the very different impacts the pandemic has had on these volume trends as you can see on slide nonte spending which has long been the majority of our volumes has recovered to pre covid levels and actually grew year over year in the quarter te spending remained down much more significantly though it did show some continued modest sequential improvements throughout the third quarter driven primarily by consumers these very different trends in nonte versus te drive much of the difference in volume performance by segment and by customer type that you see on slide in the consumer segment for example us consumer spending has recovered faster than international consumer due to the higher mix of nonte spending in our us volumes in the commercial segment spending from small and mediumsize enterprise customers which historically has the highest mix of nonte spending has been the most resilient so far whereas large and global corporate card spending which historically has been primarily te has been down the most during the pandemic id also remind here that spending from our sme customers represents the majority of our commercial billed business american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 we drill down further into all these points as you turn to slide which points out that while historically nonte spending was of our proprietary billed business today nonte categories represent of our proprietary billed business this mix shift has occurred across all customer types as you see at the bottom of the slide so whats driving this beyond the obvious decline in te spend well as you would expect we have continued to see an increasing shift to online and card not present spending in the current environment the shift is most evident in the consumer business whereas commercial spending in the nonte categories has been predominantly online for quite some time as you can see on slide you see more about these shifts on slide with consumer online spend continuing to grow in the double digits at an accelerated pace relative to precovid levels up year over year in the third quarter even as offline spend has gradually recovered from the april low in our commercial segment in contrast since most of the spend was online even prepandemic the online and offline trends are more similar you see other drivers of the growth in nonte spending as you look at the categories of nonte spend by segment on slide for consumers you see the growth in nonte spending is driven by strong growth in online retail spending in line with the growth we just spoke about for commercial since the bulk of spending was already online the most significant area of growth is in advertising media and communications particularly from small and mediumsize enterprises as they evolve their marketing and customer engagement strategies in the current more digital environment so overall we see the consumers and smes in particular have adapted their behaviors to the challenges of the current environment which is why nonte spending has recovered to pre covid levels and is starting to show some growth now coming back to te on slide as a reminder the majority of our te spending has historically come from our consumer business and that is even more true today and consumer te spending has continued to see a much faster recovery as shown on slide followed by small and mediumsize enterprises and then large corporations we expect this trend to continue given the pentup demand to travel that we see in our consumer base and our expectation that corporations particularly large ones will continue to limit their te spending for some time you also see the different pace of recovery within the categories of te cruises which are a very small part of our business have been slower to recover followed by the airlines restaurant spending on the other hand has been the most resilient throughout in between you see lodging and other te where you continue to see spending volumes modestly recover but at varying paces for example spending on home rentals and at resorts servicing domestic leisure travelers have been performing better than spending at hotels in urban locations you see the impact of different mixes of te spend when you look at our international regions on slide which have more travelrelated spending historically and thus are showing larger overall declines in volume us spending volumes continued to steadily recover throughout the third quarter on the other hand the volume recovery in europe and asia has moderated a bit somewhat in line with some additional restrictions in key markets for amex such as the uk parts of the eu japan and australia and finally as we look at spending in the us across our six largest states from a volume standpoint on slide i would say that the trends across states have been perhaps surprisingly similar given the variance in medical trends and government policies so moving next now to loans and receivables on slide loans declined by year over year in the third quarter primarily driven by lower spending volumes as you heard from many other institutions we also saw higher paydown rates in the third quarter which drove a small sequential decline in loan volumes despite the improvement in spend versus q2 american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 based on what we see today if you assume some continued improvement in spending levels i would expect this quarter to be the low point for loan balances and looking forward for those balances to start to grow modestly sequentially beginning in q4 mostly driven in the beginning by transactor volumes rebounding card member receivables on the other hand were up sequentially in the third quarter relative to the second quarter driven by the improvement in spending volumes i just spoke about so lets go now to our traditional credit metrics which you see on slide and you see the credit trends in the third quarter were solid and remained bestinclass card member loans and receivable writeoff dollars excluding gcp were actually down and year over year respectively in the third quarter you do see an increase in writeoff rates year over year but this is primarily due to the significantly lower loan and receivable balances as opposed to there being any significant change yet in these traditional credit metrics though we would expect to see some impact on these metrics in future quarters in addition our delinquency dollars and rates continued to be down year over year and sequentially in the third quarter and in fact our third quarter delinquency rates are the lowest weve seen in several years which is certainly unusual given the economic environment we feel good about our credit performance our risk management capabilities and the work weve done to manage our exposure so far it all starts with the changes weve made over the last few years in our risk management practices which gave us a solid starting position as well as the way we mobilized our organization to ensure that we had the appropriate programs and people in place to support our card members who needed financial assistance of course like others our customers are also helped by external factors such as the impact of record levels of government stimulus and the broad availability of forbearance programs as a result we do remain cautious about the potential for future shocks to the economy and that caution is reflected in the macroeconomic outlook that informs our credit reserves moving on to slide you will see that our provision expense for the third quarter is significantly lower sequentially and also declined year over year simply reflecting our strong credit performance as well as a modest adjustment to our reserves as we think about the range of economic outcomes that are used in our modeling of cecl reserves for the expected lifetime loss of the receivables and loans on our balance sheet you will see on slide that the range of macroeconomic assumptions we have used in our calculations are more divergent for the third quarter relative to q2 the baseline scenario has improved a bit from the prior quarter but the downside scenario is more pessimistic and we have weighted it more than we did in q2 given the continued high level of uncertainty in the economy and the pace of recovery the impact of this more cautious set of macroeconomic assumptions on our reserve models was offset by our favorable credit metrics and also a modest sequential decline in loan volumes this quarter resulting overall in there being very little change to our reserve levels as you can see on slide we ended the third quarter with billion of reserves representing of our loan balances and of our card member receivable balances respectively in line with q2 and up billion from their prepandemic levels so how do we feel about this level of reserves in todays environment we believe that the reserves on our balance sheet are appropriate given the broad range of economic outcomes envisioned in our baseline and downside scenarios and looking at the balances that are in delinquent status or in one of our financial relief programs on slide those balances continued to decline sequentially to billion at the end of q3 and now stand billion higher than they were prepandemic american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 as weve wound down the shortterm customer pandemic relief program that we put in place at the height of the crisis in march weve continued to see that the majority of the balances that have exited the program have remained current the increase in our longerterm financial relief program balances over the past two quarters reflects the effectiveness of the work we have done to help card members that need financial assistance in rolling the right longerterm program for them historically the credit outcomes of card members that enroll in these programs are better than those that do not with around of enrolled balances successfully completing these programs and the repayment trends of the card members currently enrolled in frp have been in line with our historical experience only time will tell what the ultimate level of writeoffs will be given the completely unprecedented nature of the global environment but we feel good about our risk management practices the way we are managing our exposure to the current environment and the resulting level of reserves we are holding moving on to revenues on slide revenues were down year over year in the third quarter given the spendcentric nature of our business model revenue declines have improved sequentially in line with volumes since the lows of midapril turning to our largest component of revenue discount revenue i would move you ahead to slide as expected the contraction in discount revenue was larger than the decline in billed business due to the difference in te and nonte billings trends this drove a basis point decline in the average discount rate in the third quarter relative to the prior year since we on average earn higher discount rates with te merchants versus nonte merchants looking forward if te spending continues to modestly recover we would expect to see slightly less yearoveryear discount rate erosion in the fourth quarter turning next to slide net card fee growth has been strong throughout this year and grew this quarter demonstrating the impact of the continued strong card member engagement that steve discussed but growth has been decelerating steadily because of our decision to pull back on new card acquisitions as we were managing through the peak of uncertainty during the crisis i do expect some continued deceleration in growth rates though i would still expect doubledigit net card fee growth in the fourth quarter moving on to the details of net interest income and yield on slide on the lefthand side you see that net interest income declined on an fxadjusted basis which was slightly less than the loan declines we saw in the third quarter due to the yearoveryear expansion in yield that you see on the righthand side of the page net interest yield on our card member loans increased basis points year over year in the third quarter driven by modest tailwinds from lower funding cost mix and effectively pricing for risk looking forward into the fourth quarter and assuming we continue to see higher paydown rates from revolving card members id expect net interest income to be relatively flat sequentially moving on to slide were continuing to break out our expenses between variable customer engagement expenses which come down naturally as spend declines and benefits and its uses changes and marketing and opex which are driven by management decisions variable customer engagement expenses in total were down year over year driven by lower spend and lower usage of travelrelated benefits the yearoveryear decline in variable customer engagement expenses provided a offset to the revenue decline in the third quarter in the fourth quarter id expect to see somewhat less of an offset if the recent modest uptick in te rewards redemptions and usage of travelrelated benefits continues american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 we are clearly seeing evidence of pentup demand for travel in our membership rewards base as card members are banking points to use on future travel as opposed to redeeming them on one of our many non travelrelated redemption alternatives in contrast to the declines in variable customer engagement expenses marketing expenses were up year over year this aligns with steves earlier point that we have entered the second phase of our strategy for managing through this cycle which is about rebuilding growth momentum the increase was driven by the enhancements we have made to our value propositions and by the approximately million we spent on our largest ever shop small campaign based on the current economic environment i would expect our marketing expense in the fourth quarter to be at levels similar to the third quarter finally operating expenses were down year over year in the third quarter as we executed on our cost reduction plans looking ahead we have begun to selectively spend in areas critical to rebuilding growth momentum as we enter phase as a result we expect our q2 through q4 yearoveryear opex declines will be somewhat less than the billion we initially discussed back in april which in hindsight was at the moment a peak uncertainty about the future moving last to capital and liquidity on slide our capital and liquidity positions remain tremendously strong as they have all year our cet1 ratio increased to our highest level since we began reporting this ratio reflecting the retention of capital generated by stronger earnings this quarter our cash and investment balance remained at a near record high of billion in the third quarter we obviously remain confident in the significant flexibility we have to maintain a strong balance sheet and liquidity in periods of heightened stress and uncertainty looking forward we are committed to our dividend distribution and to our longterm cet1 target ratio of to as the economic situation becomes clearer and as the fed allows banks to resume share repurchases in summary though the external environment remains uncertain in the near term we are confident in how we are managing the company for the long term the investments we are making in phase will provide us with the foundation we need to rebuild growth momentum to gain share scale and relevance as we exit the recovery phase and return to precovid levels of earnings in our financial growth algorithm in phase and with that ill turn the call back over to vivian vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations american express co thank you jeff before we open up the lines for qa i will ask those in the queue to please limit yourself to just one question thank you for your cooperation with that the operator will now open up the line for questions operator american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 question and answer section operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of don fandetti with wells fargo please go ahead donald fandetti q analyst wells fargo securities llc good morning so jeff october you said hasnt changed much but if you look at september i mean in the us most of the states are sort of ramping up in terms of their year over year has that rampup continued or has that stalled jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co yeah good question we chose not to add the first half of october this time because the trends all continue so what that means is you do continue to see modest but steady improvement in the us and you do continue to see a little bit more caution in europe and markets like australia and japan so i think if you look at those july august september trends it gives you a pretty good sense of what were seeing right up through today operator next we will go to the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley please go ahead betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hi betsy betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi thanks for the time this morning question on the entry into phase in the marketing i heard youre moving into the phase here wanted to understand what you saw in your customer set that said this is the right time to do this now and how that feeds into not only the marketing piece but the other investments youre making should we take from that that yearonyear is now going to be more normal than down and then the other piece of that question is if this more negative scenario that you outlined very cleanly and clearly in your deck on the negative environment if that were to happen do you flex back to the phase environment thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co so ill take that betsy and let me provide a little bit of context overall on how we think about this when i first took over i was asked a question how i would navigate in a credit situation nobody ever asked me the question how id navigate in a pandemic but i was asked that question i was also asked that question when we had our american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 investor call this year and what i said was we would invest for the long term through a crisis and thats what were doing so why start now and look we entered phase basically towards the latter stages of the third quarter as far as im concerned what we saw is exactly what jeff just talked to don about we saw a steady improvement in billings we have a real understanding of whats going on from a credit perspective and for us it makes sense to invest in the business and lets look at sort of how i think and how the executive team thinks about this when we look at this particular quarter if you dive into these numbers what you will see is that our marketing expenditure in this quarter was up year over year not sequentially but year over year and i dont know how many people had that either in their calculus or sort of in their models but during times like this probably the goto move is to reduce marketing but we dont believe that thats true what we believe in a situation like this is the most important thing that we can do is solidify our foundation and our foundation is built on two things it is built on our card members and merchants and our brand and what you saw us do in the third quarter from a merchant perspective and a brand perspective we invested million in countries over weeks in the largest small business campaign that weve ever done in the history of the company and that has given us with our constituents in small business a lot of positive impact it has helped the brand it resonates on who we are from a card member perspective we continue to make value injections and the reality is what has happened is that you see attrition levels lower than last year and a lot of our card members are feepaying card members and they are sticking with us because number one we continue to invest in the relationship number two we continue to provide the best service in the industry so it was very important for us to solidify that foundation and i said thats what we would do and that is exactly what we are doing the second point i would make and this gets to investing for growth was once you solidify that foundation how do you build on that foundation and we did three very specific things in the quarter the three things that we did were number one we stepped up card acquisition sequentially quarter over quarter we have increase in cards acquired we acquired million card members in the quarter versus million thats down from last year but were selectively doing it because what we are doing is we have more line of sight right now into behaviors we have more line of sight into the potential customers that we can acquire we went out and we acquired kabbage kabbage is going to accelerate our efforts in small business from a platform perspective by anywhere from to months from what we would invest in ourselves and kabbage will help us create really an sme digital banking platform which is allinclusive and so we feel good about that and we launched our network in china and we certainly feel good about that and we continue to invest in coverage so as i sit here it would have been pretty easy for me to say to the team lets reduce marketing by lets do this and so forth and if you look at sort of the numbers that we reported between our increase in marketing and the lack of a reduction thats like a eps swing so if i were to reduce marketing by as opposed to increase marketing by wed be sitting here potentially talking about eps but the reality is in this environment eps is short term short lived and not what were focused on as a company what we are focused on as a company is continuing to build this brand and to build this franchise for the long term and the investments that we are making will play out for years to come american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 to your question about will we pull back and what do we need to see about pulling back well continue to watch the credit markets we will continue to see how our card members behave well continue to see how governments open up so for example if everything was closed it made no sense to do that small business promotion we had decided to do that small business promotion really in early may at the right time and we waited till the end of june to launch it in the united states because states werent opening so we will pull back on marketing from both an acquisition perspective and a support perspective if we see closures or if we dont have the line of sight insight and the nice part about that is we have the flexibility to do that and were not committed but what we are committed to doing is to continue to invest in this franchise for the longer term operator next we will go to the line of david togut with evercore isi stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co i think we lost him operator one moment here let me see if i can get him back jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co we got the first half a word stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah operator david can you press again lets try opening that again david are you there david mark togut q analyst evercore group llc yes i am can you hear me now operator okay yes stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yes great david mark togut q analyst evercore group llc thanks so much steve you called out maintaining virtual parity coverage in the us with visa and mastercard and you articulated some initiatives there im wondering if you could talk a bit more about your thoughts around the mdr and how that could evolve going forward american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 and then international expansion you also highlighted youve pulled back in europe and australia with gns being effectively shut down how are you thinking about expanding in some of these international areas in this environment is it more with the proprietary card going forward stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co let me just answer the second question first and ill come back to the first one but look i think in europe and in australia the way sort of regulations work our economic model doesnt really work in a gns environment and so to remind people we do have a premium discount rate within europe and within australia and within europe if in fact we had gone to a fourparty model which we had we had a fourparty model and we had a threeparty model it would have regulated our interchange and therefore reduced our margins significantly so were effectively out of gns as it relates to europe and as it relates to australia but if you look at our business the two fastestgrowing pieces of our business prepandemic was our international sme business and our international consumer business and the advantage that we do have is we are able to really target card members who were looking for tremendous value within the products and so you see a preponderance of feebased products in international with a lot of value from a card member and driving significant spend into those markets so we continue to invest in europe in card acquisition but more importantly right now were investing in merchant coverage and what weve done is weve looked at sort of our international markets and weve talked about strategic markets and sort of the top markets that we invest in but we also look at the cities where our card members live and where they travel to now obviously card members are not traveling anywhere right now but we do look at the top cities across the world and we have focused our coverage efforts really to get a lot more targeted coverage and weve had lots of success and we will continue to do that and were using the same kinds of tools that we did in the united states whether its well we cant use an optblue program in europe per se were using our onepoint isis telemarketing and so forth and we see significant coverage increases in those markets in international so we are still committed were still investing and once we get through this pandemic there will continue to be some of the fastestgrowing pieces of our business as far as the us and lets just talk about the discount rate for a second we saw actually a sequential increase in the discount rate this quarter obviously a decrease year over year and that is really due to mix and so when you look at mix with te being down year over year and those industries having the higher mdr thats whats really driving it maintaining virtual parity coverage we are there any discount rate erosion that was either contemplated or done has been done as it relates to optblue and virtual parity coverage so were beyond that i think what youre seeing now in the discount rate erosion is really due to mix of business and what our expectations are is when we get back to a normal environment whenever that may be you will see a normal mix because we believe and look i dont know about you but im going a little bit crazy just sort of staying in my house and not traveling and not being on the road seeing customers and partners and colleagues or taking vacations with my family and so there is a pentup demand certainly for consumer travel and youre seeing a little bit more of that very very small right now but there is going to be a big pentup demand and well be there and ready to serve that demand when it comes to fruition operator next well go to the line of bill carcache with wolfe research american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 bill carcache q analyst wolfe research thank you good morning steve and jeff if we look ahead months from now hopefully were in an environment where travel and spending have more fully normalized but retaining existing customers until we get to that point seems like a critical element of your strategy can you frame for us how you think about the dynamics around the cost of retaining an existing customer today versus the cost of losing that customer and having to reacquire them later stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co i think the dynamic is very simple it has traditionally and over time and will always be a lot cheaper to retain a customer than it is to acquire a new customer and so it is an investment that we are making and will continue to make i mean just think about what it takes to sort of mine to go get new customers and then to bring them along from a spending perspective we have sort of worked with our customers here to target their spending and what were seeing is obviously some of our customers are spending in areas now that they hadnt spent before and if you look at sort of some of the things that weve done with streaming credits and even with wireless credits and even shipping credits we have actually engaged our card members to spend in areas that they hadnt spent in before and its always amazing to me the dynamic of how people compartmentalize their spending and you would just think that everybody who is using the product would use it consistently across these things but some of these programs that weve had to retain customers have actually helped to open up new categories where theyre spending with us and so what happens here is as we open up those new categories that will continue and be consistent over time as they then get back to their travel spending so i think some of the investment and some of the spending that were seeing now is going to benefit us going forward so bottom line much much cheaper and i cant give you the exact numbers the rois and so forth but much cheaper to retain an existing customer than it is to mine for a new one jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co and steve i might just also point back to your earlier comments about our attrition rates being down versus pre pandemic the foundation of our business are very longterm customer relationships and when you look at our best customers the attrition rates are remarkably low customers stay with us for a very long time and so thats what we build the company on bill and thats what were focused on maintaining through the pandemic operator next well go to the line of rick shane with jpmorgan please go ahead richard shane q analyst jpmorgan securities llc thanks for taking my questions and really appreciate additional disclosure its very helpful in understanding a lot of these trends jeff looking at slide i am curious if the financial relief programs that youre offering are disproportionately being offered to the sme borrowers and if thats an area that we should be watching in terms of emerging credit american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co so thats actually a really good question rick and since you flipped to page ill encourage everyone to flip because the really interesting thing is that if you go back to april so the peak moment really in hindsight of uncertainty in april there were a disproportionate number of our sme customers who signed up for our very short term so one month as youll recall customer pandemic relief program the really interesting thing though as the months have gone by is when you go to today and to the numbers on the far right of page in fact the sme customers are no longer a disproportionate share and so it appears to us that the small and midsize enterprise customers i think prudently said well heck not sure what the future holds if this programs out there im going to sign up for it back in april but most of them have pulled out of it have not signed up in disproportionate numbers for the frp programs and so we feel good about small business and in fact i think its probably worth reminding everyone that our small business card members are predominantly people like contractors and architects and lawyers who for the most part are thriving in the current environment and only a very small percentage of our small business card members are in some of the hardest hit sectors like restaurants or online retail or excuse me offline retail operator next well go to the line of bob napoli with william blair robert napoli q analyst william blair co llc thank you and good morning steve the b2b payments market is an area that youve done american express has done a lot of investing in and i know its off a small base but you bought acompay youre partnering with billcom with mineraltree with coupa with others what is the longterm vision for that business when does it become not off of a small base and is this something that could be or a real material portion of the american express business over the long term stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co yeah well look i think that you call out a number of the partnerships that we have whether its with coupa whether its with sap whether its with ariba obviously the acompay our own product thats only a component of it i would argue that a lot of the b2b is built into the sme piece of it right now because look of our sme volume is nonte and if you are a small business if youre a lawyer or youre a contractor youre buying your supplies to run your company that way so i think what youre really talking about bob is the automation piece of that right and even if you look at our corporate card business our corporate card business obviously theres nobody i mean hardly anybody that is sort of traveling at this point and the te component of our corporate card business is really really down and the reality is is that component though of our business is only of our overall business and yet our corporate card business is not down nearly as much as the corporate card te piece because of some of the inroads weve made with b2b from a corporate perspective and so i think what we probably need to do is figure out how to frame this a little bit better but the reality is is that so much of our sme and corporate spending is actually b2b today what were really talking about is how do you automate it and thats what were working on american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 and i think over time that will become bigger but i would argue a lot of that spending is a large percentage of our growth right now in sme and i think when you get into large corporate there is a big opportunity to do that and thats when you look at the partnership with billcom obviously that is not targeted at a large corporation that is targeted at an sme and our acompay is the same thing so more to come on that but i think it is a growing piece and what youre seeing with the doubling of acompay automation is the actual automation versus the normal card usage that you would normally see operator next well go to the line of jamie friedman with susquehanna james e friedman q analyst susquehanna financial group lllp thank you for the additional disclosures steve jeff i just wanted to ask the gns actually declined less than proprietary i was just maybe a minor detail but i was just wondering is that because of easier comps or is that less te in gns thank you jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co jamie if you think about the fact that because as steve talked about earlier we have had to pull out of the gns business in europe and australia whats left is not necessarily a group of business that is representative of whats happening around the globe and in fact a handful of countries account for a large percentage of the volume and those countries happen to be places like south korea and japan and brazil and israel so particularly with south korea as the largest single country and if you think about how they have done with their particular approach to the control of the virus and the economy it kind of makes sense that it would be a little bit stronger but its not really those numbers arent reflective of kind of an average across the whole rest of the world is what i would say operator next well go to the line of mark devries with barclays mark c devries q analyst barclays capital inc yeah thanks jeff as you alluded to earlier you maintain that to economic capital requirement and prior to the pandemic you had managed down to it quite effectively but its obviously expanded again with the rolloff of balances here and the suspension of the buybacks can you just help us think through when youll be able to return to buybacks is that just going to be fed driven based on the results of your new stress test or is it going to be also selfdetermined based on what you see and when you feel comfortable buying back shares at what pace should we think about you kind of drawing that down back to your longerterm economic capital requirements jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co yeah all good questions mark so a couple things i mean clearly we do need to wait until the fed allows share repurchases again but as i say that id remind everyone that for us the fed requirements on capital are well below our to target so theyre not really a constraint on being at that level theyre only a constraint because right now theyve just blanketly said to everyone you cant do share repurchase so once they give the green light american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 the other thing is we do want to make sure we have visibility into the future direction of the economy as you sit here today weve talked a couple times both steve and i about the fact that while our baseline as things continue to get a little bit better we have to be ready for the fact that they may not well have to see so we need a little bit of economic clarity and then well go and well start working towards our to target i wouldnt expect mark to see to have us do an accelerated share repurchase and get there in one quarter but youll see us go back to the kind of pace we were doing before which will get us there over the course of a relatively small number of quarters operator next well go to the line of meng jiao with deutsche bank meng jiao q analyst deutsche bank securities inc great thanks for taking my call steve i just wanted to check in with you in your conversations with some of your larger partners wanted to get a sense on how theyre doing and whats continuing to be worrisome to them in this climate and going forward thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co if you look weve got lots of partners right i had a conversation with dan schulman he didnt have a lot of worries then and theyre doing great and were doing great partnership with them between pay with points and being embedded within the paypal ecosystem and thats a great partnership for us and when i talked to ed bastian i think delta is going a great job navigating the crisis but theyre at the mercy of how people feel but when you look at our cards with delta that spending is at or better than the spending that we have on all our other products and the same thing when if i talk to chris nassetta and arne sorenson over at marriott chris at hilton their perspective is its a slow recovery here and when you think about the hotel industry conventions is a big part of it and thats not going to probably come back anytime soon but theyre starting to see an uptick in more localized stays where people can drive to a hotel and not travel and even delta is starting to see a little bit of a pickup as well but i think consistent with what ive said i think youre looking to see a tickup in consumer behavior from a travel perspective sort of towards the end of the year first quarter next year but i think were all consistent in terms of how we feel about business travel which is probably not going to be till late or early but what i would say is that whether its hilton ba marriott or delta we are really pleased with the partnerships that we have from a cobrand perspective and those cards in the markets theyre in are performing at or better than our overall portfolio and its because as ive said many times people are vested in their products for the longer term theyre invested in their miles theyre invested in their experiences and when you put great brands like that together and create great experiences people will hold on and thats whats happening and this will pass when its going to pass i cant tell you but it will pass and as a society as a world we will figure out how to navigate this over time operator next well go to the line of craig maurer with autonomous research craig maurer q analyst autonomous research llp good morning jeff and steve american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co hey craig jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co hey craig craig maurer q analyst autonomous research llp so two questions for you first on the merchant discount rate more specifically typical seasonality would suggest that the implied rate or the calculated rate would fall in fourth quarter im curious if your expectation is that te will recover enough in the fourth quarter to offset that typical decline and secondly professional fees were materially higher than what we had expected and was curious if that was driven by support for things like the small business campaign jeffrey c campbell a chief financial officer american express co the answer to the first one is easy and quick i do expect that the steady improvement were seeing in te will more than offset any of the normal seasonality in the discount rate i would remind you that even though te is down a lot more than nonte if you actually look at the rate of improvement from the second quarter to the third quarter craig te is improving faster because it fell so much and so wed expect that in general to continue and then the professional fees remember were constantly moving back and forth between particularly on the technology side work we do inhouse versus work we do through a variety of different firms we work with around the globe so you really need to focus overall on opex which we feel good about being down a couple hundred million again this quarter versus the prior year and of course being down much more than that versus our original plan operator and our final question will come from the line of sanjay sakhrani sanjay sakhrani q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc thanks good morning i wanted to follow up on the improvements going forward through the back part of this year are you guys concerned maybe the cooler weather might affect people eating out you might have some more closures lack of stimulus the small business initiative that you have kind of sunsets so can you just talk about your confidence in the acceleration of the growth and then these new accounts that youre bringing on when do you expect to get traction on the top line from those customers thanks stephen j squeri a chairman chief executive officer american express co look i think just to the first piece of this as i said in my remarks theres just so much uncertainty on everything that you just mentioned which is why i think its so important to keep that flexibility everything that you said could come to pass whether it does or not i do not know and thats why we need to keep flexibility and thats why also we did our investment in sort of small business when we did it we will still do our small business saturday on a global basis were committed to doing that and we will continue to invest in those brandbuilding activities american express co axp corrected transcript q3 earnings call 23oct2020 but i think sanjay look i think when you look at the northeast you dont know whats going to happen in terms of restaurants you dont know if youre going to be at youre going to be at complete closure its going to be pretty hard to eat outside in the snow and things like that but then if you go to florida you have openings right now so you have inconsistency across the united states you have inconsistency across the globe and so were going to have to just continue to watch that and were also going to continue to make sure that we are taking into account from an investment perspective how the two of those things meet up but what i would also tell you is look weve got salespeople out right now doing facetoface calls obviously social distancing masks and so forth and the reality is they want to get out and people want to see them so youve got a very different environment depending upon where you are in the united states as far as sort of top line growth for new cards acquired i think its going to be hard to see the top line growth because youve got this compression thats happened due to travel so well be looking at obviously were adding on more card members theyre adding on spend but even as they add on spend theyre not going to be ph at a seat because theyre not going to have the travel component within early on and so i think well look at it but as far as from the outside perspective youre still going to have this push down on revenue year over year up until the first quarter of sort of next year probably just because of what has happened to the economy and so i think its more second third and fourth quarter of next year where additional card members that we add youll have a growover over but when i think about this and the team thinks about this we anchor everything off i mean we want to get back to that normal state and to get to that growover from so that to us is truly a return to normal vivian y zhou senior vice president headinvestor relations
