president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay good afternoon everyone was a watershed year for western alliance as we drove many of our own records for balance sheet growth total net revenue and earnings while thoughtfully expanding into new business lines and geographies that will make us an even stronger more diversified bank for the year total assets ended just shy of billion with loans growing over the year to billion and deposits rising to billion the strong balance sheet momentum propelled record net revenues of billion net income of million and eps of which is our 12th consecutive year of rising earnings turning to the fourth quarter results wal earned total net revenues of million net income of million and eps of strong balance sheet expansion continued with quarterly loan growth of billion or on a linked quarter annualized basis and deposits rose by billion or annualized loan demand continue to broaden across our business lines with ci loans increasing by billion inclusive of million of ppp runoff along with a billion growth in our residential portfolio and million in cre one of the hallmarks of our national commercial business strategy is the ability to develop niche specialty banking businesses and to attract qualified talent whilst we scale new business lines with superior risk adjusted returns as an example since joining in june our restaurant franchise financing has million in outstanding and is a positive contributor to earnings similarly our texasbased singlefamily home construction cre team has million in approved commitments our loan pipeline and channel checks continue to show a broadening of loan growth in our traditional commercial loan businesses western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 attracting seasoned senior teams to wal provides the opportunity to establish new business lines that ramp up quickly due to their existing client relationships a billion increase in average earning assets drove net interest income growth of million or annualized to million as excess liquidity deployment into loans and loans held for sale contributed significantly to earnings fee income was million representing of total net revenue a decline of million from the prior quarter as mortgage bankingrelated income was impacted by seasonal fourth quarter weakness and the mortgage sectors transition to a rising rate environment which compressed gain on sale margins i would like to reiterate that amerihome is fully integrated into the strategic fabric of western alliance and is thoughtfully managed to maximize value for the entire bank through loan deposit and net interest income growth not just gain on sale margins the b2b corresponding business inside of western alliance has several business levers which can be repositioned to sustain earnings throughout rate and economic cycles given the flexibility of amerihomes business model ongoing mortgage operations can provide multiple revenue opportunities which serve to offset lower gain on sale recognition western alliance has branchlike flexible business model provides us a competitive advantage to leverage operating efficiencies to enhance financial results while investing in business initiatives to drive future growth quarterly adjusted noninterest expenses grew million to million producing an efficiency ratio of to put this in perspective over the last five years total loans and deposits have grown times the rate of operating expenses excluding amerihome productivity improvements provide us with the capability to absorb higher labor costs while continuing to fund product and technology investments total adversely graded assets were flat and quarterly net loan chargeoffs were just basis points western alliance is one of the most profitable banks in the industry with a return on average assets and return on average tangible common equity of and respectively which will continue to support capital accumulation and strong capital levels finally what excites me most are the differentiated technology and banking services that western alliance is increasingly delivering to our clients to solve unique pain points and facilitate transactions we recently announced a partnership with tassat group to deliver blockchainbased payments to our clients using their cash paying platform the launch of this program scheduled for early second quarter will allow western alliance bank clients to transfer funds instantaneously to one another additionally yesterday we announced the acquisition of digital disbursements a leading digital payment platform for the class action legal industry that integrates legal settlement claim process with a multiproduct payment portal this differentiated technology solution enhances the capabilities of western alliance settlement services team and solidifies the bank as an industry leader in a billion legal class action market our national settlement services business developed in and launched in has been described on previous earnings call as deposit initiative one this business has successfully generated billion in deposits as of yearend and we are thrilled to welcome the new team from digital disbursements to help the bank continue to produce unique valueadded solutions to the legal service sector dale will now take you through our financial performance western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 dale m gibbons vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thank you ken for the quarter western alliance generated adjusted net income to common shareholders of million and earnings per share of preprovision net revenue was million total revenue grew million during the quarter to million and net interest income grew million during the quarter to million an increase of primarily as a result of significant balance sheet growth and deployment of liquidity into higher yielding assets average interest earning assets increased billion while the lower yielding cash position indiscernible to from of interest earning assets although not indicated on this page i want to address the characterization of two items in noninterest income regarding the million of securities gains we reported in the second quarter of we purchased over millionish of term municipal bonds that were in sectors hard hit by the pandemic most notably airports in the fourth quarter we sold those bonds as they had recovered in value and the velocity of rate expectations changed i know securities gains are often excluded from core analysis but this seems more like a trading game to us regarding the million in credit guarantee revenue during the quarter we sold a creditlinked note in which the buyer of the note assumes the first loss position of the billion residential portfolio this million in revenue is the currently expected credit losses avoided by selling these bonds i had cecl indiscernible before it was born i dont think its remotely helpful to investors in understanding bank financials and it certainly doesnt improve comparability but i dont know anyone who is taking cecl based credit provisions and excluding them from core which is the same principle here it doesnt make sense to us that if we increase residential loans and book a day one cumulative loss expectation charge and the next day we sell a creditlinked note to put that exact same loss expectation to another party that we should be stuck with the debit and core income before indiscernible the insurance credit for determining earning power overall noninterest income decreased million to million from the prior quarter driven primarily by industrywide gain on sale margin compression as ken noted in anticipation of margin compression we are implementing several initiatives to bridge the gain on sale earnings slowdown with predictable and stable net interest income revenue streams noninterest expense excluding merger and restructure recoveries and loss on extinguishment of debt increased to minus or million resulting in efficiency ratio of for the year western alliance recorded net income of million or per share a increase over eps for net interest income grew million during the year to billion an increase of yearoveryear mainly attributable to increased loan balances and ppp loan fees noninterest income increased million to million in the prior year as amerihome transaction closed early in the second quarter and contributed significantly to fee grab finally noninterest expense increased million or yearoveryear as amerihome employees joined wal in the second quarter turning now to our net interest drivers investment yield increased basis points from the prior quarter or while on a linked quarter basis loan yields declined basis points following the continued strong growth in low to noloss assets such as residential loans and capital call loans and modest yield compression across other loan categories we continue to optimize the deployment of excess liquidity into higher yielding assets and allocated cash yielding basis points of the fed to loans held for sale yielding funding costs were slightly lower from the prior quarter due to the redemption of a million subordinated debt with increased interestbearing deposit cost of basis points and total cost of funds at the spot rate for western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 total deposits which includes noninterest bearing was basis points we expect funding costs to bottom at these levels as rate hikes are forthcoming overall net interest income grew million to million during the quarter or yearoveryear as average interest earning assets increased billion or during the quarter liquidity deployment continued and cash balances were optimized with cash as a portion of average earning assets of a decline from the prior quarter resulting in a loan to deposit ratio of an improvement from prior the net interest margin increased basis points to mainly driven by lower yields on our commercial real estate portfolio and strong growth in low low loss but lower yielding residential loans and capital call lines with regard to asset sensitivity our rate risk profile has been reduced over the last two years as weve added fixed rate residential mortgages and the yield on the majority of available rate commercial loans have bottomed out at their contractual floors we are poised to recognize significant increases in net interest income in the rising rate environment once these floors are no longer inhibiting loan yield escalation and with ongoing balance sheet growth consequently this asset sensitivity is more muted initially but accelerates as interest rates normalize currently billion or of our variable rate loans with floors are at their contractual floors the 25basis point rising rates of these loans will rise off the floors and with 100basispoint rising rates cumulatively will return to variable rate in a rate shock scenario of plus basis points on a static balance sheet net interest income will rise million or using a ramp scenario on a dynamic balance sheet we expect net interest income to increase million in the next months after quarterly rate increases are initiated and given the pandemic the dynamics of our loan floors a million increase over a twoyear timeframe if only four rate hikes are accomplished through in the rising rate environment other areas of western alliances income statement may also be influenced mortgage sector volumes and profitability are expected to be reduced with lower refinance volumes partially offset by increased servicing revenue as the life of mortgage servicing rates are extended these factors may be partially mitigated as we expect deposit betas and earnings credits on billion of deposits to be lower than in the previous rising rate periods and to have longer lag times but could give back collectively about half of the potential net interest income improvement for our interest rate sensitivity amerihome is now fully integrated into wal and gain on sale volume and margin contraction can be minimized by accelerating loan deposit ebo and product channel diversification none of which are available to standalone mortgage operators but are available within a bankowned company we expect the net interest income sourced through amerihome relationships to rise throughout the year countering reductions in traditional mortgage banking income and growing total revenue in net our efficiency ratio improved modestly to from in q3 as our net revenue growth exceeded that of our expense growth one of the key characteristics of our national business line approaches is high operating leverage as mentioned in our prior calls we expect the efficiency ratio to remain in the lower for the year inclusive of planned technology investments new product development expenses and the absorption of higher compensation costs supporting rising rate and deposit account relationships preprovision net revenue increased million or from the prior quarter and from the same period last year this resulted in ppnr roa of for the quarter a decrease of basis points compared to primarily driven by balance sheet growth outpacing ppnr increases this continued strong performance in western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 leading capital generation provides us with significant flexibility to fund ongoing balance sheet growth manage capital actions and meet credit demands robust balance sheet momentum continued during the quarter as loans held for investment increased billion or to billion and deposit growth of billion brought balances to billion at yearend on a quarterly average basis loans held for investment grew and deposits grew in all total assets grew yearoveryear total borrowings increased million over the prior quarter to billion primarily due to increase in overnight borrowings of million and the issuance of million in creditlinked notes partially offset by the redemption of million in subdebt finally tbv per share increased over the prior quarter to and is up yearoveryear we continue to generate consistent organic loan growth from our flexible national business banking strategy and are seeing broadbased demand loans held for investment grew billion in the quarter quarterly loan growth was split almost evenly by an increase in residential real estate loans of million which now comprised of loans and billion also in ci loans as demand for capital call lines and mortgage warehouse lines remained strong and we saw an acceleration of demand for broader business lending nationwide including early success in our new restaurant franchise finance team cre loans grew million predominantly as a result of demand in our hotel franchise finance that bounced back as we expanded relationships with proven clients and sponsors while also obtaining tighter underwriting additionally construction and land loans added million turning to deposits we continue to see broadbased core deposit growth across our business channels deposits grew billion or annualized in the fourth quarter driven by increases in interestbearing dda of billion noninterestbearing dda of million and cds of million partially offset by a reduction in savings and money market funds of million robust fundraising activity in tech and innovation coupled with market share expansion of hoa banking relationships contributed significantly to quarterly deposit growth we also saw a strong performance from regional commercial funds to highlight one of our growing national deposit businesses business escrow services previously called deposit initiative provides escrow payments and administrative services for ma transactions this initiative launched in with a new senior leader and has recruited a highly effective team and has established offices in new york city and minneapolis the team has formed strong relationships with serial acquirers and successfully facilitated over acquisitions which quadrupled our deposit balances in the fourth quarter in this business line to million we now have established ourselves as a formidable market competitor in the space our asset quality remained stable after the significant improvement seen in the prior quarter total classified assets rose million in q4 to million or basis points of total assets special mention loans declined million during the quarter to of funded loans greater than reduction from the prior level since in september total classified assets in special mention loans as a percentage of total assets and funded loans are now lower than in quarterly credit net credit losses were million or basis points of average loans compared to million in q3 our total loan acl increased million from the prior quarter to million due to significant loan growth in low loss segments in all total loan acl to funded loans declined basis points to basis points western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 adjusting for the billion of mortgage warehouse lines and the billion of residential loans covered by the creditlinked notes were ample with firstloss coverage as assumed by a third party the acl ratio is basis points finally given our industryleading return on equity and assets we continue to generate significant capital to fund organic growth and maintain healthy regulatory capital ratios our tangible common equity to total assets of and common equity tier of were both bolstered by net income and the common stock offering under the atm but were impacted this quarter by higher asset growth inclusive of our quarterly cash dividend payment of our tbv per share increased to ill now hand the call back over to ken to conclude with closing comments kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks dale really was an exceptional year from an earnings and loan growth perspective as our distinctive national business strategy model continues to hit on all cylinders and our new initiatives are already paying for themselves were very excited about the diverse set of growth opportunities in front of us as we enter looking forward for the fullyear we expect loans held for investment to grow in excess of billion per quarter from prior guidance of billion to billion or a lowtomid growth rate for the year with flexible origination mix designed to maximize net interest income residential loan purchases will remain strong but the relative contribution to growth will be driven by liquidity so as not to crowd out core commercial lending opportunities deposits will grow in line with loans as we continue normalizing the loantodeposit ratio which today stands at the efficiency ratio for the year will remain in the lower range as we continue to invest in risk management and technology as well as build our teams to respond to growth opportunities we see in front of us we believe that net interest margin declines have abated and expect net interest margin to rise in concert with the fomc actions stable and rising nim coupled with strong balance sheet growth will drive net interest income higher regarding capital our strong organic capital generation continues to support balance sheet growth however quartertoquarter variability around this growth may require incremental capital actions to maintain a baseline cet1 of including sales of creditlinked notes and common stock issuances from time to time to facilitate this we expect to add million shares to our atm capacity in conclusion we continue to see strong pipeline and have the operating flexibility to both execute on nearterm opportunities while investing for longterm growth we believe the current fullyear consensus guide is the floor for but should tilt more to quarters three and four to reflect the seasonal and cyclical nature of our business lines and amhs reposition finally one last note regarding robert sarver our executive chairman our independent directors are actively engaged in monitoring the allegations being investigated by the nba the independent directors have hired an independent outside law firm munger tolles olson to advise the independent directors on this matter and assist them in conducting an investigation to evaluate roberts continued leadership role at the company the investigation is being directed and overseen by the independent directors and to be clear it is not the result of any allegations related to the company discovered by the board or the nba in addition western alliance has and will continue to assist the nba in its ongoing investigation as requested western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 at this time dale and tim bruckner who is in the room our chief credit officer and i are happy to take your questions question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions our first question comes from the line of casey haire with jefferies casey haire q analyst jefferies llc yeah thanks good morning guys question on the balance sheet growth guide specifically the deposits i mean the i think we all appreciate that the loan generation is pretty strong and you guys are capable of doing more than that billion and to the extent that you guys do it sounds like you want to keep the loantodeposit ratio on the low can you match that loan growth on the deposit side which will obviously be a little bit harder in a rising rate environment kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp the answer is yes okay thats why we made the loan and deposits just dollars growing the same amount but our pipelines look very strong and i just want to reinforce the billion loan guidance floor and the billion deposit guidance floor are really at the low end as before our pipelines are very strong and our deposit pipelines are looking at the moment for the first quarter closer to double the floor amount so we think were off to a very good start we think deposits will be strong throughout the year and were very excited about what were seeing in the marketplace dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp casey regarding your comment about keeping our loantodeposit ratio in the in the low so we look at held for sale loans as not really an alternative to the loan growth thats an alternative to cash for us its just a much better yielding one and for the most part theyre already they have a great riskadjusted capital ratio on them because of youre putting those loans to a gse and so instead of keeping money at the fed or some other ph due from bank putting it into these shortterm basically puts that we have to the gses on these mortgages is a much better deal but thats where the substitution is so i would look for our loantodeposit ratio to continue to climb through the get back into more like the lower kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah and just i always keep reminding people that held for sale were generating yield on that or what is basically a threeweek money market asset guaranteed by the government so we like that strategy casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and i understood on the deposit growth pipelines how much of it do you expect from this from the recently announced tassat partnership im just trying to get a gauge on obviously weve seen that at western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 other banks be very explosive deposit generator what kind of forecast are you guys baking in looking ahead in kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp fair question right now we havent baked in anything so when we discussed where i just said that the floor is billion but i think well be more likely to double that for q1 much of that incremental growth is coming from our efforts at amerihome to drive a higher deposit growth into the company so both the digital disbursements announcement today and the blockchain announcement connected to tassat we have not put any numbers any deposit numbers into our forecast this year we are very hopeful and we expect for those programs to generate greater deposits but at this time our first goal is lets get that blockchain program with tassat launched in early second quarter and once we see the reception we can then determine how to give you some guide on the future deposit growth but i should say both of those programs the national business line strategy settlement services and also business escrow services they both report to dale so do you want to add anything to that dale dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no no thats absolutely correct i mean i would i would tell you we have high hopes for what can be executed here and weve already started conversations with ph the thirdparty but nothing is baked into what were talking about casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good and just last one for me on the gain on sale line can you just give us some updated thoughts on where we can see the gain on sale margin trend from that bps here in the fourth quarter and can you in the production volumes obviously can you run gain on sale pressure with stronger volumes thanks kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so one of the things that were doing what we call either repositioning or pivoting amerihome is to buy and sell nonqm and jumbo loans we started this immediately when we bought the company we set up the program we have clients at amerihome we had to go out educate train and then approve them to make nonqm and jumbo loans today clients are approved and theyre generating about million a month in mortgage loans i tell you all this because as we go through the year were going to be leaving the conventional market which is seeing more compression spread and to the extent that western alliance or the commercial side of our balance sheet doesnt want any of those mortgages or it doesnt hit our riskadjusted returns we will then sell them off in the marketplace and we think those margin spreads there are much higher somewhere to basis points today so that was a long winded answer to say as we reshift the focus inside of amerihome the lower margin spreads today will grow throughout the year and thats why just bringing something back to my comments at the end thats why i said hey when you think about our earnings for i said lets tilt them a little bit more to the back end as we roll out all those nonqm and jumbo programs to our 850member client base western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay so the million is thats what you did in the fourth quarter how big can that number grow to kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah you know what thats a very sizable number and ill just say it could be very sizable and let us get through another quarter and start building on it and then the numbers we give you will have one a lot well have a lot more confidence in and itll give us more credibility but we see that number building all throughout the year and especially into were very optimistic about this casey haire q analyst jefferies llc okay very good thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of brock vandervliet with ubs kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp hey brock brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc thanks hey good morning i think the we should go back to the rate sensitivity i think the most unsettling and maybe complex slide was slide and that last bullet and dale maybe if you could just go through that again in terms of i think everyone gets the basic rate sensitivity its the offset that you may have because of the mortgage businesses that i think are throwing investors dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah appreciate that brock i mean thats correct i mean we obviously saw a cyclical and seasonal pressure in q4 in the mortgage space and in anticipation of kind of the rate increases if this rate trajectory were to continue we think that on that baseline giving to what ken referred to in terms of the present business mix will undertake undergo additional pressure as rates rise or basis points which crimps the noninterest revenue relative to that operation also noted there is that were we have certain deposits with earnings credit rates i think thats going to be much less significant than the potentially the mortgage element so but what this doesnt include is whats ken referring what ken referred to as the pivot more to the nqm more to the jumbo mortgage origination product and these other initiatives that are being done there that will mitigate that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 its it also doesnt have kind of factored in what they expect to do in terms of growth so last year we mentioned we had we have mortgage warehouse clients that we have not mined for msr lines for warehouse lines and for deposits from that group that compares to just over that we have on the bank ourselves and so we now have staffed up for that and we expect to mine that group already and as we get into that that will improve i think what their performance has been and on the net interest income side mitigate that but youre still going to see pressure on the fee revenue side from mortgage operations brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay i understand that i just keep coming back to this that last bullet point but does the last bullet point where interest rate sensitivity says it could be dampened by half do we therefore pro rate the nii impact you show on the left side or totally different dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no no no and maybe we should be more fair here its not just the rate sensitivity is going to be cut by half its that the addition to ppnr from a higher rate environment so were showing so for example million over two years and an eightquarter rising rate environment were saying that okay if i that number could be more like million or million flowing to ppnr million is what youre going to see in net interest income but youre going to see lower ramps or slower levels in fee revenue so thats the ppnr change as opposed to just net interest income when you get to the haircut potentially brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay and just in the resi loan yields just the detail here the loan yields continue to compress ph to i would have expected those went the other direction and lifted this quarter and maybe thats a mix issue in terms of what youre selling versus retaining could you just cover that dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah youre right what were our current on the run acquisitions now were in the lower and so i would think that that has bottomed out brock vandervliet q analyst ubs securities llc okay all right thanks for the questions operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc hey good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess just first i wanted to follow up on the legal investigation that you flagged ken one is the expense related to the initiation of the investigation this quarter and should we expect the legal expense line going back to where it has been just from a numbers standpoint and then what drew management to or the board to initiate this because it felt like at least about days ago you didnt see a need for having in a standalone investigation versus what the espn was doing so would love to hear some color around that how quickly can this get wrapped up so that this no longer remains an overhang on the stock kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so let me take the expense question first really theres not been any major impact at all to the legal line and im not expecting that to balloon out in any way shape or form so we answer questions that come to us from the nba i dont expect this investigational review to really add in any material way to the legal expense line item to your second point i would probably correct your assumption upfront the independent board members have been very much engaged from the very beginning of this espn report and nba investigation and this is just the next step and theyre doing their appropriate due diligence and handling their fiduciary responsibilities to the company so i just think its the its just the next step in the whole process ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc and is there a timeline by when we probably conclude all of this kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so really this is being handled by the independent directors and their counsel and im really not in a position to comment on the scope or duration of the investigation sorry ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and i guess a separate question just around rate sensitivity i think you mentioned that you expect the margin to have bottomed out and move higher as the fed moves dale if you can give us a sense of understanding the rate floors what should be the lift to the margin from fed hikes if any if you could quantify that that would be helpful dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well yeah so out of the gate its going to be fairly muted i mentioned that we have of our ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc yeah western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp variable rate loans are at the floor were not going to see much there conversely i think theres a lot of liquidity in the industry and i dont see where pricing pressure would come from other institutions or on a competitive basis to increase funding costs and so it does start out fairly modestly and then climbs so i mean its going to be kind of singledigit millions for the first increase and then the next number will be a multiple of that and then itll probably double again as we get say to basis points off of the floor and then its going to be more ratable based upon the overall mix of our loans that are variable rate which is substantial ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and if i can sneak in one last one i think ken you mentioned that you think the eps from consensus should be a floor you should do better than that what are you assuming in terms of gain on sale income given what the forward curve is telling us about rates do you see how meaningful of a decline do you see in gain on sale relative to the fourth quarter levels kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp well so the first quarter is also seasonally challenged as is q4 and so i wouldnt look for improvement in gain on sale in after that i think that sector starts picking up im going to say kind of early spring late winter summer march timeframe and so were looking for improvement in q2 and q3 going forward and then by the time we get to the second half of the year our mix will have changed and will be less dependent upon gse paper and more on nq nonqualified mortgage paper which again has tighter margins in it so were looking for things to be improving really starting in the second quarter but carrying through ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it thanks for taking my questions operator your next question comes from the line of timur braziler with wells fargo timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi good morning kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp good morning timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 just to circle back on the last comment on residential production i guess is there a good way to think about it kind of the next two quarters of the product out of amerihome is still primarily conforming youre going to use that time to continue building the resi book on balance sheet and then as that product switches to nonconforming or largely more so nonconforming in the backend of the year all that production will be sold off and i guess when that switch occurs will that trigger a change in your appetite for production out of amerihome or will that level still be the same just going through the gain on sale line dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i just want to correct one assumption first what were buying from amerihome today or what amerihome is selling to the commercial side of our business are the nonqm and jumbo loans all right so were not housing these conventional loans on our balance sheet that they buy in as part of their correspondent lending business and then they turn around and then they put them to the gses so for us today we both have we have an amerihome inflow for nonqm and a jumbo loans and we had this program started before we purchased amerihome and so we have from our or so clients a group that continue to offer us forward flows so as amerihomes volume picks up well probably decrease the forward flows from our existing customer base but always looking at what is the best return we can get either from amerihome or from our existing customer base does that help you timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay thats helpful yeah thats helpful thank you and then just maybe looking at the average levels of loans held for sale versus the period end balance is that the typical trend that those balances kind of pick up throughout the quarter and then theres more selling towards quarterend and i guess as we head into next year are those average balances kind of what we should be using for our assumptions for loans held for sale or is there going to be a stepdown here in the first quarter dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so you may have noticed this before we had amerihome timur but wed say our loans tend to peak at or near kind of month end and especially quarterend and so our average balance tends to lag that of our ending periods i call it the telephone wire although there arent any more telephone wires anymore kind of a phenomenon where it picks up and then groups down again and so to basically address that and to have a more stable earning asset level throughout the quarter intra quarter we have had to reverse basically plan for the heldforsale book at amerihome because thats such a short window we can play with that and so we have driven up average balances lower than the ending balances and you add them together and you get something a little more stable in terms of averages and endings going forward i think were there were weve taken the heldforsale portfolios kind of where we want them to be im not looking for continued growth in there neither on an ending nor an average basis necessarily and meanwhile again now that weve ramped that up now that we have sopped up the liquidity that we have when we acquired amerihome we were sitting on billion in cash where our focus is now okay what do we want to put on the heldforinvestment book and thats what ken was referring to in terms of continuing to grow the residential piece but with these nonqualified mortgages that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 are really good quality these are low ltv theyre in the midtohigh on ltv ph fico debt to income in the mid and we think thats going to be pretty impervious to kind of swings in the business cycle and the residential valuation cycle as well timur f braziler q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay great thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of brad milsaps with piper sandler brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co hey good morning guys dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp good morning brad brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co dale youre using kind of the nba data as a proxy your mortgage market share has kind of been plus or minus for the past couple of quarters i was curious if you had an idea of kind of where you might see that increasing to over the next i dont know months as you guys kind of continue to take share if thats one way to think about it dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp well we have a pretty flexible model whereby we can step up on the share space to continue to take volume so i think thats going to really depend upon what else we see kind of going on we are sensitive to the how the elastic demand and pricing is in that space we dont want to come in so strong that we start kind of pushing down pricing overall but within that parameter i think were we could be taking up share to again address the expectations that we have from amerihome away from what theyre doing on our balance sheet brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co and just curious you addressed kind of the level of held for sale thats going to remain pretty stable from here but just kind of curious if you do hold those for longer and generate more interest income does that impact your gain on loan sale at all just kind of curious if theres a bit of a tradeoff there maybe were not seeing it as much in fee income but youre picking up more nii just kind of curious to kind of how the two pieces might work together western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah let me say bingo thats exactly what the conversation is and we work with our we work with amerihome very closely to make sure that the net economics are better for the bank whether it be just taking the loans in holding them for three weeks and then putting to the gses were getting a full gain on sale that way or by having them reside and nest on our balance sheet for a longer period so we look at it both ways and wherever the best economics are that drives what we do brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co so if those loans just sort of reached kind of a steady level and you guys continue to take share you could actually see all else being equal that maybe the gain on loan sale fee income line improved a bit first quarter kind of notwithstanding due to seasonality dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp correct yeah thats a fair comment brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay and then just on the servicing piece i know its not a big number but youve got a pretty large servicing portfolio now and i think youre only generating a couple of million bucks can you kind of talk about some of the puts and takes there it just seems like a low number again not huge numbers but just kind of curious where that could head dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i mean i appreciate that brad because so i mean the servicing piece it has been affected by msr dispositions weve undertaken theres deconversion costs associated with that that have come out of that line as a ph contra route and so slowing down msr dispositions could increase that number as well we also think that im going lets say the back half of last year there was more refi activity than was expected and i think what the reason for that is because there has been such an appreciation of home values nationwide that other some people even as though it wasnt necessarily economically and advantageous to refi did so anyway because they wanted cash out to be able to take some of that equity out to do for whatever they pleased as we see rates rise more i dont know that that trade really is going to make sense i think youre probably better off leaving your first mortgage as is getting a home equity credit line on top of it at a higher rate rather than refinancing the whole thing so i think that may slow down also if that were to slow down that would also result in less amortization of msr premiums as those lives lengthen out and thats irrespective of that they probably will lengthen out just as rates rise to begin with which both of those will be positive for servicing rather brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co okay thank you and then final question for me just for ken on the ci side of things with some really nice growth this quarter i was curious if you could just maybe offer a little more color is that line utilization coming western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 back with some of that purchased again do you feel like theres some real momentum out there on the ci side as things get back to normal and businesses rebuild inventories and things like that or is that kind of still to come in terms of the growth youre seeing kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah i would say the growth were seeing is what weve been seeing almost throughout the year okay that warehouse funding for the most part has been very strong throughout the year a little bit quieter in q4 though subscription lines and capital call lines continue to perform well and they did so in this quarter as well and they were up about let me say ill tell you what they were up rather right here yeah they were up about million so that helped we had good growth in the hotel sector we grew that about million and then our all our regional lines or our businesses they grew collectively this quarter nearly over billion as well so it was a good quarter id say and sometimes ill just say when we talk about warehouse lending there are three components to warehouse lending the traditional warehouse lending was relatively flat but msr line that we capture in that number they grew nearly million and then we have a note financing business again under the whole heading of warehouse lending and that grew another billion so thats where we saw the growth for q4 brad milsaps q analyst piper sandler co great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of chris mcgratty with kbw christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks for the question dale i know you mentioned the low on the efficiency ratio im interested kind of near term as this mortgage business gets reset a bit can you maybe speak to some of the flexible expenses that would come out dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so well a few things so q1 is always a scenario thats a little bit tighter we see a reload on expenses payroll taxes certain of our professional fees and then the revenues contracted because theres only were dropping days to and thats going to have an effect on the efficiency ratio theyre probably going to take it to im going to say in q1 but then from there what amerihome was can do is again kind of process and rightsize whatever makes sense in terms of where they are on their profile given their opportunity but overall we think were pretty strong in terms of on our efficiency profile and expense outlines christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc great thanks and would you mind i was trying to catch up you said something about guidance was it that youre comfortable with the consensus out there i missed that western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah thats the floor christopher mcgratty q analyst keefe bruyette woods inc got it thank you operator your next question comes from the line of brandon king with truist securities brandon king q analyst truist securities inc hey i wanted to touch on loan growth expectations with the guidance of billion per quarter are you expecting a similar composition as last year q4 for this year and do you anticipate any changes within that composition especially with the change in strategy with amerihome in the back half of the year dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah no i think in general what were seeing now and we expect to continue is a broadening out of credit demand across our business lines and so it started during the pandemic it was very narrow it was basically mortgage warehouse lines and residential real estate and capital call lines now were seeing as ken mentioned weve got weve seen increases in tech increases in hotel increases in the regions i think thats going to continue where you could see maybe a little bit of an accordion element is in the residential side so if our deposit growth shines were not going to push obviously on credit underwriting and so the valve to pick up that increased liquidity is going to really push on the residential piece on the nqm that weve talked about and so at a baseline level performance i expect to see kind of the residential fees to be somewhere similar to what you alluded to maybe it was just over in q4 something in the and or whatever is probably pretty typical if were outsized on deposit growth then youre going to see the residential piece pick that up brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thats helpful and then you mentioned how hotel franchise finance bounced back in the quarter you also mentioned tighter underwriting and i wonder if i could any more details on what sort of underwriting standards youre applying now compared to where they were before kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp our chief credit officer has been sitting here very quietly were going to give him a chance to answer a credit question finally timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp thanks we i think have benefited over the last year really in being able to underwrite some of the best structures in part because there was some pullback so what were still seeing in that is very low loantocost western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 loantovalue advances were seeing it with the flags and asset type that we prefer so were seeing it in our target market and were typically still underwriting with goingin reserves that we wouldnt have prior to the pandemic so i would call it conservative and thoughtful underwriting and wellpriced kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah when you mean reserves you mean both operating reserves for somewhere between and a 12month period and also payment reserves for principal and interest again for a to 12month period timothy r bruckner a chief credit officer western alliance bancorp correct thanks ken brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then as far as the loan yields on that book how have they trended since theres been sort of a reopening of the economy have loan yields kind of come down some based on what they were last year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so in the midst of the pandemic we were doing some underwriting still with on hotel properties and into the first part of the yields were higher there because there was less competition and thats what we demanded to do underwriting at that time in addition to what tim said we had tighter underwriting standards so as more people have come back into the market a number of our floors have dropped were still getting better pricing in that segment than we are elsewhere in our book of business but yes it has come down somewhat throughout still great very good risk adjusted returns here brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay and then lastly i wanted to touch expenses i just wanted to get a sense of what your investment priorities are for the year and also get an understanding as far as how hiring has gone i know talent acquisition has been tough in this inflationary environment and with the great resignation but i just wanted to get an update on that and the plans for the year kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah so we had a net growth in hiring this quarter which is good i agree that there is a war for talent and were out there trying to hire as many people as we can as soon as we can and we have appropriately so changed compensation level inside of the bank to retain people as well as to attract new people what i said in my opening remarks our efficiency ratio our productivity improvements have been so significant that its been able to capture the increase in the cost of new hires and retaining people so thats question one what was the other question indiscernible brandon king q analyst truist securities inc western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 yeah kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp on investments the priority starts with risk management and technology all right we need to have that right given the strong growth profile and trajectory that we have okay you can do some simple math and say hey pretty soon these guys are going to get to billion and they and we need to be ready to be regulated as a billion bank you dont start that when you get there weve started that actually last year we started it so that investment has been in our numbers and will continue to be in our numbers both for risk management and technology for new business lines its interesting the new business teams that we have brought on fortunately because theyre such senior seasoned bankers with great relationships theyd come on and probably inside of six months on a run rate basis those groups are paying for themselves already so we dont have a large trend in bringing on new teams at least we havent yet all right and then in terms of stuff that were doing organically embedded in our low efficiency ratio guide is the incremental work were doing for example with tassat to get our blockchain payment system up and running but also included in there are new business lines that we are beginning to build or examine that we hope will help us towards the back end of and give us some momentum into so we always look at our budgets as a eight rolling quarter process so we can lay out what we think is the appropriate spend in year one and begin to see whats going to happen in year two in terms of a payback brandon king q analyst truist securities inc okay thank you very much dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of gary tenner with da davidson gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co thanks good morning a couple questions first dale i just want to make sure i understood kind of the mechanics or context around that credit loss note recovery is it simply that the additional clns issued in the fourth quarter reduces the exposure under the expected loss model that thats why youre dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co indiscernible western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp no yes exactly so we sold the creditlinked note that so we received the proceeds of about million and with that they take first loss the buyers of that note take a first loss on a billion portfolio of residential mortgages and so we have no loss unless the losses on those loans is more than which seems beyond astronomical to me i mean weve never had a loss on these loans to begin with and so we have but in any event thats what theyre responsible for that and so but yet because the loans are still in our books within cecl the acl we have a reserve on those loans of million that thats what the acl computation is and so with that now that we have somebody else taking that loss were still responsible for that loss but we have a direct offset that we would claim that loss by paying back the notes that they bought from us the note amount less the losses that have been put to them because they own the first loss position on that and thats the million gain so you could do this in the same quarter i mean and we are i mean were originating residential mortgages we expect that were going to continue to put them out to a third party in most cases the reason why we do that is because once youve done this process you reduce it from a risk weighting to a risk weighting it is cheaper to do this and to pay the note to this third party than it is to issue common stock to cover that reduction in rwa kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and i indiscernible gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp but one other thing that dale said i would like everyone on the phone to know that were going to be coming to market with this on a periodic basis so were youre going to see this happen again during the course of either another time or maybe at least two times so this income that were getting from it is going to find its way into the pl and then if dale you want to take the second half of that it then accretes back in and is a cost dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp if you dont have losses kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp if you dont have losses it accretes back in as a cost dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 its just parallel to what is in the acl so we have million in the acl that is a contraasset and now we have million that is a contra debit or contra liability that takes off of how much we owe this market this should go back and forth i mean theyre just you staple them together that was my point gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah right so it just effectively shows up on the fee line versus via a reduction to the acl which would be a little more intuitive so my indiscernible gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co question is what the first time you did this back in the what it was in the second quarter why was there not a similar kind of turnout dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean there effectively was indiscernible but i would say that the dollar amount for this piece is larger than the one that first one was yeah it was only from the one for the first one so the million is overwhelmingly the residential gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co okay thanks for the color and then just one additional question ken in terms of your comments regarding a kind of shift in production and i think a third of the clients approved on the nonq on the jumbo doing about million a month so if you roll that out and all your clients are approved and they double their production thats billion to billion a quarter give or take in terms of that type of production so is the idea that the overall mix will shift and be maybe of that kind of production and the rest will remain conventional is that the way to think about it kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp boy i love your math that of clients are all in on the program so i love your enthusiasm on that but we know thats not going to be the case so i dont think youre going to see billion a quarter but i do think towards the end of you should be able to see from wherever we are about billion a quarter okay and a lot of this is going to depend on how quickly we can get our client base educated trained and approved and then get them rolling out this product which we think they want and then again for us were going to look at the dynamics and were going to we set internal benchmarks here and if it is better first of all it all depends on our liquidity all the time and how much we carry on the balance sheet but if we see better economics to sell a loan away from us thats what were going to do if we see better economics that we want to keep it thats what were going to do and so it provides us a lot more optionality it just goes to show really what weve been saying since the day we purchased amerihome that a mortgage company inside of a bank has many levers that it can pull that provide income streams to the parent company that they could not pull or use if they were a standalone company and so thats what we kind of like about amerihome and so i hope that answers your question western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 gary peter tenner q analyst da davidson co yeah thanks guys appreciate it dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thanks operator your next question comes from the line of david chiaverini with wedbush securities david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc hey thanks a question on the ma pipeline particularly nonbank as it relates to you made the announcement about digital disbursements any could you talk about your appetite for additional transactions like that kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp so as a general rule one of the first lenses of thought that goes into whether or not we want to do a transaction is what is the return on managements time weve got a lot of organic growth opportunities and we are as you can tell very excited by them and as youve seen from our production either on the loan side or deposit side being very successful with the ones that weve launched and the ones that weve been cultivating so the first thing is return on management time if there are products or certain niches that are very good for us to bolt on to our existing program we like those all right were not out there like many of the other banks fishing for a partner to do a sizable deal i always say that thats not were looking for but of course were pretty opportunistic if something falls in our lap we will quickly recalibrate and see if it works for us but right now thats not the conversations were having where its more along the smaller lines and also really on what can generate transitional or transformational growth like we think the blockchain payment program can do over time once we get comfortable with the mechanics of it and once we bring in incremental clients to the company david john chiaverini q analyst wedbush securities inc that makes sense thank you operator your next question comes from the line of jon arfstrom with rbc capital markets jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc hey thank you for taking the questions just two questions on the guide for eps in youre talking about a steeper ramp maybe later in the year how steep of a ramp are you talking about i have a for the first quarter a for the fourth quarter on consensus and i dont really care about the first quarter im interested more in the fourth quarter so i just help us understand how steep that ramp is throughout the year western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah so i would consider haircutting your q1 a bit and say that number was throwing onto the back half would be appropriate for us kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay and you feel like its sustainable eps growth i know you talked about some of the carveouts but again im just trying to think about i know thats a long way out but thats sustainable is what im thinking about dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp yeah i mean so and really im going to look to the balance sheet for this but we believe weve got momentum on these on what we put out here already as we indicated we havent factored in any of these kind of new developments and initiatives both with regarding the deposit side as well as some of the amerihome deals we are constructive on the economy overall as well and i dont know how many rate increases were going to get but to me its probably going to be at least for were personally dialing in three this year march june and september but i dont think theyre going to be done with that and that should give momentum also so yes i mean i realize there are implications of what were talking about kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah jon your question jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc let me just let me ask you one more thing ken before and this may tie into if you want to add on to it but dale you just touched on it theres a lot of questions on mortgage and its i know that theyre not the easiest to answer but do you guys want higher shortterm rates is that positive for earnings and if someone takes the over on rate hikes is that positive for you when you mix it all together kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp yeah the answer is yes go back to that slide well jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah western alliance bancorp wal corrected transcript q4 earnings call 28jan2022 kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp and dale was saying those numbers represent net interest income increases take half of that and that falls to the ppnr line right and so yeah its beneficial for the company and certainly once you clear the third going on to the fourth rate hike all our most of our floors will be in the rearview mirror and were going to get a higher beta improvement on the loans that we carry jon jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yes okay and then just last one longer term return on tangible thinking as rates rise i know you got some provision questions in there but can you hold this level of returns dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp i mean were at right now on cet1 could that stay to so theres maybe a little bit of capital implication there i do think that were as we said were going to see margin expansion particularly in a rising rate environment that would hold us pretty close to where we are now even if rates didnt move up or they plateau more quickly i still dont see how we fall out of the jon arfstrom q analyst rbc capital markets llc yeah okay all right thanks for taking the questions dale m gibbons a vice chairman chief financial officer western alliance bancorp thank you kenneth a vecchione a president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp our pleasure operator there are no further questions in queue ill now turn the call back over to ken kenneth a vecchione president chief executive officer director western alliance bancorp okay i just
