and net earnings of over billion which drove yeartodate roe of and rote of our performance underscores the strength of our client franchise and the constructive but more normalized market environment relative to a year ago our results also reflect ongoing progress on the firms strategic priorities across all four of our businesses as laid out at our investor day in investment banking we continue to benefit from our leading ma franchise given this position we observed certain secular changes driving strategic activity as our key clients emerged from the pandemic the drive for scale the push to achieve operating efficiency the shift to a digital economy across a broader industry set we have maintained a number one rank in completed ma for of the last years and have been the leader in equity underwriting for of the last years were broadening our transaction banking platform in june we the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 launched in the uk and we will now focus on expanding into japan and other geographies although we are early in the rollout initial client feedback has been quite positive we delivered solid results in global markets where recent market share gains contributed to our performance we continued to deploy balance sheet to support client activity and we are further expanding our means of engagement with our clients across both traditional and digital platforms a good example is our marquee platform where we are collaborating with msci to deliver improved portfolio analytics for our institutional clients versus via apis in asset management our assets under supervision hit another record of trillion as we serve clients by delivering bestinclass investment opportunities across a growing spectrum of traditional and alternative asset classes we also continue to transition the business to more thirdparty funds where we have raised billion in gross commitments across the range of alternative investment strategies since our investor day additionally during the quarter we received preliminary approval for a joint venture with icbc chinas largest bank the jv will combine our expertise in asset management with icbcs extensive access to retail and institutional clients the partnership is a testament to our longstanding relationship with icbc and represents a significant opportunity for us to grow internationally in consumer wealth management we are seeing solid inflows in pwm from new and existing clients and ongoing synergies with our ayco and pfm businesses we are also advancing on our vision of creating the leading digital consumer banking platform where customer satisfaction with our products and services continues to be very high this quarter we launched apple card family which allows coowners on the same account to build credit together as equals in addition as we grow markets invest and prepare for the rollout of checking and other services we are building a more comprehensive consumer banking offering allin the progress on our strategic priorities combined with our continued execution reaffirms my confidence in the strength of our franchise and the increasing durability of our revenues reflecting this confidence our board of directors declared a increase in our quarterly dividend to a share this follows an increase of over in taken together we have increased the dividend by since i took my seat as ceo while future increases wont necessarily be of this magnitude we continue to prioritize a robust dividend as a part of our capital management philosophy with that let me now turn to the operating environment on page its clear that were in the middle of a significant economic rebound this is particularly true in countries like the us and china driven by the lifting of health and safety restrictions amid comprehensive vaccination programs the broader economic improvement has also been underpinned by unprecedented support by central banks and in the united states the prospect of further fiscal stimulus in the form of infrastructure spending a quarter ago i mentioned my concerns about the prospect of the us economy overheating but recent commentary from the federal reserve indicates that the central bank is focused on this risk which supports our economist view that inflationary pressures might be transitory and that any resulting risks could be adequately managed from here i remain concerned about the prospect of a pandemic resurgence the delta variant should it spread further could steer policy actions that slow economic growth we are already seeing this play out in places like hong kong and australia and potentially in parts of europe while vaccine takeup is progressing it is not consistent across communities and nations including parts of the united states widespread vaccine distribution the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 and high vaccine rates are critical to open and thriving economies i want to urge policymakers government officials and business leaders across jurisdictions to do all they can to facilitate these efforts at goldman sachs we are running programs to facilitate faster vaccinations for our people and their families in the united states hong kong and india among other locations building on the support we are providing communities in which we operate as we all navigate the challenges of this pandemic more broadly as risk managers we closely monitor developments and remain attentive to a variety of potential risks away from the challenges associated with covid right now the geopolitical landscape most notably china and cybersecurity are top of mind as always we remain committed to helping our clients navigate these and other risks amid an everchanging market backdrop as i look ahead i remain optimistic about the opportunity set for goldman sachs our investment banking backlog is at a record level as strategic discussions with our corporate client base remain high reflective of elevated ceo confidence and the prospect of continued economic recovery while consumer confidence may prove more volatile as supplemental benefits expire in the us corporate clients remain steadfast in their efforts to emerge stronger from the pandemic in our markets business ongoing client engagement and increased market share have strengthened our competitive positioning notwithstanding more normalized flows and spreads relative to a year ago and across our investing businesses the current rate environment and search for yield are driving demand from both institutional and individual investors for our worldclass scaled investment platform before i turn it over to stephen id like to close with a few final thoughts on the people of goldman sachs we are an incredibly dedicated and resilient team and im so proud of how weve worked tirelessly to serve our clients amid the challenges of the last months again and again ive heard from our clients that they say goldman sachs is ahead of the curve and that the engagement from our people has been stronger than ever speaking of that as many of you know we formally welcomed our colleagues in new york dallas salt lake city hong kong and other locations to office this summer with roughly of our people in these offices back on a regular basis i can tell you that seeing them in our buildings again has been completely invigorating we recognize that various geographies are navigating different stages of the pandemic and well continue to provide our colleagues with the support they need going forward we look to reopen more locations consistent with health and safety guidelines of each city in which we operate ive heard from so many of our people over the last few weeks that they are glad to be back in the office and clients appreciate that we are showing up we have always given our people the flexibility they need to manage their professional and personal lives and we will continue to do so that said i believe bringing us back together forging the close bonds that support a culture of collaboration has renewed the sense of teamwork and apprenticeship that allows our people and our business to thrive im particularly excited to see nearly interns and new hires who are joining us this summer many inperson working sidebyside with longtenured professionals of goldman sachs ill close by saying im very pleased with how our people continue to deliver for our clients and our shareholders im especially confident in the strength of our client franchise amid an improving economic backdrop importantly we are making progress in executing our strategy and i believe we are on a path to sustainable midteens returns with that ill turn it over to stephen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 stephen m scherr chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc thank you david and good morning i will start with our business performance by segment beginning on page investment banking produced its second highest quarterly net revenues of billion financial advisory revenues of billion reflected an elevated number of deal closings in the quarter and the increasing market position of our business as we have expanded our client footprint we maintained our number one league table position for the yeartodate participating in billion of announced transactions with a volume market share of activity continues to be strong across geographies particularly in the americas with strength across all industry groups reflecting the breadth of our franchise underwriting performance remain very strong with its second highest quarterly revenues following on from a record performance in the first quarter equity underwriting performance in particular continued to be strong generating billion in revenues amid elevated ipo activity and representing our third consecutive quarter with revenues of over billion we ranked number one globally in equity underwriting for the yeartodate with volumes in the first half climbing to billion across deals that represents volume market share of up basis points versus full year notably we led over ipos for the yeartodate more than all of last year in debt underwriting net revenues were million with performance supported by strong highyield volumes and importantly robust acquisition financing activity including lbos as well as strong ma and financial sponsor activity this performance reflects the integrated nature of our financing and advisory businesses as well as our dominant share in financial sponsor activity additionally esg remained a focus of the market particularly in europe with strong issuance volumes across sustainabilitylinked bonds and loans we expect this trend to continue in future quarters notwithstanding the realization of record revenue in the first half of the year as david noted our investment banking backlog ended the quarter at a fresh record high with sequential growth supported by sustained ma activity as well as replenishment from underwriting transactions corporate lending results of million reflect revenues from transaction banking and middle market and relationship lending net of approximately million of losses on hedges in place with respect to the relationship loan book transaction banking is performing well the business is approaching clients generating roughly billion in deposits with an increasing percentage becoming operational moving to global markets on page segment net revenues were billion in the quarter driven by solid client activity and a generally supportive marketmaking environment our franchise continued to exhibit strength across both ficc and equities notwithstanding more normalized activity versus a year ago when we experienced significant dislocation and volatility driving elevated client volumes we remain focused on building upon recent market share gains and have made advances in digital platforms to sustain strong performance in this segment beginning with ficc on page second quarter net revenues were billion in rates performance was impacted by spread compression amid lower volatility though activity remained high with a number of macroeconomic crosscurrents around economic recovery and inflation in commodities we saw solid performance across our increasingly diversified business with contributions from oil natural gas and power ags and metals and active risk management in a dynamic market characterized by healthy client flows the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 in mortgages strong performance was helped by activity in our residential loan trading business offset by lower results in agency mortgages the business continues to diversify its revenue across marketmaking loan origination and financing across both credit and currencies lower volatility more muted volumes and spread compression led to more modest performance relative to recent quarters though market share gains helped offset the effects of a relatively subdued trade environment ficc financing revenues of million were driven by mortgage lending offset by lower repo performance moving to equities net revenues for the second quarter were billion as we actively deployed our balance sheet to intermediate risk and support client activity equities intermediation produced net revenues of billion with performance driven by the global scale and breadth of our client franchise in both cash and derivatives in cash we facilitated client flows across high and lowtouch channels and in derivatives we saw solid performance in emea following a more orderly market in european dividends relative to a year ago and stronger results in structured products across geographies equities financing revenues of million were strong given record average balances in our prime business growth in balances were a product of rising equity markets and more significant engagement among existing and new clients while growth in equities financing remains a strategic priority we nonetheless maintain a very disciplined focus on risk management pricing and structural terms of engagement moving to asset management on page in the second quarter we generated record revenues of billion management and other fees totaled million which rose yearonyear despite approximately million of fee waivers on our money market funds these waivers carry over from prior quarters and are consistent with industry practice in this rate environment incentive fees for the quarter were million equity investments produced record net gains of billion amid a supportive market backdrop particularly in growth equity which drove roughly onethird of these revenues the growth equity business has a 15year track record of generating strong investment returns over the cycle and is focused exclusively on investments in growth stage technologydriven companies spanning multiple industries let me break down the results more specifically on our billion public equity portfolio we had gains of roughly million driven by market appreciation on investments including privia health knowbe4 and flywire we will continue to execute sales where possible as conditions permit across our billion private equity book we generated gains of billion from various positions more than twothirds of which were driven by events relating to the underlying portfolio companies including fundraisings capital market activities and outright sales significant transactions in the portfolio included investments in oncoclínicas a brazilian oncology business sterling a provider of screening solutions and zipwhip a messaging software firm additionally we had operating revenues of roughly million related to our portfolio of consolidated investment entities finally net revenues from lending and debt investment activities were million driven by nii and gains on fair value debt securities and loans these gains reflected modestly tighter credit spreads and idiosyncratic events on our portfolio of corporate and real estate investments on page we show the composition of our diversified asset management balance sheet consistent with the information that we have provided to you in prior quarters the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 staying with asset management let me turn to page we included this page in todays earnings presentation to provide greater detail on the progress made in harvesting our onbalance sheet investments in asset management over the first half of the year this is a critical driver of our strategy to reduce the capital intensity of our business the message on the page is simple while the overall balance sheet portfolio has increased modestly since the end of last year we have been actively harvesting positions through the outright sales and ipos of roughly billion these dispositions have been largely offset by markups on the portfolio of approximately billion given the supportive market backdrop mentioned as well as modest additions to the balance sheet which include early fund facilitation and other commitments so while the balance sheet is slightly higher we are actively executing on our harvesting strategy the implied capital associated with the total dispositions across both private and public equity positions yeartodate is approximately billion and at this stage we have line of sight on roughly billion of incremental private asset sales corresponding to over billion of capital reduction as noted earlier we will continue to pursue this disposition activity particularly given treatment of onbalance sheet equity investments under ccar moving to page consumer wealth management produced record revenues of billion in the second quarter wealth management revenues of billion included record management and other fees of billion as assets under supervision increased to billion private banking and lending revenues were million with loans to private wealth clients up billion sequentially consistent with our growth objectives we remain focused on synergies between our pfm and pwm franchises where we continue to see referrals representing a significant aus opportunity consumer banking revenues were million for the quarter reflecting higher deposit balances and credit card loans the lowrate environment as well as our reduced rate of loan growth in the portfolio over the past months continues to impact the business though forward growth should help to offset this next lets turn to page for our firmwide view of assets under supervision and management and other fees total aus increased to a record trillion during the quarter the sequential increase of billion was driven by billion of longterm inflows billion of liquidity inflows and billion of market appreciation our firm wide management and other fees grew by versus the second quarter of to a record billion on page we address net interest income and our lending portfolio across all segments total firmwide nii was billion for the second quarter higher versus a year ago reflecting lower funding expenses and an increase in interestearning assets next lets review loan growth and credit performance across the firm our total loan portfolio at quarter end was billion up billion sequentially driven by wealth management and residential real estate warehouse lending as well as apple card provision for credit losses reflected a net benefit of million which includes a reserve reduction driven by improvements in the broader economic backdrop partially offset by portfolio growth as the credit environment remains benign we expect loan growth to accelerate in coming quarters consistent with our strategy to increase lending and financing across the firm lets turn to expenses on page our total quarterly operating expenses were billion and our efficiency ratio for the quarter was reflecting the operating leverage in our business and our ability to exhibit expense discipline while investing for growth our ratio of compensation to revenues net of provisions remained flat at though compensation expense increased yearoveryear reflecting strong results in line with our payfor performance culture noncompensation expenses were down versus last year due to significantly lower litigation costs excluding the impact of litigation noncompensation was up approximately relative to top line growth of as the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 increases in transactionbased and technology expenses were partially offset by lower expenses related to investment entities we remain focused on the billion expense efficiency target announced at investor day as we noted at a recent industry conference we also see increased opportunity for further expense efficiencies beyond the medium term which permits us to fund investments in growth initiatives and in the talent of the firm our effective tax rate in the quarter was as noted previously we expect our tax rate under the current tax regime to be approximately and well monitor the impact of various proposals being made in the us on the federal and state level turning to our balance sheet and capital on slide on june we disclosed the federal reserves indicative stress capital buffer estimate for goldman sachs of which implies a common equity tier requirement of effective october as david mentioned we also announced an increase in our dividend to per share while our expectation of the federal reserves stress test results was for a more meaningful reduction in our scb the results only serve to reaffirm the importance of executing our strategy of reducing the capital intensity of our businesses in light of our most recent scb we recognize that our standardized cet1 ratio will remain elevated for this ccar cycle and achieving our target in the medium term by definition will be more challenging that said we continue to believe that the to cet1 target range provided at investor day is appropriate for our firm our capital management philosophy remains unchanged we prioritize deploying capital for our client franchise at attractive returns paying a dividend commensurate with our forward view on durability of earnings and then returning any excess to shareholders via share purchases in the quarter we returned a total of billion to shareholders including common stock repurchases of billion and approximately million in common stock dividends consistent with our capital management philosophy and in recognition of the accretive capital deployment opportunities across the firm we lowered our stock repurchases in the quarter our book value per share rose to a record up sequentially total assets ended the quarter at trillion higher versus last quarter we maintained high liquidity levels with our global core liquid assets averaging billion on the liability side our total deposits rose to billion up billion versus last quarter and our long term debt also rose by billion driven by billion of benchmark issuance let me just spend a moment on funding as we noted on our fixed income call in may our yeartodate benchmark issuance has exceeded maturities and redemptions for the year contrary to our intention at the start of the year but responsive to client demand and attractive return opportunities for the firm we expect to continue this issuance should more accretive opportunities requiring nonbank funding persist albeit at a more moderate pace than the billion issued in the first half nonetheless we remain focused on further diversification of our funding channels and opportunities for higher utilization of deposit funding globally to that end we recently completed a realignment of certain of our bank entities to facilitate more activity in the us bank bringing our banks to nearly of the firm wide balance sheet the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 in conclusion we delivered record revenues for the first half of the year reflecting the diversification and strength of our client franchise looking forward the overall opportunity set remains attractive across the firm given strategic progress and recent performance we are confident around our medium term return targets with a path to sustainable midteens returns as we continue to execute on our strategy with that well now open up the line for questions question and answer section operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of glenn schorr with evercore isi glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi hi thanks very much a quick followup you noted the record prime brokerage prime financing balances and curious if you could drill down a little bit on how much is environment and engagement of clients versus new clients and market share gains and while were on the topic id love to know if you have any thoughts following the archegos incident what has or do you expect to change in the industry as a result thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc thanks a lot glenn so on prime balances they have grown theyve grown kind of consistent with the broader strategy that we set up as to distinguish that growth between the environment and clients i would say its both i would say the environment obviously by virtue of balances accreting in this market that has grown balances and weve obviously seen opportunity to take on new clients and frankly speaking to be more profound with our existing ones but i would tell you that in the context of all of that and i mentioned this in the script theres a clear screen which looks at where we are pricing how we are structuring terms both around new entrants and equally around the back book of our prime balances and so were being rather judicious in the context of what we bring in to assure that this stays as accretive as we think it can become from a returns point of view but it is both environment and clients and our ambition is to take that share up but to do it in a rather prudent way on the part of your question relating to archegos look this has obviously gathered kind of an investigative purview from a number of geographies and across regulators kind of hard to predict exactly where that yields or what that yields i suspect that in the broad category of transparency and disclosure both of which we would be supportive of there will be moves by regulators to achieve that but very hard to say kind of as to where that all plays out as we said in our first quarter earnings call we aim to be a constructive participant in the kind of regulatory and industry change that will come about glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi okay appreciate that maybe just to follow up on stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 sure glenn schorr q analyst evercore isi two of the new business builds you mentioned the family card with apple im curious on in what customer segment youre going after with that maybe a bigger question on do you have any numbers for us in terms of accounts balances or new partners you want to talk about then maybe that same comment question for transaction banking clients deposits just tracking progress id appreciate it thanks stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure so progress on both fronts has been considerable i would say lets start with apple card the press around creating the family plan was frankly speaking to achieve a greater and more positive user experience so that people across the family were treated equally in the context of the underwriting broadly speaking i think that move will accelerate share but i think more importantly and its objective was to create just a better overall user experience on apple card generally i would tell you that while we pulled back in terms of rate of growth during the course of covid weve seen the credit profile of apple card customers to prove positive perhaps even more positive than we thought and weve now opened up the aperture and are now accelerating that rate of growth consistent with the tone of the consumer market that were seeing and i think theres more opportunities to be had with apple using the card as a medium for engagement with the client set so youll start to see forward growth and i suspect balances will be a fast follower from the increased in originations and underwriting in apple card and the family plan will only serve to help that in transaction banking that business continues to grow were upwards of now several hundred clients billion of deposits and perhaps most importantly when you look at that deposit base were starting to see an acceleration of operational deposits approaching and thats obviously the lynchpin to creating a deposit base that is more usable and more valuable to the firm i will tell you based on our opening expectations of that business we have had to put less rate on deposits to attract customers its turning out that the user interface and the engagement with the corporate client set just in terms of what were offering by way of experience and technology is proving to be the winning ticket and so as both david and i mentioned in the prepared remarks were going to start to see geographic expansion both to the uk and japan weve set ourselves up from a bank entity point of view to facilitate that kind of growth with licenses in a variety of jurisdictions and a reorganization of the banking entities and so i think that business will continue to play forward and perhaps whats most illustrative of that is just the power of the corporate franchise and the open doors that are there in the context of kind of the one gs mantra and the way in which were able to sellin through an existing client base operator your next question comes from the line of christian bolu with autonomous christian bolu q analyst autonomous research good morning david and stephen maybe just start off with the equity investments portfolio and thanks very much for the roll forward on slide i guess i have a twoparter on that slide its a highclass problem but you the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 sold out nearly billion in positions and you made basically no progress in reducing the equity investment portfolio so curious what else you can do to bring that portfolio down and then maybe more broadly is it time to really rethink the sort of disposition strategy your stock is at alltime high the market is rewarding your stock for strong revenue growth and roe expansion and they dont really care about capital position so i mean should you just not just cut the buyback focus on revenue growth rather than potentially making on economic investment dispositions david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc so thanks christian we appreciate the question and on the first part of the question we absolutely have made progress on our goals with respect to capital efficiency and the onbalance sheet investing and ill let stephen highlight some of the details in the moment at the moment but we continue to move aggressively to manage those positions i think its a very constructive environment for us to do so and i think youll continue to do that youll continue to see us do that with intensity as we see good opportunities to monetize those positions we continue to be committed to both diversifying our revenue streams and also continuing to drive toward more durable and recurring revenues and the feebased emphasis of the fundraising that were doing in the asset management business is one aspect of that on the broader question about opportunity i think one of the reasons why we decreased our buyback in the quarter is that we see opportunities to continue to devote capital to serving our clients and growing our business and so if we can add accretive returns in our business by deploying capital in that manner well continue to do it but we want to remain and i think weve always been a very very nimble capital allocator and so when we see those opportunities we will make investments and well continue to grow the business if for some reason the environment changes and we dont well return that capital appropriately to shareholders stephen you want to comment just on the progress along those selldowns because we have made real targeted progress and well continue to make progress with respect to some of the goals weve set out stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so i guess lets just start kind of with the facts obviously on the new page that we showed you billion did come off balance sheet producing billion of capital relief and as i mentioned theres another billion thats in sight to take billion of capital down now that just looks narrowly speaking at the private equity portfolio theres consolidated investment entities there are debt positions all of which are on balance sheet all of which are subject to further reduction all of which will reduce down capital now why does that matter and why we want to stick to that strategy christian as opposed to kind of abandon it well first of all obviously were looking to elevate the capital returns of the firm the one way to do that is to influence the denominator the way to do that is to reduce down the capital density of our businesses more broadly at the same time this is going to dramatically change over time the durable revenue forecast for the firm which is that moving from onbalance sheet to fund format and the fact that weve raised since investor day billion of new funds in those funds okay well increase assets under supervision and equally will increase fee revenue thats being generated by those investments in that fund format and so in a way the page to watch on the forward will be page of our investor day presentation because whats going to play out and we promised more disclosure which we will deliver but firmwide assets under supervision will go up firmwide management and other fees will go up those will prove to be more durable and the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 predictable and i think hold the promise of greater valuation on the back of a lower capital dense set of businesses and i think thats the broader picture if you will in terms of what were trying to achieve what we put on page was nothing but an attempt very simply to show progress was made much as it would otherwise be masked by as you put it kind of a very happy problem in terms of an appreciating equity market also providing us with an opportunity to accelerate into the strategy of disposing of onbalance sheet investments operator your next question comes from the line of steven chubak with wolfe research steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning steve stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc good morning steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc so wanted to start off with a question just on the investment banking outlook first half revenue is a record you cited the record backlog were clearly seeing continued strong share gains one of the interesting metrics i was provided recently by john at a recent conference was that you saw a billion benefit just from share gains in global markets and just given some of the momentum in the investment banking side i didnt know if you could help frame how much of a revenue benefit youve seen from those share gains and is there any risk to any sort of disruption in the current environment especially given the biden executive order that was recently published david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure so a couple of thoughts on that broadly i mean the environment for investment banking activity steven continues to be very very constructive and i think that theres a good chance that that will continue to play forward in that direction for some time here as the economic expansion continues in my remarks i highlighted the fact that coming out of the pandemic there were a handful of factors that we think are structurally driving ceos and boards to think about how they can strategically strengthen their position in an increasingly evolving digital world and were seeing really really broad engagement across our franchise with respect to the desire of companies to better position themselves on a go forward basis in a world thats actually evolving quite quickly im encouraged by the fact that our backlog levels remain extremely high record levels and a lot of that i think feels like it will sustain as we move through this environment obviously if there was some sort of a disruption or an economic slowdown sometime in the future that would wear on confidence and slow that but that doesnt seem likely given where we are positioned today the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 with respect to global markets we picked up basis points of market share through quarter one and thats allowing us to take greater share of whatever the broader trading market provides us i dont have specific market share kpis on investment banking to share right on this call we can certainly followup more broadly on some things obviously we tracked our we track our league table position both in ma and equity and debt and there weve been strengthening our position over time and its consistently at the top of those league tables what i do say is affecting our wallet share in banking is part of our investor day process to serve a broader array of clients was to really expand that footprint and the footprint of available clients that lets say are in the million to billion enterprise value has been significant its grown and weve continued to expand that footprint and were quite effective at penetrating that and so thats been a very good opportunity for us and i actually think that opportunity will continue i think our investment banking business is positioned incredibly well i think we continue as we have been to be a leader in that business over the course of the last decades and the quality of the talent we have in that business continues to be strong differentiated and very very front footed with our clients and so there certainly could be macro events over 36month period that slow down the current momentum but at the moment it feels quite constructive steven chubak q analyst wolfe research llc no thanks for all that color david and just for my followup relating to a line of questioning tied to christians question just on the equity investment portfolio recognizing that barring a net reduction in that portfolio understanding theres other metrics we have to monitor it might be difficult to really see any meaningful scb improvement at least in the near term i was hoping to get some perspective just given the multiple rerating that youve seen the strong momentum in the business as well as the fact that scb is feeling some upward pressure whether your views on transformational ma are evolving at all and whether a potential acquisition could at least help potentially mitigate some of the pressures from the global market shock that seem to be driving that upward pressure on the capital ratio david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc at a high level and i appreciate the question steve i dont think our views on transformational ma have evolved call after call quarterafterquarter ive said and ill say again that the bar would always be extremely high for us to do something very very significant but ive also said that our drive to diversify our revenues and create more durable revenues comes as both stephen and i have highlighted in our remarks from continuing to invest in and grow our asset management business continuing to invest in and grow the opportunity in our wealth management business and for broadening our digital consumer banking platform there may be opportunities from time to time that can accelerate the direction of travel on those we look at things constantly if we see things that can accelerate the direction of travel in those businesses and accelerate our goals in those businesses well certainly consider them always with a high bar it wouldnt surprise you that prices at the moment are high and that certainly has an impact on how we think about these things but were making a lot of progress organically and we continue to be focused on that organic growth operator your next question comes from the line of betsy graseck with morgan stanley the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc hi good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc just as a incremental followup on everything you just said david how do we think about the sizing of the equity investment book that youre looking for i totally get that markups are adding to this right now but the billion in addition theres lots of great opportunities out there should we expect that over time the equity investments book should be rising or is there a goal of size of this portfolio that youre looking to manage to over the next call it two to three years david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well the strategy has been to take a broad asset management business and particularly around alternatives that has been extremely balance sheet heavy and turn it into more of a fundbased model and weve only started to really tap into the relationship network and the platform that we have as a firm to really be a much bigger institutional capital manager across these strategies broadly and as stephen highlighted since our investor day weve raised billion in fund structure i think everybody on this call understands that when we do raise funds we invest as a gp alongside our institutional investors and so there will always be equity investment through our fund participation but the cycle that were going through is one of shifting from significant onbalance sheet investments over time to a much broader fund mix where the investment slice we have in the fund is smaller and therefore the overall equity position will be meaningfully smaller than its been now its a good problem that the market keeps going up and therefore the value seems to be staying the same even though were making very very significant sales but over time as we continue to grow the funds portion of the business and we continue on the path of disposing that number will get smaller we havent put out a target number but by definition it will get smaller in the nearterm our balance sheet will come down and our ae target is a little less than billion stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc the only other thing i would add to that betsy is that if you look at page in the presentation on the lefthand side you can see weve been talking a lot about the billion of equity investments but equally consolidated investment entities of billion is fertile ground to continue to bring this down and reduce down the ae in the segment and so all of that is part and parcel of where we want to go obviously the objective or the nearterm target as it were of ae of getting down to billion or lower remains that and were committed to get to it notwithstanding the appreciation in the overall portfolio because as you rightly point out that also presents opportunity to accelerate where we can the selldown of these positions the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc right because i should be thinking about the billion in terms of density of capital usage kind of the old methodology stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc correct betsy l graseck q analyst morgan stanley co llc when you were invested in these funds to new which is more like three or less percent invested in the fund so obviously the latter is less capitalintensive i guess the other question is in addition to page lefthand side that you mentioned are there other things we should be thinking about for bringing the scb down or would you say hey look page lefthand side thats really the bulk of the actions that we are interested in taking stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well look i think the way to think about this is that were not waiting for the fed to deliver us a result thats satisfactory okay much as were petitioning them on some issues that are relevant were taking a lot of selfhelp here weve been talking about one the overall push to durable revenues right is going to factor in to the way in which the fed determines ppnr in the context of the overall scb calculation so its not just limited to this it means what do we do in the pivot to the fees that will be generated as david spoke about and i did of billion and growing in fund format what does it mean in the context of a growing consumer business what does it mean in the context of a growing fee set that comes out of transaction banking all of these will prove to be more durable viewed that way presumably by the fed to yield a better ppnr sort of calculation in the overall test so were not exclusively relying on this much as this has sort of considerable consequence in the way in which ccar treats onbalance sheet investing and then again we remain quite engaged with the fed as we put our letter in last year and well only serve to reinforce those issues this year on issues that we think are relevant to achieving a lower scb calculation operator your next question comes from the line of brennan hawken with ubs brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc good morning thanks for taking my questions wanted to ask about ma the advisory business in banking and steven touched on this but maybe i wanted to be a bit more explicit so weve seen a bit more hawkishness on the antitrust side not only with the recent executive order but also with some of the actions tied to certain deals what kind of an impact do you expect this might happen have on volumes and velocity in the ma market broadly and i believe you touched on the fact that sponsor activity was a big has been a big contributor to ma volume how much of that sponsor activity do you get the sense is driven by some kind of tax motivation given all the talk about the potential for rising taxes thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 sure im going to answer the second part first and then ill circle back on the executive order and kind of the broader roadmap around ma but i dont think the sponsor activity is driven by tax the sponsor business at this point is a broad diverse business theres enormous dry powder there is an enormous amount of money that moves in that ecosystem theres real secular growth in the context of the capital allocators and their desire to increase their weighting to alternatives its one of the reasons why the strategy were focused as one of the leading alternative managers in the world and continuing to grow that because theres lots of demand for our clients and so i dont think that theres any overlay from a tax perspective thats accelerating activity there i do think that activity has accelerated because the market environment is quite constructive and its been quite a constructive environment for asset prices generally with respect to the broad ma environment and antitrust and the executive order i mean obviously the executive order i think serves as the roadmap for a whole bunch of policy priorities that the current administration would like to get done over the next four years that relate broadly to competition consumer protection issues its a broad and ambitious range of ideas its something that i think well have to watch very very closely ultimately the order cant direct the agencies that make the antitrust decisions to make those decisions but it can put a set of constructs into place that certainly could ultimately have a regulatory impact but the agencies will have to over time put forward or through the actions they take create more transparency on that well be watching it very closely and doing a lot of work to see how that all evolves with agencies certainly i think theres a tipping in the balance that could in the margin have some impact on certain transactions id certainly say broadly around large tech consolidation therell certainly be a lot of discussion in that area but i think its early and i think you have to watch it closely and i think the macro environment and the tailwinds from the macro environment and some of the things i said earlier about companies desires to really strengthen their competitive positioning outweighs the regulatory overlay but were going to have to watch that very carefully brennan hawken q analyst ubs securities llc great thanks for that color david and then for my second question theres been a lot of press coverage recently around junior banking junior banker frustration and weve seen some competitors increase comp for the junior levels as a result do you think any of those developments will impact retention at goldman and do you have any specific plans or intentions to respond to this development yourselves and what kind of impact do you think that might have thanks david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc sure brennan i appreciate the question and as weve highlighted earlier in the call were quite proud of our leading investment banking franchise its been a leading franchise for decades and i think one of the primary reasons its been a leading franchise is because of the quality of the people that were able to attract and retain at goldman sachs who serve our clients and serve our clients extraordinarily well we have always paid very competitively weve always been a payforperformance organization we are performing we have a normal pay cycle for analysts that normal pay cycle happens to be in august and well continue to pay competitively and pay for performance but thats part of our strategy thats been in place for a long time and it will obviously continue with respect to salaries we evaluate salaries in regular course every single year and when appropriate we make sure our salaries are competitive so we continue to thrive by having the best people here and paying them the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 appropriately especially when we perform were performing and i would tell you to expect to see us pay appropriately during our normal cycle operator your next question comes from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hey mike david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc so look it looks like revenues and profits per employee are up over the last year last five years even while youve grown employees what yearoveryear and over five years so i think what would be sustainable is if youre lowering unit costs and generating revenues for lower marginal costs so my question is how much has technology helped you to lower unit cost and how much more is ahead and from the outside theres no way we can compute that you have private equity gains you have a lot of moving parts but on the inside of the firm i imagine you are tracking this in some manner david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc ill start and stephen will add mike but at a high level and weve talked about this weve talked about efficiency in the firm weve talked about digitization weve talked about connectivity to our clients and ways that technology can leverage our ability to serve our clients all of that continues and theres a significant investment going into that making the firm more efficient but most importantly levering our peoples capabilities to better serve our clients i think that we are in the third inning of that evolution there is more opportunity but there have been some real gains and stephen can probably quantify on some basis how we think about that but i think theres a lot more opportunity for us to continue through digitization and the way we connect with our clients and the tools we use to create more leverage broadly and so we continue to be focused on that stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah mike the way we look at it and compute it is we look at the introduction of technology into a variety of different work streams take risk for example where theres mandatory production of tens of thousands of reports either by regulators or consumption internally and we go through a zerobased budgeting exercise where we constantly revisit what we need in the context of the introduction of technology and automation that plays forward the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 when i think about the forward for the firm the real cost gains are going to happen and the production of higher marginal margins are going to play out by virtue of the achievement of scale when we achieve scale in certain of these businesses take transaction banking take the consumer business even look at what we do in platforms like pfm okay we are building constantly higher marginal margin returns because weve got an embedded base that is built to scale and those businesses will scale over time over the medium to longterm and the effective unit cost if you will of producing what we do will come down and so thats just a sense both in the spot zerobased budgeting risk et cetera but equally on the forward in terms of how to think about the achievement of scale and higher marginal margin in the business mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc and as it relates to the executive order from the white house with you guys positioned as a potential disruptor in the consumer business what do you make and what are the possibilities for you to benefit from making it easier to transport customer data from bank to bank stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well i would say a couple of things i mean one is to repeat what david said which is its a bit early right now a week into the issuance of the executive order as to exactly how that plays okay from our perspective we started this consumer business on a white sheet of paper so were not retrofitting a series of transactions or incumbent businesses and so as we look to continue to build the consumer platform were quite open to the notion that there will be shared set of data the data will be portable our focus has been entirely from the customer back which is what does the customer want what does the customer need and the build of a very differentiated new consumer platform and so these products are all about the design utilization of data we obviously are consistent and in line with some of our other banking brethren which is we need to make sure that the security of customer data is paramount were no different than any other bank we take that responsibility seriously but i think on the new build on a white sheet of paper were less burdened by these issues less protective of an incumbent business and more focused on where we can take it and where we can build david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah the only thing id add to that mike is that when we started building this business four or five years ago it certainly was in our vision of the world that customers would have a lot more flexibility to move their data and attach to different platforms and so certainly in our macro design of where we think the world is going the direction of travel that way is not something thats surprising to us operator your next question comes from the line of dan fannon with jefferies daniel t fannon q analyst jefferies llc thanks good morning was hoping to get a bit of an update on the expense efficiency initiatives that youve laid out and kind of where the progress sits today and the break out of kind of noncomp versus comp on a go forward basis and then secondly if you could also update us on the funding optimization goals that you have i think the goal of basis point improvement over time can you update us on where that sits today the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yes sure okay so let me take the three pieces first on the billion expense initiative we are as ever confident in the achievement of that and you all may have heard at a recent industry conference john waldron indicated that we have further confidence to about million above and beyond that to be achieved outside the time line that we set for the achievement of the billion so confident in the existing number and giving an offering kind of a forward indication of where we can take it up from there again all of this consistent actually with some of the prior questions are about creating capacity for further investment in the firm and in its people and so thats where we stand as it relates to the expense initiatives in terms of comp and noncomp and the forward let me say this on compensation as david has indicated weve always been in a payforperformance mode well continue to be that as the firm performs we will continue to sort of pay out to both attract and retain talent i will say as weve said in the past on compensation that the compensation as sort of a call out component to operating expense will become less and less important as and to the extent that we build out more of these scaled businesses and so therefore youll be looking more at operating expense in its total than you will as we have historically been rather preoccupied with the compensation ratio in and of itself thats less a reflection of any departure whatsoever from the way in which we want to pay talent it has more to do with the composition of businesses that were building and the kind of noncomp intensity of expenses related to it on noncomp expense i would say we have in virtually every one of the recent quarters been quite focused on ensuring that we demonstrate operating leverage in the business that is our noncomp expense normalized for kind of excessive oneoff litigation or the like trends at a level which is inside rate of growth to the top line of the firm so this quarter as i noted while the asreported noncomp expense is down about thats influenced very heavily by the billion of litigation that appeared in the second quarter of last year when you look at it likeforlike our noncomp expense is up against the top line revenue growth i think that should be a guidepost for how were going to continue to sort of carry ourselves on the forward on the third question you asked about funding optimization here i would say we are we remain committed and confident in the achievement of billion in funding optimization bear in mind that as i spoke about increased nondeposit fundings or increased wholesale funding the overall funding mix or the funding taken in total for the firm is going up its going up in the context of accretive opportunities we see inside the firm in as much as we grow nonbank or wholesale funding we are equally growing the deposit base were doing that now at a lower price point than where we were before its indicative of nii growing in the firm and so were confident that the growth in that deposit funding on a price times volume basis is going to continue to sort of bear fruit and take us to billion of run rate savings within the timeframe operator your next question comes from the line of devin ryan with jmp securities devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc great good morning david and stephen stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc hey devin the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc wanted to quickly follow up on transaction banking and just trying to better understand some of the traction just given such strong growth in the quarter and what id like to dig in a little bit is around the clients that you mentioned do you have any just kind of the wallet share that youre seeing and what im getting at is are clients i guess currently just testing your platform and so theres kind of maybe significant embedded potential as those clients move more balances over so any flavor for that and then it seems like success is going to be getting more success here as proofofconcept has obviously been established and so just any other color on kind of what youre seeing in the sales process and whether theres an acceleration in bringing customers on now that its fully established stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure devin so i would say the process of sellthrough here is better in terms of rate of growth than we anticipated but the way in which its happening is as we anticipated which is that we are not new to any one of the corporates who are coming on to this platform theres a longstanding corporate relationship that has opened the door we had said from the beginning that while our ambition was to grow a very big and very profitable business we recognized that there was a progression we have large corporates that have a platform of three or four participating banks that our break in point was to be number three or four and this wasnt conditioned on us jumping to the number one spot on that platform out of the box now my view is that as treasurers and cfos grow ever more confident in kind of their operational experience on the platform we will grow we will have more products and services to offer that corporate client off of the transaction banking platform and we will see our ranking if you will on that platform grow if we began at or well see ourselves to and perhaps and that will continue to sort of grow and expand but these are formidable clients of the firm who place considerable confidence in the firm so that sellthrough is as we expected perhaps faster in terms of rate of growth and thats kind of progression i would also say that that will correspondingly lead to greater operational deposits on the billion growing that we will see because as a client becomes ever more operational as a percentage of their overall business percentage of their deposits with the firm will become more operational therefore more valuable and so that i think is kind of the progression and the way to think about growth and the migration kind of up the ladder as it were for any given corporate client devin ryan q analyst jmp securities llc okay very helpful ill leave it there thank you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 operator your next question comes from the line of ebrahim poonawala with bank of america ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc i guess i just wanted to follow up on your outlook around your midteens roe target youve talked david a lot about the revenue durability and reducing the capital density both of which should eventually be accretive to the roe profile but when you look at how the market values the stock today i think theres some skepticism around where the roe could be if theres a downturn in the cycle just talk to us if you could in your view where do you think the firm is overearning versus underearning from an roe standpoint and whats the netnet outcome of those two david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc well i think broadly speaking were performing very well across a very very diverse platform of businesses certainly i cant predict the future there certainly could be an environment that comes in the future where economic activity slows and where some parts of our business slow visàvis the levels of activity were seeing today on the other hand at times of stress or in times of decreasing economic activity there are also parts of our business that perform quite well and have some counter cyclicality so i think we have a big atscale business we are at scale in a number of our businesses and a leader i think those businesses will continue through the cycle to produce very very good returns i think were building other businesses that as stephen highlighted are going to be scaling some of them are different kinds of businesses but they offer opportunity for more consistent modellable more consistent returns that you can more easily model and people will view as more durable i believe that our business activities are durable through the cycle and our job is to continue to perform and continue to prove it and so i believe if we continue to do that over time the discount that exists between the way our earnings are valued and the way others and our peers are valued should narrow but were going to continue to focus on serving our clients growing these businesses expanding the platforms and my belief is the market will follow stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc i mean to some extent if you reflect on davids comments roe is nothing but numerator over denominator and so were controlling both revenue intake and expense in the context of the numerator and equally working hard to do what we can of our own volition to reduce down the denominator in the context of scb but the reality is we sit the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 where we sit were changing kind of the dynamic of the business profile all to yield a higher roe which will translate as david suggested into the potential for a much better look at the valuation of the firm overall david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc yeah and id just add broadly the kind of environment that obviously affects our returns certainly when you look historically its affected other of our peer institutions returns too there are differences in our business but i dont think they are as different as theyre amplified from timetotime ebrahim h poonawala q analyst bofa securities inc got it and just as a followup on the consumer strategy can you achieve significant scale over the next few years without doing something inorganic or do you think you can build out without having to do any meaningful ma and still create a sizable business in a reasonable timeframe david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc we absolutely think that we can build an atscale business over the course of the next three to five years without doing something inorganic if we saw something that we thought could accelerate that or enhance that wed certainly consider it but we have a detailed plan that gives us what we think is a scalable which is an atscale significant business over the next five years and were going to continue to invest and continue to execute against it and as we said a number of times those investments and that drive to do that is not affecting our either mid or slightly longerterm return targets and thresholds that we continue to drive towards operator your next question comes from the line of matt oconnor with deutsche bank matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank good morning stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank so theres been an acceleration of the electronification of ficc there was a good article i think over the weekend on this specifically within credit and i was wondering if you could talk a bit about this and i know youve invested a lot on the technology side on both sides of trading but how does this kind of shape up for you in terms of thinking about your share going forward assuming this trend continues the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc so in the context of our credit business in ficc this has been an area of considerable investment from a technology point of view because we needed to and wanted to migrate from what was kind of high touch to low touch and pick up high volume lowermargin business and so portfolio trading algos the introduction of them the development of digital platforms where asset managers insurance companies can come and execute on those platforms using marquee has been a very very significant and somewhat elevated prospect for us in terms of overall performance its also enabling us to develop new products in credit like customized baskets and trs strategies its all in the context of where a client of the firm can come either through marquee or otherwise and through an api use data and tools that the firm is providing in order to execute and that is a growing piece of the overall credit business in ficc and an area where we think that there is enormous opportunity for us to continue to grow and so were seeing monthly users around marquee accelerate api interaction accelerate all in the context of kind of the underlying premise to your question matt oconnor q analyst deutsche bank and then just followingup on ficc i know its always annoying when you get asked about like nearterm trends but weve seen some unusual activity in rates the last month with the move down especially in the longer end weve seen some correction in certain areas of commodities has this caused clients to reposition like change views and driving more activity or are most clients views thinking specifically on rates i guess that its more temporary and not doing a lot of repositioning with the move weve had stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well i think volume intake in ph erp has been reasonably volatile meaning weve seen around certain rate crosscurrents and the overall debate around inflation permanent or transitory is expressing itself in increased client activity in ph erp and then moments of more muted activity so ph erp has been in both places over the last several months in the commodities business i would say that we have broadly expanded our business to take account of greater product dispersion in commodities to play to a greater interest of expression in view by clients so for example our business used to be in commodities almost oil and now oil is more like and we see greater product dispersion across gas power metals and ags i think thats good for our business and it reflects our reaction to as i say an expression by clients and customers of greater interest across a wider sort of span of product sets within commodities itself operator your next question comes from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc thank you good morning david good morning stephen the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc good morning david michael solomon a chairman chief executive officer the goldman sachs group inc good morning gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc stephen you touched on in your opening prepared remarks about youre positioned well for loan growth accelerating going forward can you give us some additional color on where you see this loan growth materializing possibly over the next to months stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc yeah so let me talk a little bit about where weve seen loan growth now because i think its reflective of the forward so as i mentioned in my remarks were seeing loan growth in our pwm client channel where we extended about billion of incremental lending in the quarter its a great feeder in the context of our engagement with clients and kind of a broader fee pool thats created by virtue of meeting the borrowings and this is all very well credit placed in the context of the client set thats borrowing weve seen more lending in the context of our investment banking business much of that relating to transactional activity again it bleeds out to a larger fee pool in the context of where we are in global markets weve seen ourselves and i mentioned this in mortgages around warehouse financing so this is very liquid lending that i think takes on the proper credit profile in terms of whats there so the positioning im speaking about is both a broader view about macro risk about individual idiosyncratic risk in the sleeve in which were lending and perhaps more importantly the returns that the firm takes in in the context of lending into any one of those particular client segments gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good and then as a followup question youve all seen and weve all seen that the reverse repo market has grown dramatically since the first of the year in fact in the last three to four months the fed in fact raised the rate that they pay on those reverse repos by up to basis points can you guys share with us your insights what the implications are of whats going on in the plumbing if you will of the financial system here in the states with quantitative easing the reverse repos and how that might be affecting or impacting favorably your trading businesses stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well look any time there is kind of a differentiated view on rates or the markets broadly as david mentioned that tends to bleed to a positive outcome for our business more broadly in global markets meaning to the extent that theres greater volatility greater activity at wider bid offer spreads its a positive outcome in the overall performance of our business hard for me to give you specific judgments on whats happening specifically as it the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 relates to the transmission of whats going on in trs relating to the revenue in the business itself but i would say that it portends a positive for our business in the context of overall client activity operator your next question comes from the line of jim mitchell with seaport research james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc hey good morning maybe just a question on capital management from here and how we should think about pace of buybacks et cetera you guys have about basis point cushion over your scb i guess basis points in the slr can you maybe just refresh us on what your management buffers youre targeting how to think about the dynamic going forward between just balance sheet growth loan growth versus what youre trying to do on the buyback side stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure so first on scb and slr scb is more binding to us than slr we dont view slr as being a binding constraint much as we obviously watch it and maintain an adequate buffer around it but scb is more binding than slr as it relates to scb we have long said that we maintain a to basis point buffer management buffer above our minimum i see no reason to sort of change that view we do view that buffer not simply as a defensive tool but rather an offensive tool where it leaves us with considerable dry powder in the deployment of capital when and if clients look to petition us for it actually during the second quarter that was true we participated in att and medline both of which were momentarily capital consumptive the buffer enabled us to do that and engage just one obviously factual point which is were at under scb for this the third quarter we go down to in the fourth quarter relative to the most recent ccar outcome as it relates to share repurchase i would only say what i said before which is weve obviously taken the dividend up reflective of our view about the forward durability of the performance of the firm and we look to deploy capital at returns and if they continue to demonstrate mid20 return on equity you will see us continue to deploy capital in that direction to the extent that that falls off for whatever reason we will take up our share repurchase in that regard but you should assume us to be an active participant in share repurchase in any given quarter this is really a question of whether it moves up or down and thats a function of the kind of return opportunities that we see james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc so youre i mean just so we have a good understanding its just saying its going to be pretty dynamic quarter toquarter in terms of what pace of buybacks if you see an opportunity youll do it and viceversa stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc thats precisely right yes james mitchell q analyst seaport global securities llc the goldman sachs group inc gs corrected transcript q2 earnings call 13jul2021 okay great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of jeremy sigee with exane jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas thank you good morning just one quick followup please you talked about regulatory investigations around archegos you said its too early to know the outcome but are you seeing other firms pulling back in prime or in equities more broadly as a consequence of the archegos situation is that any part of the market share gains that youve been seeing stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc well hard to tie point a to point b but youve obviously seen open expressions by other firms who are looking to reduce down their prime business were going the other way we want to grow that business but as i say were growing that business with every element of prudence as to pricing and term structure and the like but i suspect clients in motion around prime are coming to goldman sachs as they are to others and we are looking to sort of grow that business more broadly jeremy sigee q analyst exane bnp paribas okay thank you stephen m scherr a chief financial officer executive vice president the goldman sachs group inc sure operator
