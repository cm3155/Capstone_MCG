strong quarter generating billion of net income or per share the combination of continued growth in our commercial and the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 consumer loan books and higher rates drove net interest income higher and our net interest margin increased basis points by the way thats the largest sequential increase in nim in more than a decade noninterest income was also up modestly reflecting strong private equity performance and a record quarter in loan syndications partially offset by weaker ma activity we remained disciplined on the expense front resulting in percentage points of positive operating leverage our credit quality was largely unchanged in the quarter while we have not seen a meaningful deterioration in credit quality taking place our provision of million reflects our slightly weaker economic expectations our capital levels remained solid and we returned billion of capital to shareholders during the quarter through share repurchases and dividends we continue to make good progress on our strategic priorities our new and acquired markets performed particularly well across all lines of business and we see significant untapped opportunities across these markets we also continue to invest in our payments capabilities to provide differentiated value we recently acquired linga enhancing our capabilities to better serve restaurant and retail clients particularly in the small business space and during the quarter we made enhancements across our retail platform to drive customer convenience and retention for example we recently announced a partnership with allpoint to give our customers surchargefree access to additional atms from coast to coast with this partnership pnc now offers customers surchargefree access to more than pnc and partner atms across the country in amg we saw positive quarterly flows of billion driven by both the private bank and institutional asset management we are recruiting top talent and remain focused on taking share in all of our markets in summary in the third quarter we executed well as a national main street bank and we are in a position of strength as we look to the future as always i want to thank our employees for their hard work in the third quarter and for everything they do to deliver for our customers communities and our shareholders and with that ill turn it over to rob to provide more detail about our financial results robert q reilly chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thanks bill and good morning everyone our balance sheet is on slide and is presented on an average basis during the quarter loan balances were billion an increase of billion or investment securities grew approximately billion or cash balances at the federal reserve decreased billion and our deposit balances averaged billion a decline of billion or however spot deposits were down billion or less than as lower consumer deposits were partially offset by growth in commercial deposits at the end of the third quarter our loantodeposit ratio was and remains well below our prepandemic levels average borrowed funds increased billion as we bolstered our liquidity through federal home loan bank borrowings during the quarter we increased our borrowings with the home loan bank by billion on a spot basis the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 we continue to be well positioned with significant capital flexibility during the quarter we returned billion of capital to shareholders through approximately million of common dividends and billion of share repurchases or million shares and as of september our cet1 ratio was estimated to be slide shows our loans in more detail during the third quarter we delivered solid loan growth across our expanded franchise loan balances averaged billion an increase of billion or compared to the second quarter reflecting growth in both commercial and consumer loans on a spot basis loans grew billion or commercial loans grew billion as strong new production more than offset the syndication of the billion of high quality shortterm loans that were expected to mature in the second half of the year consumer loans increased billion driven by higher residential mortgage and home equity balances partially offset by lower auto loans and loan yields increased basis points compared to the second quarter driven by higher interest rates slide covers our deposits in more detail although average deposits declined billion or compared to the second quarter spot deposits were billion and declined less than compared to june commercial deposits grew billion or on a spot basis and consumer deposits declined billion or reflecting inflationary pressures and seasonally higher spending given the rising interest rate environment weve begun to see a mix shift from noninterestbearing into interest bearing particularly within our commercial deposits and expect this to continue over time however to date our consolidated deposit portfolio mix has remained relatively stable with twothirds interestbearing and onethird noninterestbearing overall our rate paid on interestbearing deposits increased basis points linkedquarter to basis points as of september our cumulative beta was and we estimate it will increase to approximately by yearend slide details our securities portfolio on an average basis our securities grew billion or during the quarter as we replaced maturities with higheryielding securities the yield on our securities portfolio increased basis points to driven by higher reinvestment yields as well as lower premium amortization and during the quarter new purchase yields exceeded throughout the course of the year weve repositioned our securities portfolio and as of september we had of our securities classified as heldtomaturity while interest rates have continued to increase this repositioning has reduced the rate of change in our aoci at the end of the third quarter our accumulated other comprehensive loss was billion and as you know is not included in our regulatory capital and importantly we expect this amount to fully accrete back over the remaining lives of the securities and swaps as of september we estimate that approximately of aoci will accrete back per quarter going forward turning to the income statement on slide as you can see third quarter reported net income was billion or per share revenue was up million or compared with the second quarter expenses increased million or resulting in positive operating leverage linkedquarter provision was million in the third quarter reflecting a slightly weaker economic outlook which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings and our effective tax rate was the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 turning to slide we highlight our revenue trends as you can see total revenue for the third quarter was billion an increase of or million linkedquarter net interest income of billion was up million or the benefit of higher yields on interestearning assets and increased loan balances was partially offset by higher funding costs and as a result net interest margin increased basis points to third quarter noninterest income of billion increased million as lower fee income was offset by an increase in other noninterest income the decline in fee revenue was driven by lower activity in our capital markets mortgage and asset management businesses which was somewhat offset by continued strong performance in our lending and deposit services as well as our card and cash management fees growth in other noninterest income reflected higher private equity revenue as well as a million positive visa derivative fair value adjustment in the third quarter compared to a negative adjustment of million in the second quarter turning to slide our third quarter expenses continue to be well managed and were up linkedquarter the growth reflected increased personnel expense to support business growth as well as one additional day in the quarter as we previously stated we have a goal to reduce costs by million in through our continuous improvement program were now nine months into the year and weve completed actions related to capturing more than of our annual goal and as a result we remain confident we will achieve our full year objectives as you know this program funds a significant portion of our ongoing business and technology investments our credit metrics are presented on slide nonperforming loans of billion increased million or compared to june 30th and continue to represent less than of total loans total delinquencies were billion on september 30th at million or increase linkedquarter the increase was driven by elevated levels of administrative delinquencies the majority of which have already been or are in the process of being resolved net chargeoffs for loans and leases were million an increase of million linkedquarter primarily driven by higher commercial loan net chargeoffs our annualized net chargeoffs to average loans continues to be historically low at basis points provision for the third quarter was million compared to million in the second quarter the increase reflected slightly weaker economic expectations which impacted our macroeconomic scenarios and weightings and during the third quarter our allowance for credit losses remained essentially stable our reserves now total billion and continue to be of total loans in summary pnc reported a strong third quarter in regard to our view of the overall economy we expect moderate growth in the fourth quarter resulting in gdp growth for the full year we also expect the fed to raise rates by an additional basis points in the fourth quarter with a 75basis point increase in november and a 50basis point increase in december looking at the fourth quarter of compared to the third quarter of we expect average loan balances to increase approximately net interest income to be up to fee income to be stable to down other noninterest income to be between million and million excluding net securities and visa activity taking our guidance for all components of revenue into consideration we expect total revenue to increase approximately we expect total noninterest expense to be stable to up fourth quarter net chargeoffs to be between million and million and we expect our effective tax rate to be approximately and with that bill and i are ready to take your questions the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 question and answer section operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from the line of john pancari with evercore please go ahead john pancari q analyst evercore group llc good morning robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey john john pancari q analyst evercore group llc hey on the funding side i know you saw your deposit balances pull back again on a linkedquarter basis in both average and eop wonder if you can give us a little bit of color on your thoughts there on deposit growth in coming quarters as rates continue to rise and you see some mix in your funding thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey john good morning its rob yeah so on deposits we saw a decline in the quarter less so on a spot basis actually commercial deposits grew there at the end of the quarter but down quarteroverquarter when we look forward to the next quarter we sort of see stable to down on the consumer side we do expect some downward trends just reflecting what weve seen lately which is largely spend related somewhat seasonal but also the inflationary pressures and then on the commercial side were calling it stable now typically seasonally we see commercial increase and so far in the quarter we have seen increases but theres a lot of forces working against that with quantitative tightening and everything thats going on so were calling for stable overall down maybe a little bit john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay thats helpful and related to that rob can you just maybe update us on how youre thinking about deposit betas in terms of your net interest income expectations and how youre thinking about the margin thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure sure so as i mentioned in my prepared remarks our betas are running right now at around we expect it to go to by yearend john pancari q analyst evercore group llc right okay and then in terms of the margin trajectory just see if you can help us with we should think about that as well the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well i think in terms of the margin we saw a nice increase obviously in the third quarter we wont see that equivalent jump necessarily in the fourth quarter but as the fed continues to raise rates we would continue to see some margin expansion john pancari q analyst evercore group llc okay and then if i could just ask one more on the buybacks billion for the quarter came in above your million guidance maybe if you could just talk about expectations the likelihood of it being million for next quarter or could you surpass that again if you have the opportunity given the share price thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah so we have been active repurchasers of our shares weve been operating under the stress capital buffer framework which allows us a lot of flexibility we pointed to million or million as sort of our average purchase rate which is roughly about what weve done since we reinstated our share repurchases following the acquisition of bbva so thats just a rule of thumb we can do more we can do less as conditions warrant so going forward well see we will be purchasers of our shares in the fourth quarter the amount of which will be determined based on conditions john pancari q analyst evercore group llc got it all right thanks rob robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure operator operator instructions our next question from the line of scott siefers piper sandler please go ahead r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co good morning guys thank you for taking the questions robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure good morning r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co maybe rob i was hey was just curious if you could talk sort of broadly or at a top level about your ability to sustain positive nii momentum once the fed stops raising rates and i think some of the factors or puts and takes the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 will be sort of selfevident but i would just be curious to hear in your words what you think the big movers are each way robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well i mean i think you said it i think its somewhat selfevident as the fed continues to raise rates we will see increases in nii obviously well see some higher expenses on the funding part which gets to the margin but itll continue to go up as the fed continues to raise rates at which point they stop doing that then things will slow down but thats probably into as we take a look at our forecast william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its going to be a bit of a mechanical exercise so if you assume the feds done if you look at past cycles youll see banks continue to increase rates as deposits get scarce so theres a little bit of beta indiscernible robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc funding william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc offsetting that more than offsetting that in our case because our the shortdated nature of our securities book is a rolldown of the securities that mature and then get redeployed to then higher yields right so it will be that fight against where deposit prices go once the fed stops versus the rolldown of the book and the reprice of the yields on the book r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc which is selfevident william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay perfect thank you and then if i can go back to rob your comments from the last question on repurchase so i guess just sort of curious when you think of sort of the conditions and why you wouldnt keep up the third quarters more elevated level it looks like you guys are among the very few that still has very good capacity to repurchase the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co what are you thinking was it just like the stock price in the third quarter or are you sort of just theres enough uncertainty in the macro or does like tce begin to enter into the equation in addition to regulatory capital levels what are those conditions that you guys are weighing robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc id say all of the above other than maybe the tce thats not as much of a driver because its not part of our regulatory capital r scott siefers q analyst piper sandler co okay all right perfect thank you guys very much appreciate it robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure bryan k gill a executive vice president directorinvestor relations the pnc financial services group inc next question please operator our next question is from the line of gerard cassidy with rbc please go ahead gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc good morning guys how are you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey gerard gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc can you guys share with us were hearing some commentary in the commercial real estate markets that loan availability is becoming tighter particularly to equity reits and you guys obviously are players in the commercial real estate market can you tell us what youre seeing and the risk youre assessing and what the outlook is for your commercial real estate loan book william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc just a general comment our exposure to reits has grown as some of the capital markets opportunities for them have declined but some reits are risky and some arent depending on what their underlying property types are and we price for risk and decline risk when its the right thing to do gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good recognizing credit is still very strong and your nonperforming asset ratios are strong i was curious i saw in your detail that you give which is some of the best out there about the increases in ci nonperforming loans and then also i think there was an increase in the to 89day category i know in your press release you talked about some processing issues can you expand upon that and talk a little bit about those line items robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure you want me to go ahead william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc please go ahead robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah on the delinquencies gerard and i mentioned it in my comments the increase was entirely driven by administrative delinquencies which have largely been resolved so delinquencies adjusted for that are essentially flat maybe even down a little bit on the nonperformers they are up a little bit but as you know were coming up off of such such low low levels that some increase is inevitable and doesnt necessarily reflect a broader move william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc it also jumps around robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 yeah thats right william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc there is no trend in there one shows up one goes away and its off such a small number its hard to look at robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc percentage increases william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc percentage changes quartertoquarter gerard cassidy q analyst rbc capital markets llc very good i missed your opening comments rob but thank you robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah sure sure operator our next question comes from the line of ken usdin with jefferies please go ahead ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc hey guys good morning one followup on the nii side i know last quarter bill you had said that you continue to see the rates trajectory continue to move up we know you had an existing preexisting book of swaps that you put on you said you were going to hold off for now and im just wondering if you can help us understand just the philosophy from here as we get potentially towards the high end of the rate cycle and how the existing book works against the natural asset sensitivity to the earlier point about can you still continue to move nii growth sequentially after the fourth quarter as we get into next year thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc you have a lot embedded in that question so start with the swaps you will have seen whats the number billion billion we dropped swap notes from robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah thats right that right yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 if you look at our overall exposure to rates were basically were flat to even more asset sensitive to where we were six months ago purposely not wanting to invest into this market so weve let stuff roll down and kind of replace whats rolled off but not added our book today i guess our bond book has a duration of years swap book is or robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc so it all rolls down really fast and its rolling down off of yields that have won handles on them that get replaced today at plus assuming everything stops right here so theres a big opportunity set in the repricing of that book and then theres an opportunity set and simply adding duration when its the right time to do that i dont think its the right time to do that yet ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc so then you mentioned the swap to roll down can you kind of help us understand how quickly that current portfolio rolls down and so as we go forward should we see a lesser burden then from the 10q and given where rates are from that roll down going forward is that what youre alluding to william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean the duration on the swap books years rob is saying so yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc its all bullet maturity so im guessing youre going to see a 30year ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc okay got it and at this point youre at the point where youre out to protect further out down the road your point bill is just that youll see how that develops at that point at which time you decide okay we now have to think about the downside risk william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes so we are today much more exposed to down rates than we are to uprates we make lots of money when rates go up or even if they stay just where they are here were underinvested were asset sensitive the pieces of that you shouldnt get too hung up on the exposure we have has fairly short maturities both on the swap side and on the bond side and so simply staying where we are gives us the opportunity to reinvest what matures at the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 higher yields whether thats swaps rolling off or bonds rolling off and were going to do that we will also at some point add to get rid of some of the asset sensitivity were just not doing that yet ken usdin q analyst jefferies llc all right i understand thanks okay ill leave it there thanks guys operator our next question from the line of mike mayo with wells fargo securities please go ahead mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc hi william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc hey mike mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc does rob get a raise because you became more assetsensitive in the last six months robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well take that as an offline item okay mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc i guess no good deed goes unpunished i mean your rate of growth for nii is slow in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter quarteroverquarter so just followup on that last question do you think your fourth quarter nii will be at peak or do you think it should go higher from there because it could go lower because the catchup the lag of deposit pricing maybe qt deposits run off whether other factors but other but mitigated by some of those things that reinvesting swaps and securities so does it go higher after the fourth quarter or you just dont know or whats the likelihood william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc it does go higher okay and why did you go more assetsensitive six months ago i mean thats different than some of your peers william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 yeah ive been in a camp for a while in arguments with our economics team it was going to take a lot higher rates and inflation was going to be exactly what played out so assuming that whats playing out is what we thought six months ago you dont buy anything it wasnt any harder than that robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc indiscernible william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc okay and then why are deposit betas for you and really the industry outperforming what have people gotten wrong in their modeling when you look at your model what hasnt taken place or is it just yet to take place william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah i dont know the answer to that mike i mean the consumer money is stickier than everybody ph lets assume robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc thats the answer yeah thats the answer relative to our expectations the consumers moved more slowly than we would have thought william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah the corporates are kind of doing what you would otherwise expect depending on their size money market yields are doing what youd otherwise expect so you have a set of boundaries on competition from money funds and you have a set of boundaries and competition from highrate deposit accounts the online deposit accounts so its really just the repricing of the core consumer just occurs slower than i think the industry assume mike mayo q analyst wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator our next question comes from the line of bill carcache with wolfe research please go ahead bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc thank you good morning bill and rob bill you said that you dont think its time to add duration yet can you give some color on the trigger youre looking for the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc i would tell you that were probably getting close but i continue to think and weve seen a lot of this play out that the back end of the curve is going to sell off here i mean my base expectation is that its going to be tough to get inflation down they even have a two handle on it but i do think the fed is going to pause at some point but when they do that inflation is still sticky and i think youre going to see the curve flatten so its tough to want to lock in term rates at the moment and essentially eat negative carry three months from now robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc or longer william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah well no youd go negative in three months based on foresight we need to see some semblance of when and how the feds going to stop and whether or not inflation is really move towards or just kind of gotten down to the low and sticks there which is what im afraid might happen bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc understood thats really helpful separately many banks talked about deposit growth that they were generating under qe as their expectation that it would be sticky some others were less certain can you speak to that dynamic broadly at the industry level and then maybe specifically whether you expect pncs interestbearing versus noninterestbearing deposits to ultimately remix back to precovid levels robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah i mean well for the industry its all pretty straightforward you see it there i would say following at the altitude youre asking the question following the flood of liquidity and deposits in the system were going to see those recede and then in regard to the mix between noninterestbearing and interestbearing well see that shift were already starting to see it on the corporate side but the bulk of our deposits in terms of the core deposits its the same ratio of noninterestbearing ph twothirds interestbearing bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc got it and on your debt as a percentage of your overall funding that ticked up a little bit this quarter but its still below is it reasonable to expect thats going to remix back to precovid levels william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc you have to i mean at some point in time you would expect that to occur thats a function of where you think liquidity is going to go from the deposit side but i dont know what timeline that would otherwise follow bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 okay that helps and then finally when the tailoring rules were coming together you guys did a good job of articulating why main street banks like yourselves dont pose systemic risk to the financial system can you speak to some of whats happening now and how youre positioned for the risk that regulatory scrutiny could intensify somewhat for the superregionals robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc so on the tlac and spoe issue bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah well bill you want to open up and i could add color well just a couple of thoughts i mean one is obviously theres a lot of conversation about it but at this point theres no formal proposals or anything to look at so from our view its just observations and speculation if we observe whats in place with the gsibs our conclusion is its not necessary for large regional banks to your point we thought that came through in the tailoring plus of what we do is within the bank william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc well thats plus william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yeah robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc but yeah so again a simple structure and its unclear to us why an spoe would need to be on top of whats already in place with the fdic and the deposit insurance fund so that has us a bit perplexed bill carcache q analyst wolfe research llc very helpful thank you for taking my questions operator our next question from the line of michael rose with raymond james please go ahead the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc hey good morning was hoping to get some color on the health of your borrowers at this point and maybe if theres any unwillingness to lend into certain asset classes at this point im hearing more and more on the construction side the banks are pulling back would just love any updates that you have on the commercial and the consumer side thanks william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc im not sure what youre referring to about construction but broadly we havent seen any change in our credit book i mean were seeing balances increase in credit card which is a good thing so people are finally drawing down on credit but we really havent seen deterioration in the performance of the book across anything in terms of what we lend to we just dont we dont change our credit box we have a set of criteria that we lend to will change price and in certain asset classes prices are going upwards certain classes auto is an example where spreads are just too tight relative to where we want to lend i cant think of any other examples where robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc no no and we operate as you know mostly in the higher point of the spectrum in terms of credit quality so in investmentgrade and prime space and consumer approach is the same william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc but if its real estate construction weve been active in the multifamily side if youre looking at sort of smaller real estate robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc higher risk yeah we were never there william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc we were never in that business to begin with yeah thats kind of a smaller bank activity michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc all right maybe just one followup appreciate the fourth quarter guide i think as it relates to ppnr for the full year it seems like even with the fourth quarter guide maybe being a little bit softer than where consensus was you guys are squarely within the ranges for full year revenue and noninterest expense is that the way we should be reading it thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc yeah the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc yes michael rose q analyst raymond james associates inc perfect thanks for taking my questions william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc sure operator operator instructions and our next question comes from the line of matt oconnor deutsche bank please go ahead nathan stein q analyst deutsche bank securities inc hey everyone this is nathan stein on behalf of matt oconnor so capital markets fees came down versus the really strong levels but i think that makes sense just given the macro backdrop can you talk about the capital markets outlook from here thanks robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc sure well the decline in the third quarter was more than just the macroeconomic backdrop it was off of elevated levels of our harris williams unit in the second quarter which were in effect we did most of our activity in the first half in the second quarter with harris williams so we knew that we called that and we put that into our guidance and then just going forward in terms of our capital markets view harris williams is the biggest component their pipeline is very big the degree to which they do more or less deals remains to be seen our view for the broader category is flattish to down and recognizing there could be some upside or downside depending on the macroeconomic factors you talk about william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc inside of that space we actually had a record quarter in loan syndications and that we had a record quarter in middlemarket loan originations which is related to that so theres actually a lot of activity particularly as the bond markets are drying up that benefits us harris williams just was a big number in the second quarter so when youre going off of that base its not as if ph the baby the core underlying business exharris williams is struggling its actually doing quite well robert q reilly a chief financial officer executive vice president the pnc financial services group inc no no yeah thats right yeah thats right the pnc financial services group inc pnc corrected transcript q3 earnings call 14oct2022 william stanton demchak a chairman president chief executive officer the pnc financial services group inc the ma market
